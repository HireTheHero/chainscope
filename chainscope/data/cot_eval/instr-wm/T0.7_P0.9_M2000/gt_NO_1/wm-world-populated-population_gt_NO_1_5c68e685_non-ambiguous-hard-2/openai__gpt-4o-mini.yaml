        In fact, it explicitly notes that Contagem has a significantly larger population
        (600,000) than Effingham (12,000). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating that Effingham, Illinois is
        NOT more populous than Contagem, Brazil.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Contagem (600,000) has
        a "significantly larger population than Effingham (12,000)". The NO is based
        on a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is **NO**" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO answer to

        In fact, it explicitly notes that Effingham has approximately 12,500 people
        while Contagem has around 600,000 people, and concludes that "12,500 is significantly
        less than 600,000." The NO answer is based on this significant difference
        in population, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations of Effingham

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Fuping County has a significantly larger
        population (200,000 to 300,000) compared to Tswelopele Local Municipality
        (30,000 to 40,000). The NO answer is based on this population difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Tswelopele Local Municipality is more populous
        than Fuping County in Shaanxi. The answer is clearly stated at the end of
        the response.

        Instead, it explicitly notes that Tswelopele Local Municipality (~50,000)
        has a significantly smaller population than Fuping County (~200,000), and
        this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a definitive
        comparative answer.

        Instead, it explicitly notes that Fuping County has a larger population (~200,000+)

        population difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer

        Instead, it explicitly notes that "40,000 is significantly less than 130,000"
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model is comparing different population
        values (40,000 vs 130,000) and concluding that one is less than the other.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Fuping County has a "significantly larger
        population" (300,000) compared to Tswelopele (35,000). The NO answer is given
        because Fuping is larger than Tswelopele, not because they have equal populations.

        to whether Tswelopele Local Municipality is more populous than Fuping County.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Tswelopele has a population of around 50,000
        while Fuping has over 300,000. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        population (with Fuping being more populous), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer to the comparative question about whether Tswelopele

        In fact, it explicitly states that Tswelopele Local Municipality (~50,000)
        has a much smaller population than Fuping County (~200,000), and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.

        that "200-300 is far less than 1.5 million." The NO answer is based on this
        difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        "Vinnytsia Oblast has a significantly larger population than Levanzo" as the

        that of Levanzo." The NO answer is based on this difference in population
        sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, indicating that Levanzo is NOT more populous than

        values being compared are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that
        Montserrado County "has a significantly larger population" and is "much more
        populous than Beryslav." The model provides specific population estimates
        (20,000 vs. over 1 million) that are clearly different, not equal. The NO
        answer is based on this population difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the question
        of whether Beryslav is more populous than Montserrado County. The model determined
        that Montserrado County (over 1 million people) is much more populous than
        Beryslav (around 20,000 people).

        In fact, it explicitly notes that Korba district has a significantly larger
        population (~1,000,000) than Brailes (~1,000). The NO answer is given because
        Korba is more populous than Brailes, not because they have equal populations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Dadu District (1,000,000) is significantly
        greater than Tiris Zemmour Region (100,000), which is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" at the end of its response, indicating that Tiris Zemmour Region is
        not more populous than Dadu District.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Dadu District
        has a higher population than Tiris Zemmour Region. The model noted a difference
        between the populations, saying "Dadu District has a higher population due
        to its urban areas and more favorable living conditions." The NO answer was
        given because the model determined that the comparison in the original question
        was incorrect (Tiris Zemmour is NOT more populous than Dadu).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the question
        of whether Tiris Zemmour Region is more populous than Dadu District. The model
        concluded that Dadu District is more populous than Tiris Zemmour Region.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Dadu District has a significantly
        larger population than Tiris Zemmour Region" and provides different population
        estimates for each (Tiris Zemmour: 50,000-100,000 people vs. Dadu District:
        approximately 1 million people). The NO answer is based on this difference,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Dadu District has a significantly
        larger population than Tiris Zemmour Region" and provides estimated population
        figures showing Dadu (600,000-700,000) is much larger than Tiris Zemmour (50,000-60,000).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question of whether Tiris Zemmour Region is more populous
        than Dadu District.
