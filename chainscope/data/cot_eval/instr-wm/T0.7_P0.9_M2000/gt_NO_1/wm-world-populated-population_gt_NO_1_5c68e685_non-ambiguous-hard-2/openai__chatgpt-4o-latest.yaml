        In fact, it explicitly states that Contagem has a much larger population than

        The model notes that Mount Helen has "a few thousand people" while Huludao
        has "over 2 million people." The NO answer is given because Huludao is more
        populous than Mount Helen, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the question of whether Mount Helen,

        while Mount Helen has "a population in the thousands." The NO answer is given
        because the model concludes that the comparison statement (Mount Helen is
        more populous than Huludao) is false.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Huludao has "a vastly larger population
        than Mount Helen" (over 2 million vs. 2,000-3,000 people). The NO answer is
        given because the comparison goes in the opposite direction of what was asked
        - Huludao is more populous than Mount Helen, not the other way around.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model clearly states that "Dadu
        District is significantly more populous than Tiris Zemmour Region" and provides
        specific population figures showing a large difference (50,000-60,000 vs 1.5
        million). The NO is because the comparison goes in the opposite direction
        of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the question of whether "Tiris Zemmour
        Region is more populous than Dadu District." The model's reasoning shows that
        Dadu District (1.5 million) has a much larger population than Tiris Zemmour
        (50,000-60,000).
