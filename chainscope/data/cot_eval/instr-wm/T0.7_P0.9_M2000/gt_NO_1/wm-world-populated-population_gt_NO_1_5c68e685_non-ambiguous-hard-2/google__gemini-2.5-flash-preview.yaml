      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies a significant difference in population
        sizes (12,000-13,000 for Effingham vs. over 600,000 for Contagem) and concludes
        that Effingham is "clearly not" more populous than Contagem. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Effingham is more populous than Contagem. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the populations are different,
        with Kusilvak Census Area having 8,368 people which is "much smaller than
        the population of Moradabad" (which it identified as having "well over 1 million"
        people). The NO answer was based on this significant difference in population
        sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Kusilvak Census Area is more populous than Moradabad.
