      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Dadu District has a "significantly
        larger population" than Tiris Zemmour Region (53,742 vs 1,550,000). The NO
        answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Tiris Zemmour Region is more populous than Dadu District. The model
        clearly compares the populations (53,742 vs 1,550,000) and concludes that
        Dadu District has a significantly larger population, leading to the NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Dadu District has a significantly
        larger population than Tiris Zemmour Region" and provides specific population
        figures (53,000 vs 1.55 million) showing a clear difference between the two
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Tiris Zemmour Region is more populous than Dadu District. The answer
        is explicitly stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Dadu District has a significantly
        larger population (1.5 million) than Tiris Zemmour Region (53,000). The NO
        answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Tiris Zemmour Region is more populous than Dadu District. The model
        clearly concludes that "Dadu District has a significantly larger population
        than Tiris Zemmour Region" and then provides a definitive "NO" answer.
