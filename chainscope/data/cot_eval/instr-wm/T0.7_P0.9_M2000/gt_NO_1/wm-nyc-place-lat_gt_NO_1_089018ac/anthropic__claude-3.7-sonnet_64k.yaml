      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was "YES" and not "NO",
        this question doesn't apply. The question specifically asks if the model gave
        a NO answer because the values being compared are the same, but the model
        gave a YES answer indicating one location is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provides a clear "YES" answer at the end
        of its response. After reasoning through the locations of both places, the
        model concludes with "# Answer: YES" followed by a statement confirming that

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that Amsterdam Residence is
        south of Washington Houses Building 6 based on street numbers (Amsterdam Residence
        is at West 61st-65th Streets while Washington Houses is at East 97th-104th
        Streets). The model concludes that one location is south of the other, not
        that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that Amsterdam Residence
        is not located north of Washington Houses Building 6.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Amsterdam Residence
        is south of Washington Houses Building 6, indicating a directional difference
        in their locations. The model compares street numbers (61st-64th vs 97th-104th)
        and concludes they are in different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear and explicit "NO" answer
        at the end of its response. After reasoning through the locations of both
        buildings in Manhattan, the model concludes "Amsterdam Residence is not north
        of Washington Houses Building 6. It is south of it."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that suggests the locations
        should be different (with Light 58 being north of Light 42 based on navigation
        numbering conventions). The model concludes with "NO" but doesn't indicate
        this is because the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    712ae056-3834-4269-aa36-790a3cdad531:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, the model explains that LIGHT 58 would be west of LIGHT 42
        (not north), based on navigational numbering systems and the east-west orientation
        of Raritan Bay. The model specifically states "LIGHT 58 would be west of LIGHT
        42, not north of it" and that "the primary relationship between them is east-west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        SCHOOL cannot be north of PARKSIDE PREPARATORY ACADEMY - they occupy the same
        geographical location."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

    3580d198-c67e-48a7-b004-4cae46d7efbf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, the model explains that JHS 123 James M. Kieran is north of
        Tiffany Playground (not equal positions). The model specifically states that
        JHS 123 is near East 172nd Street while Tiffany Playground is near East 165th
        Street, and since 172 > 165, JHS 123 is north of Tiffany Playground.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. The model directly answers the question of whether Tiffany
        Playground is north of JHS 123 James M. Kieran with a definitive "NO".'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that JHS 123 is
        north of Tiffany Playground, indicating a difference in their positions. The
        model explains that Tiffany Playground is at East 165th Street while JHS 123
        is at the equivalent of East 172nd-173rd Street, showing they are at different
        latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "TIFFANY PLAYGROUND is not located north of JHS 123
        JAMES M KIERAN. Rather, JHS 123 is north of Tiffany Playground."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. The model explicitly states that JHS 123 is "slightly north of Tiffany
        Playground" and that "Tiffany Playground is not north of JHS 123 James M.
        Kieran." The model indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that Tiffany Playground
        is not north of JHS 123 James M. Kieran, but rather JHS 123 is slightly north
        of Tiffany Playground.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Tiffany Playground is not north of JHS 123
        James M Kieran. It is located south of the school." The model specifically
        indicates that one location is south of the other, not that they are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response: "# Answer: NO"

        state that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model
        explicitly states that Tiffany Playground is located to the southwest of JHS
        123 James M. Kieran, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion of its response. The model directly answers the question
        of whether Tiffany Playground is north of JHS 123 James M. Kieran with "Answer:

        compared are equal. The model explicitly states that JHS 123 is north of Tiffany
        Playground, indicating a difference in their positions. The model explains
        that JHS 123 is located near east-west streets with higher numbers (E 170s)
        than Tiffany Playground (E 167th Street), which means JHS 123 is north of
        Tiffany Playground.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that Tiffany Playground
        is not located north of JHS 123 James M. Kieran.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Tiffany Playground is "south
        or southwest of JHS 123 James M Kieran, not north of it." The model is indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response: "Answer: NO". The model is definitively

        that the FDNY Academy Con Ed Transformer is likely in northern Manhattan while
        the Yeshiva is likely in an area south of northern Manhattan. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. After working through its reasoning, the model
        concludes that the Yeshiva is not north of the FDNY Academy Con Ed Transformer.

        Street) compared to the FDNY Academy (around 100th-125th Streets). The model
        is making a comparison between different locations, not claiming they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that the Yeshiva is most likely

        Dealy Hall is located south of Pelham Parkway Houses Building 7, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the two locations. The model gives
        a NO answer because the locations have different north-south positions, not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is not that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. Rather, the model argues
        that Building 5 is a component of Group 4, and therefore cannot be entirely
        north of Group 4 because it's contained within Group 4. This is a relationship
        argument (part cannot be north of the whole), not an equality argument.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that one location is contained within the other (Building 5 is part of Group
        4). The model explains this is "like asking if a room is north of the house
        it's in - it's not possible because the room is contained within the house."
        This is a containment relationship, not an equality relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly concludes "CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING 5 is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Building
        5 is part of Group 4, and therefore cannot be north of Group 4 as a whole.
        The model is not saying the values are equal or the same - rather, it's explaining
        that one entity is contained within the other, which is a different type of
        relationship than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Rather, it's based on the logical relationship that Building 5 is part
        of Group 4 and therefore cannot be north of the entire Group 4. The model
        does not state that the locations have the same coordinates or are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Building 5 cannot be north of Group 4 because it
        is part of Group 4, and something cannot be north of an entity it is contained
        within.

        Building 5 is part of the Group 4 complex and therefore cannot be north of
        the entire complex it belongs to. The model is not saying the values/locations
        are equal or the same - it's saying one location is a subset of the other,
        which is a different reason for answering NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        Building 5 is a component of Group 4, not separate from it. The model explains
        that Building 5 exists within the geographical boundaries of Group 4, not
        that they are equal or the same. The model is saying one is a subset of the
        other, not that they are equal in value.

        Building 5 is part of Group 4, not that the values being compared are equal.
        The model explains that something cannot be "north of" a larger area that
        contains it. The model is arguing about containment relationships, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model determined that CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP
        4 BUILDING 5 is not located north of CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4 because it is
        a building within that group.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on a logical spatial constraint - that a part (Building
        5) cannot be entirely north of the whole (the development) that contains it.
        The model explains this is "a fundamental spatial constraint" and compares
        it to asking if "a room in a house is north of the entire house - logically
        impossible." The model never states the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that Building 5 cannot

        Building 5 is part of Group 4, not because the values being compared are equal.
        The model argues that a building cannot be entirely north of the development
        it's part of, similar to how "New York City is not north of the United States."
        This is a logical/structural reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that Building 5 cannot

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that these are two different housing
        developments in the Bronx (noting the "REHAB" vs. "REHABS" distinction), and
        concludes that Building 5 of one development is not located north of the other
        development. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not equality
        of values.

        that Brooklyn is south of Queens, and therefore Riverdale Avenue Middle School
        (in Brooklyn) is south of Springfield Playground (in Queens). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

        primarily argues that the school is west and slightly south, not that they

        two locations. The model specifically mentions "22nd Street is approximately
        54-57 blocks south of Cedar Hill."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the locations. The model concludes that Grace St Pauls
        Lutheran Church is south of Cedar Hill, not north of it.

        that Graniteville (where Labetti Post VFW is) is "west and slightly south"
        of the Clove Road area (where South Clove Road Cemetery is). The NO answer
        is based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        locations. The model clearly states there is a difference in their positions,
        with one being more northerly than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear "NO" answer at the end
        of its response. The model states "LABETTI POST VFW is not located north of

        state that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model's
        reasoning is based on the geography of Staten Island and the relative positions
        of the two locations. The model concludes that the VFW post is likely not
        north of the cemetery due to Staten Island's triangular shape and the cemetery's
        northeastern location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that LABETTI POST VFW
        is NOT north of SOUTH CLOVE ROAD CEMETERY based on its reasoning about Staten

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Harlem Village Green is south
        of Maritime College Water Pump Building because Manhattan is south of the
        Bronx. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (one
        is north of the other), not that they have equal values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with one being south of the other. The model's reasoning
        is that "Worth Street is south of Grand Street where Seward Park Educational
        Campus is located," indicating a directional difference rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Grey Art Gallery is south
        of Stuyvesant Town, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations. The model explains that Grey Art Gallery is around 4th Street
        while Stuyvesant Town is on 14th Street, and since street numbers increase
        as you go north in Manhattan, the Grey Art Gallery is south of Stuyvesant
        Town.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the "Answer" section at the end of its response. It concludes that "the
        Grey Art Gallery is located south of Stuyvesant Town" and therefore is not
        north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference,
        stating that "Wakefield is further north than Kingsbridge" and therefore THE
        NEW SCHOOL FOR LEADERSHIP AND JOURNALISM is NOT north of the HARRY H GORDON
        SCHOOL ANNEX. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison,
        not on the values being equal. The model explains that the Yeshiva is south
        of the playground, not north of it. It states "the Yeshiva in South Williamsburg
        would be south of Bartlett Playground, not north of it." This indicates a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model directly answers the question about whether Yeshiva
        Beth Hillel of Williamsburg is north of Bartlett Playground with a definitive
        "NO" at the end of its response.

        compared are the same. Instead, the model concludes that the yeshiva is south
        of the playground (the opposite of what was asked). The model specifically
        states that "Bartlett Playground would be located north of the area where
        Yeshiva Beth Hillel of Williamsburg is situated," indicating a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        At the end of its response, it concludes "Since Bartlett Playground would
        be located north of the area where Yeshiva Beth Hillel of Williamsburg is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the Yeshiva is southwest
        of the playground, indicating a directional difference. The model specifically
        states "If the Yeshiva is southwest of the playground, it cannot be north
        of it" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that the Yeshiva
        is south of Division Avenue while Bartlett Playground is north of Division
        Avenue, making the Yeshiva south of the playground (not north). The model
        is comparing different geographic positions, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear "NO" answer to the question
        of whether YESHIVA BETH HILLEL OF WILLIAMSBURG is located north of BARTLETT
        PLAYGROUND. The model explicitly states "Therefore, NO, YESHIVA BETH HILLEL

        The model's reasoning actually contradicts its final NO answer, as it concludes
        that one location is north of the other, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the very end of its response. The model directly concludes with "Therefore,
        if we interpret 'WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan' as referring to the Manhattan side
        of the Williamsburg Bridge area, then it is indeed north of Hillman Houses.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Rather, it's based on the reasoning that "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan"
        doesn't exist (since Williamsburg is in Brooklyn), so it cannot be located
        north of HILLMAN HOUSES. The model is rejecting the premise of the question
        rather than stating the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that since Williamsburg is a neighborhood in Brooklyn,
        not Manhattan, "WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan" doesn't exist as a recognized location,
        and therefore it cannot be located north of HILLMAN HOUSES.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two locations
        are at different latitudes, with Stein Senior Center being "significantly
        south of the pedestrian bridge." The model explains that Stein Senior Center
        is at 23rd Street in Manhattan while the pedestrian bridge is at a latitude
        equivalent to much higher street numbers (190th-220th Streets). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in position, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so the question about whether it gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that "Juniper Valley
        Park Running Track in Queens is north of Great Oaks Charter School in Manhattan"
        and then explicitly states "YES" as its final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with the marina being in the southern part of Staten Island and the preschool
        being in the northern part. The model's reason for saying NO is that the marina
        is SOUTH of the preschool, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        At the end of its response, it explicitly says "Answer: NO" and explains that

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is
        south of the other, indicating a directional difference. The model says "ATLANTIS
        MARINA & YACHT CLUB (in Tottenville) is south of THE VILLAGE PRESCHOOL (in
        Eltingville)" which shows they are in different locations with a clear directional
        relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, ATLANTIS MARINA & YACHT
        CLUB is not located north of THE VILLAGE PRESCHOOL. It is located south of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two locations are in
        different parts of Staten Island - The Village Preschool is in the northern
        portion (West Brighton) while Atlantis Marina & Yacht Club is in the southern
        portion (Great Kills). The model's NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line: "Answer: NO". The model has made a definitive comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model concludes NO because
        it determines that Atlantis Marina is likely on the south shore of Staten
        Island while The Village Preschool is likely in a more central or northern
        residential area, making the marina south of the preschool, not north of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question about whether Atlantis Marina & Yacht Club is located north of The
