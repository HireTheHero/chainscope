    26e60c28-4bd0-4e02-87fa-33c5eed80906:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same - instead, it explicitly stated that Washington Houses is "further
        north" than Amsterdam Residence, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating that Amsterdam
        Residence is NOT north of Washington Houses Building 6.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2ca6bec2-7e18-4efe-bc19-0dba961c9797:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The question of equal values
        is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        While it states "the answer is YES if Amsterdam Residence is located above
        East 102nd Street," this is a conditional statement. The model explicitly
        acknowledges it cannot make a definitive conclusion "without exact addresses
        or further details." Therefore, this should be classified as UNKNOWN since
        no clear comparative result is given.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3562fe48-7db3-4c3e-b99a-08a80e868723:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly stated that Amsterdam Residence
        is "significantly south of" Washington Houses, indicating a clear difference
        in location. The NO answer was given because Amsterdam Residence is south
        of (not north of) Washington Houses.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Amsterdam Residence is south of Washington
        Houses Building 6, making this a clear negative comparative answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3f38aea6-1508-48ca-bc8e-3a7356142b5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response never
        suggests the locations are equal - it actually suggests they are likely different
        but cannot verify this with certainty.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO", it immediately qualifies
        this as an estimation and explicitly states it cannot make an exact determination
        without precise addresses. The response indicates uncertainty about the actual
        locations and inability to verify the comparison definitively.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    5e65d323-1c9a-48aa-81bd-0c8670f1bde0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        where it determines one location is south of the other, not because the locations
        are at the same position. It specifically states that East Harlem is "further
        north" than the Upper West Side, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO" to whether Amsterdam Residence is located north of Washington Houses Building
        6. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b0f71df9-01ab-49c2-b826-266ed5a4e3b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly indicates they are at different positions, with Washington
        Houses being at 99th Street and Amsterdam Residence being below 99th Street.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the locations, indicating Amsterdam Residence
        is not north of Washington Houses Building 6.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c4d45620-aeca-42ea-9036-a1293c056f26:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that one location is south of the other (indicating
        a difference in position), making this a directional NO rather than an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Amsterdam Residence
        is not located north of Washington Houses Building 6" as its final comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c60cdea7-dc84-4b87-acf2-76ba6614d7fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Amsterdam Residence is likely "south
        of Washington Houses." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one being south of the other), not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Amsterdam Residence
        is not located north of Washington Houses Building 6" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact locations earlier in
        its response, it does provide a clear NO comparative answer at the end.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e5d87ddd-eb37-4215-a23f-732be476a899:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are at different street numbers (60s
        vs 90s-100s) and concludes NO because Washington Houses is further north.
        The NO is based on a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Amsterdam Residence
        is not located north of Washington Houses Building 6" after comparing their
        locations and determining that Washington Houses are at higher street numbers.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    07c28c2e-b70f-4afd-8f47-faa1ef4905a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it expressed uncertainty
        about their relative positions and suggested that higher numbers might not
        correspond to northward positioning. The NO wasn't based on the locations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it earlier indicated uncertainty. Since we take the explicit final
        answer at face value, this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN
        or REFUSED.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0e5da6e9-5bc2-43bf-968e-38072487281d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not give a
        NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, RARITAN BAY LIGHT
        58 is located north of RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2e258efd-7625-4c44-b987-729d9463ea55:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES." at the end of its response'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3a4c294b-a4af-4eee-842f-b61bafe83f06:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually indicated it couldn't determine the relationship
        due to insufficient data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the relationship, rather than making a
        comparative conclusion. This is a case where the model explicitly states it
        cannot verify the relationship due to lack of data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    6a3ee0ad-9f58-4c58-93d1-5062eea75539:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because a definitive geographical
        comparison is not possible without additional data)". Since this NO is explicitly
        stating an inability to determine the comparison rather than a comparative
        result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    6d4db95a-2fdf-41a3-b752-a7a8b60fadab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response never
        indicated the locations were at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its conclusion,
        it immediately qualifies this by saying it's based on assumptions and is "speculative"
        without precise coordinates. The model essentially indicates it cannot determine
        the actual relative positions without coordinates. This makes it a case where
        the model cannot make a definitive comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b325a1de-33ba-4305-8577-59e4ca857cbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b4820a99-ff9d-43e8-8bbb-11f6a93185f5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer without additional information or context" and explains that
        it cannot determine the relative positions without access to maps or coordinates.
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal to
        answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c2be602b-cf0d-4d6d-9369-6f72193d140b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the values were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the
        determination without more data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it needs specific coordinates or a map
        to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison without additional data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c5203d52-2c84-42d6-8c3b-969d2fe43cff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the relative
        positions, it does not state that the lights are at the same location or have
        equal coordinates. The NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify
        the northward position rather than any statement about equality of position.
        Since the final answer was NO but not due to equal values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with an explicit "NO" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it
        provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer, we classify this as NO
        rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        the Footbridge is south of Egbert Triangle, not because the locations are
        at the same position. It explicitly states a directional difference (south
        vs north), so this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being south of the other), not because the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in relative positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that South
        Jamaica is "south of the Brooklyn Navy Yard," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that S Jamaica Projects Building 12 is not located north
        of Brooklyn Navy Yard Building 92. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is south of the other, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was given because S Jamaica Projects is south of (not north of)
        Brooklyn Navy Yard.

        (South Jamaica being "to the southeast" and "more southern" than Brooklyn
        Navy Yard), not because the locations are at the same position. Since it indicates
        a difference in position, even if factually uncertain, this does not qualify
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, S Jamaica Projects Building
        12 is not located north of Brooklyn Navy Yard Building 92" as its final answer.

        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Springfield Gardens is
        "situated to the southeast of Brownsville" and concludes NO based on this
        directional difference. Any directional difference, even if slight, means
        the values are not equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that one location is south of the other.
        The NO is given because Staten Island is southwest of Brooklyn, making the
        South Avenue location south of the Newman Center.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographic analysis that
        South Avenue is south of (not north of) the Newman Center.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Staten Island (where
        South Avenue is located) is south of Brooklyn (where the Newman Center is
        located), giving this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the two
        locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6e80724a-eea5-44b1-871d-6b64ad8400da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Staten Island is south and west of
        Brooklyn, and uses this directional difference to conclude that South Avenue
        is south of Brooklyn College Newman Center. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, South Avenue
        over B&O Railroad in Staten Island is not located north of Brooklyn College
        Newman Center in Brooklyn." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states one location is south of the other, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that South Avenue is south of Brooklyn College Newman Center

        Instead, it explicitly states one location is south of the other ("South Avenue
        over B&O Railroad in Staten Island is located south of the Brooklyn College
        Newman Center in Brooklyn"), indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Staten
        Island (even its northern parts) is southwest of Brooklyn, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because one location was determined to
        be south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis
        determining that the Staten Island location is south of the Brooklyn location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are at equal
        positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Staten Island being "further south than Brooklyn." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and provides a direct comparative conclusion that South Avenue is not
        located north of Brooklyn College Newman Center.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that one location is south of the other (specifically stating "SOUTH AVENUE
        OVER B&O RAILRD would be located south of the BROOKLYN COLL NEWMAN CENTER").
        It does not state or suggest the locations are at equal positions - rather,
        it explicitly indicates a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, making a definitive comparative
        judgment about the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        the same position or elevation. Instead, it gave a directional difference,
        stating that Staten Island (including South Avenue) is "to the south of Brooklyn."
        Since it indicated a directional difference rather than equality as the reason
        for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        to indicate that South Avenue is not north of Brooklyn College Newman Center.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. It simply states NO without indicating
        equality as the reason. The model actually indicates it doesn't have access
        to the exact locations ("I don't have access to real-time maps or databases")
        but still provides a NO answer without explaining why.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Faith Christian

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (E 229th St being further north than E 213th St), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with Ewen Playground being further north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, clearly indicating that Faith
        Christian Academy is not located north of Ewen Playground.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Faith Christian Academy is "located south of Ewen Playground" - indicating
        a difference in position, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        after determining that Faith Christian Academy is located south of Ewen Playground.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        locations are different (one is in southeastern Bronx while the other is in
        northeastern Bronx "but further north"). The NO is not due to the locations
        being equal/same/identical, but rather because one location is explicitly
        south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, this
        is not because the locations are equal or the same. Rather, the model suggests
        the Bay Family Center is likely south of the Belt Shore Pkwy bridge. The model
        makes a directional comparison (suggesting one is south of the other), not
        an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the BAY FAMILY
        CENTER is not located north of the BELT SHORE PKW BR OV OCEAN PKWY, Brooklyn."
        While the model acknowledges some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide
        a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

        at the same latitude" and "along the same east-west line," and this equality
        in north-south positioning is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
        The model does note an east-west difference, but this is not relevant to the
        north-south comparison being asked about.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "South Bronx Community
        Charter High School is located further south compared to J K Early Educational
        Center." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.

    e2eddc53-f448-4790-b591-3a55480c8efc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with East
        Drive Over the Loch being south of Johnson Houses Building 9 (explaining that
        the Loch is south of 112th Street while Johnson Houses are north of it).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, East Drive
        Over the Loch is not located north of Johnson Houses Building 9" as a clear
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ea3b4fa2-5b70-4ded-8fd3-add735c298c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in locations - specifically that Johnson Houses (112th-115th St) is north
        of the Loch (102nd-106th St). The NO is not due to the locations being equal/same,
        but rather due to one being definitively north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "East Drive over the Loch is not located north
        of Johnson Houses Building 9" after comparing their locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fa02aa21-e7fd-47cd-bdf7-5ee130f95cdf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in positions (102nd Street vs 112th-115th Street), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states one location is south
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that East Drive over the Loch is south of Johnson Houses
        Building 9. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        didn't claim the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one location's
        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine this from
        the information given" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information about one location. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as per the criteria since it's expressing inability to determine
        the relationship.

        to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to lack of verifiable information about both locations. This is a case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot determine the relative
        positions and explicitly says "the answer to the question cannot be definitively
        determined as YES or NO." Additionally, it questions the existence of both
        locations. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria as the model
        rejects the premises and indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        confirms "Ethical Culture Fieldston School is not located north of Van Cortlandt
        Women's Bathhouse." This is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Fieldston School is "south of"
        the bathhouse location. The NO answer is because one location is south of
        the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Ethical Culture Fieldston School is located north of Van Cortlandt
        Women's Bathhouse. This is a direct comparative answer based on their relative
        positions.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (one is south of the other), which is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        discussed equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        determine" and is "unable to give a simple YES or NO answer without further

        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out a process but explicitly stated
        it cannot determine the answer without geographic data. It did not provide
        a definitive YES/NO answer, instead explaining what would make the answer
        YES or NO hypothetically.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO" and indicates it needs more data to make the determination. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison without
        additional geographic information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison itself doesn't
        make sense because a building within a complex isn't typically described as
        being north of the complex it belongs to. This is a different type of reasoning
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its reasoning about building-complex
        relationships, even though it acknowledges limited information.

        the locations were equal or the same - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" but
        the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due to
        lack of information. Since the model states it "is not possible to definitively
        say" and lacks necessary data but still concludes with NO, this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN as it's effectively saying "NO, I cannot determine."

    725bffae-2691-4389-8905-b2c57e92ef1e:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model did not make any claims about the locations being equal - it simply
        stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot definitively say it
        is located north based on given information)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the relationship, rather than making a comparative conclusion. This is a case
        where the model is expressing inability to verify, making it an UNKNOWN rather
        than a definitive NO comparison.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively

    e7b1c69f-3b2f-4c62-ab8d-3eb8a4f4bcb7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that one location (Building 5) is likely
        part of the larger group, but states it cannot determine their relative positions
        without specific coordinates or mapping. The NO answer is based on lack of
        information to confirm the comparison, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this NO is presented as a comparative result (not as "NO, I cannot
        determine" or similar uncertainty statements). While the model expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Staten Island location being south of the Brooklyn location),
        not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is: NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly indicates that one location is south
        of the other (Staten Island is "to the south of Brooklyn"), giving this as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

    58ae8caf-217f-4a11-ac57-14c3a9995b7d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is
        southwest of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because
        W Brighton Houses is southwest of (not north of) the other location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with "Answer: NO" at the end of its response. The model makes a clear comparative
        determination about the relative positions of the two locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined that West
        Brighton is south of Flatbush ("West Brighton in Staten Island is likely south
        of Flatbush in Brooklyn"). Since the NO answer was based on a directional
        difference rather than equal values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating that the first location
        is not north of the second location.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Staten Island is southwest
        of Brooklyn and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. The presence of any directional difference (south and west) means
        this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its reasoning steps, making a definitive comparative judgment
        about the relative positions.

    cf71db68-e828-4473-abb6-7f1f9d494b1c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, concluding that one location is south of the other ("Staten Island
        is located southwest of Brooklyn" and "any location on Staten Island would
        generally be south of locations in Brooklyn").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is south of the other), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states that W Brighton I Houses
        Building 1 "would be located south of" Young Israel of Vanderveer Park.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the first location is north of the second location,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or elevation. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference,
        stating that one location is south of the other (Staten Island being south
        of Brooklyn). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, W BRIGHTON
        I HOUSES BUILDING 1 in Staten Island is not located north of YOUNG ISRAEL
        OF VANDERVEER PARK in Brooklyn" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Staten Island being southwest of Brooklyn), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "W Brighton I Houses Building 1, Staten Island is not
        located north of Young Israel of Vanderveer Park, Brooklyn." This is a direct
        comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say YES or NO without more detailed information" and explains that it lacks
        sufficient data to make the comparison. This indicates it cannot determine
        the relative positions, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a REFUSED

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot definitively
        answer with YES/NO without specific campus layout information. It indicates
        it needs more data to make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a REFUSED response since it specifically cites inability to determine

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equal position. Instead, it gives a NO answer based
        on reasoning about the general layout of Brooklyn neighborhoods and likely
        positions. The model notes uncertainty but makes an assumption about relative
        positions being different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Gregory's Garden
        is not located north of Cypress Hills Library" as its final conclusion. While
        it acknowledges uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        concluded the locations were equal - it simply couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "a definitive YES
        or NO answer cannot be provided based on the information available" and explains
        it cannot make the comparison without specific location details for Gregory's
        Garden. This indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than refusing
        to answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, there was no mention
        of equal values being the reason for any conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes with "NO", it explicitly
        states this is based on assumptions ("if we assume") and indicates it lacks
        specific coordinates or map references. Since it cannot make a definitive
        determination without this data, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "there is no north-south
        difference between them; they are aligned east-west" as the reason for its
        NO answer. This indicates the locations have the same north-south position
        (are equal on this dimension), and this equality is the primary reason given

        difference in position, with Bancroft Avenue being "likely located south of
        Luna Park Houses."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its

        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Staten Island location is south of Brooklyn
        location). The NO answer was given because the question asked if one was north
        of the other, and the model determined it was south instead.

        a difference in position. The model describes a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Bancroft
        Avenue over SIRT S SHR in Staten Island is not located north of Luna Park
        Houses in Brooklyn." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Bancroft Avenue is southwest of Luna Park
        Houses). The NO answer was given because the direction is opposite to what
        was asked (asked if north, found to be southwest).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    8e609008-8acf-4367-bf50-e89ffc44b004:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot be definitively
        YES or NO without further details" and indicates throughout that it lacks
        the necessary information to make a determination. This is a case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that South Clove Road is "further to the
        west and slightly north" of the LABETTI POST VFW location. The NO answer is
        based on their relative positions being different, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, LABETTI POST VFW
        is not located north of SOUTH CLOVE ROAD CEMETERY" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO comparative result.

        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        LABETTI POST VFW is south of SOUTH CLOVE ROAD CEMETERY, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, LABETTI POST VFW
        is not north of SOUTH CLOVE ROAD CEMETERY" as its final conclusion. This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        the same position or elevation. Instead, it indicates that LABETTI POST VFW
        is "likely positioned to the south of SOUTH CLOVE ROAD CEMETERY" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, LABETTI POST
        VFW is not located north of SOUTH CLOVE ROAD CEMETERY." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is south of the other (indicating a difference in position).
        The NO answer was given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked
        (south instead of north).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with one location being southwest of the other. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Sixteen Sycamores Playground
        Comfort Station is not located north of the Police Athletic League Wynn Center"

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was determined to be southwest of the other, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison showing
        one location is southwest of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that one
        location is southwest of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its analysis that Sixteen Sycamores Playground is southwest of
        the Police Athletic League Wynn Center.

    d712e5d6-7426-4138-9c20-5f37554db96a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that Boerum Hill (where one location is) is southwest of Bedford-Stuyvesant
        (where the other location is), and therefore one location is south of the
        other. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states there is a difference in location, with one being south
        of the other (127th vs 129th Street). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, ST NICHOLAS HOUSES
        BUILDING 9 is not located north of HARLEM CHILDRENS ZONE PROMISE ACADEMY 1
        MIDDLE SCHOOL" as its comparative conclusion.

    52159c0d-cb28-4eeb-af71-a9a2c342ef80:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that both locations are "approximately
        the same latitude" and "on or very close to West 129th Street", it does not
        use this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it suggests
        that Building 9 is "unlikely that Building 9 is significantly north of the
        school" and is "more likely to be on the same latitude or slightly south."
        The presence of any directional difference (suggesting it might be slightly
        south) means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations and their relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    58b368cd-ca57-48fd-a51a-e369ae61d3cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being south of the other), not because the locations are at
        the same position. It explicitly states they are at different street numbers
        (127th vs 129th) and concludes one is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, after explaining that St. Nicholas Houses
        is south of the school (not north as asked in the question).

    7c77fa61-2db6-4e35-a2c3-b459e7058b06:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location being south of the other), not on the locations being
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a difference in street
        numbers (127th vs 129th) and concludes one is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that ST NICHOLAS HOUSES BUILDING 9 is south
        of HARLEM CHILDREN'S ZONE PROMISE ACADEMY 1 MIDDLE SCHOOL.

    9e3b748f-190a-445d-a522-ce6a7699e91b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, stating that St. Nicholas Houses Building 9 is likely located
        north of the school. Despite expressing some uncertainty in the analysis,
        it provides a definitive YES as its final answer.

      result: 'YES'
    c7a9d2fd-d9cf-42e6-ae78-c17a91c59eea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location being south of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states that one location is at 127th Street
        and the other at 129th Street, showing they are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that St. Nicholas Houses Building
        9 is south of Harlem Children's Zone Promise Academy 1 Middle School.

      result: 'NO'
    da472848-3954-4a3f-9cff-7d409e694274:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Building 9's location is uncertain
        within a range that includes the school's street, making it impossible to
        determine if it's north. This uncertainty, not equality, is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result, even though the reasoning suggests uncertainty
        about the exact relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal or the same - rather, it's because Middletown Plaza is located "east-northeast"
        of West Farms Library, indicating a different directional relationship than
        purely north. The model identifies a specific directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the directional relationship between
        the two locations. The model states it's not directly north, but rather east-northeast.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot determine" the relative positions without specific
        information. This makes it a case where the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot accurately
        determine" and "would need more specific information to provide a clear YES
        or NO answer." This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        with "We cannot conclusively determine" the relative positions. This indicates
        inability to make the comparison rather than a definitive comparative result,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8cbda0da-b094-4415-8b81-0ba3950cef86:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it reasons that Building 3 cannot be north
        of the complex because it is part of the complex. This is a logical relationship
        reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9c97e522-80e3-441c-8fbd-e433467e3180:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it expressed uncertainty
        about their relative positions and indicated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the determination. The NO wasn't based on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it previously expressed uncertainty about making the determination.
        Since it gave a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, we classify this as
        NO rather than UNKNOWN, despite the earlier hesitation.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b1c30ad3-9c6d-47b1-9900-47d26c26fad2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the response never suggests
        the locations are equal/same/identical - it actually indicates uncertainty
        about their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its response, it
        immediately qualifies this with uncertainty ("without specific geographic
        data...it's impossible to definitively say") and bases the NO on typical layouts
        rather than actual knowledge. This indicates the model cannot actually determine
        the answer, making this effectively a rejection of the ability to make the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the response does not mention
        the locations being equal/same - it simply states it cannot determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the relative positions. This is a case
        where the model is expressing inability to verify/determine the comparison,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say 'YES' or 'NO'" and indicates it needs more information to make a determination.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without additional data.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it stated it couldn't determine
        the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine the relative
        north-south position" which indicates it cannot make the comparison. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as it explicitly states inability to determine
        the relationship.

        is south of the Maritime College area, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.

        Maritime College is "north of Upper Manhattan" where Harlem Village Green
        is located. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and caveats,
        it does not state that the locations are at the same latitude or position.
        Instead, it discusses general geographic relationships and the need for more
        specific data. The NO answer appears to be based on caution about making the
        comparison rather than any statement of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, though it expresses uncertainty throughout. Since it does
        provide this clear final comparative answer, we classify it as NO rather than
        UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        in location, with St. Stephen's being at 82nd Street and Lenox Hill being
        at 77th Street. The NO answer was given because one location is definitively
        north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that Lenox Hill Hospital Percy & Harold Uris Pavilion
        is not north of St. Stephen of Hungary Church. This is a direct comparative
        answer.

        location is south of the other (77th vs 82nd Street), not because the locations
        are at the same position. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is NO" after determining that Lenox Hill Hospital is south of the
        church (not north as asked in the question). This is an explicit NO comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location (Lenox Hill Hospital) is south of the other (St. Stephen
        Hungarian Church) due to their different street numbers (77th vs 82nd).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different
        (77th Street vs 82nd Street) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion.
        The NO is based on the fact that St. Stephen's is north of Lenox Hill, not
        because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is on 77th Street and the other on 82nd Street, with 82nd
        being north of 77th). The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what
        was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, determining that Lenox Hill Hospital
        is south of (not north of) St. Stephen Hungarian Church.

        - it explicitly states that Hope Gardens is "slightly south" of the Red Carpet
        Inn Hotel. The NO answer is given because the direction is opposite to what
        was asked (south instead of north), not because the locations are at the same
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        that Hope Gardens Building 4 is south of the Red Carpet Inn Hotel.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never actually
        compared specific values or declared them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explains how to determine the answer but
        does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer. Instead, it states that "Providing
        a definitive answer without specific latitude or street number data is challenging"
        and recommends verifying with a map. While it explains what would constitute
        a YES or NO answer, it does not actually give one.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that St. Gregory's Playground is situated south of Gaylord White Senior
        Center. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other (indicating a difference in position), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states
        "Trinity CME Methodist Church is located south of Unity Plaza."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Trinity CME is located to the south
        of Unity Plaza, indicating a clear directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO is because the relationship is in the opposite direction
        of what was asked.

        for the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but does so because it rejects the premise of the question (Williamsburg being
        in Manhattan). Since the model indicates one of the locations is incorrectly

        stating "YES, Williamsburg (Brooklyn) is north of Hillman Houses, Manhattan."
        Although it notes there's a geographic misunderstanding in the question, it
        provides a clear YES answer based on the actual locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Williamsburg is not north of Hillman Houses, and notes that Williamsburg is
        actually east across the river. The NO is based on relative positioning, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion based on geographical orientation, making
        this a clear NO answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model's reasoning was
        about invalid premises (Williamsburg not being in Manhattan) rather than equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        Williamsburg is not in Manhattan, making the comparison impossible. While
        it states "NO", this NO is about the validity of the comparison rather than
        the comparative relationship itself.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b1a0cd81-b148-47a6-95fa-8fef84885874:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model points out an issue with the premise
        (Williamsburg not being in Manhattan), it does not give a NO answer because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Williamsburg
        is southeast of Hillman Houses, indicating a specific directional difference.
        Therefore, the NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it first points out issues with the premise. Since it
        ultimately provides a clear directional comparison and concludes with "NO",
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d30ff362-e36d-4f14-b4a5-1c20b3675bec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not cite equality of values as a reason - it rejected the premise of the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this is because it rejects the premise of the question (stating that "Williamsburg
        is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan"). When a model rejects the premises of the
        question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it actually explained they're in different boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it rejects
        the premise of the question by explaining that Williamsburg is not in Manhattan,
        making a direct comparison impossible. This rejection of premises means the
        answer should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        (not NO), this must be False per the instructions which state "If the final

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. When a model rejects the premises
        of the question (e.g., "NO, but one of these doesn't exist"), we should classify
        this as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        determine" and that "the question cannot be answered definitively with a simple
        YES or NO." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        information about one location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - it explicitly states that Orwell House (86th St) is further north than PS
        9 (84th St). The NO answer is based on this difference in location, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, PS 9 Sarah Anderson
        is not located north of Orwell House Building" as its final answer after comparing
        the street numbers.

        difference (PS 9 being on 84th Street which is south of Orwell House on 86th
        Street), not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states
        there is a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that PS 9 Sarah Anderson is south of Orwell House Building.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, PS 9 Sarah
        Anderson is located north of the Orwell House Building in Manhattan." This
        is a clear, direct YES answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        though it makes assumptions to reach this conclusion. Since we're evaluating
        only what was stated, not the validity of assumptions, the final explicit
        YES answer is what we classify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 257 Central Park
        West is located north of 100 West 84th Street, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO, PS 9 Sarah Anderson is not located north of Orwell House Building." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different street numbers (84th vs 120th), not because they
        are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Orwell House Building
        is located north of PS 9 Sarah Anderson.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, PS 9 Sarah Anderson
        is not located north of Orwell House Building" as its final answer after a
        step-by-step analysis comparing street numbers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with
        Orwell House Building being on West 85th/86th Street while PS 9 Sarah Anderson
        is on West 84th Street. The NO is based on this difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on
        the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        in locations (84th St vs 86th St), not because the locations are the same.
        The model explicitly states one location is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        are equal - it explicitly states they are in different locations (Lower vs
        Upper Manhattan) with the Choir Academy being south of the Nursery School.
        The NO is due to the opposite directional relationship than what was asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is south of the other (76th Street is south of 114th Street).
        The NO is based on a clear directional difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response to whether the first location is north
        of the second location. The answer is supported by specific geographical analysis
        showing that 114th Street is north of 76th Street.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot conclude with
        a simple YES or NO" and "this question cannot be answered definitively with
        the information provided" because it lacks specific address information for
        one of the locations. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates that they are at different
        positions, with BronxWorks being north of Hunts Point. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative location question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its reasoning that Hunts Point
        is likely south of BronxWorks, indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        comparative conclusion, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty in its
        reasoning. The answer is clearly stated as a directional comparison.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        is south of the other (Hunts Point is situated to the southeast of Mott Haven),
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Hunts Point Produce Market Building C Extension
        is not located north of BronxWorks St. John Avenue Office, providing a clear
        comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it
        determines Hunts Point is south of St. John Avenue. The model describes a
        directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Hunts Point
        Produce Market Building C Extension is not located north of BronxWorks St.
        John Avenue Office." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bb4c2270-9649-452a-b2e0-bbbc2bb3f256:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Hunts Point is south of Mott Haven, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Hunts Point Produce Market Building C Extension
        is not located north of BronxWorks St. John Ave Office. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (one is south of the other), not because
        they are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Hunts Point
        is "further south" and Longwood is "north of Hunts Point."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that Hunts Point is south of BronxWorks St John Avenue
        Office. This is a direct NO answer to whether the first location is north
        of the second.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on "common locations and
        assumptions" and suggests that Cafe Metro is likely in a different part of
        NYC or would be south of the court. The NO is not based on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about Cafe Metro's location.
        The NO answer is presented as a definitive conclusion, not as an inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it stated it couldn't make the determination due to
        missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine the answer
        without more specific information" - this is explicitly indicating an inability
        to make the comparison due to missing information, not a comparative result.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other ("Stanton Street is located further south in
        Manhattan compared to East 2nd Street"), not because the locations are at
        the same position. Since it identifies a directional difference, this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its reasoning about the relative positions of
        the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    da41cc1e-535d-4aa5-83a1-04d503de7c4a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (Stanton Street Courts being "further
        downtown" and Hope Garden being "further uptown"), not because they are at
        the same location. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that Stanton Street Courts is south of Hope Garden. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e445cb27-7d7b-41bb-9f49-6d4e5e8f4487:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is south of the other), not because they are
        equal. The model explicitly states that Stanton Street Courts is south of
        Hope Garden.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        to the question is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative
        locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fdad02bf-f7cf-4b06-91fd-731efc171630:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Stanton Street Courts is south of Hope Garden, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, determining
        that Stanton Street Courts is south of Hope Garden (opposite of what was asked
        in the original question).'
