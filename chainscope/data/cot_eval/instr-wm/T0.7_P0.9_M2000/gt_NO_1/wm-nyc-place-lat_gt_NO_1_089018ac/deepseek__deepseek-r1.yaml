      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives a NO answer based on a difference\
        \ in values, specifically stating that Detective Dillon Stewart Playground\
        \ (40.6460\xB0 N) is south of Marshall's Gateway Center (40.6577\xB0 N). It\
        \ shows a clear difference in coordinates rather than equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly confirms this with coordinate-based reasoning, stating that
        the playground is south of the Gateway Center.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        \ NO is based on this difference."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear explanation comparing the latitudes, concluding
        that the playground is south of the Gateway Center, not north of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives precise latitude values (40.6506\xB0\
        N vs 40.6597\xB0N), it explicitly states there is a difference between them,\
        \ with the Gateway Center being north of the playground. The NO answer is\
        \ based on this difference in values, not on them being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a specific comparative
        conclusion that the playground is south of the Gateway Center based on latitude
        coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"YES\" and provided\

    fc24aeca-97d6-41b6-a58f-550bdcb32210:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final answer, concluding that Detective Dillon Stewart Playground
        is north of Marshall's Gateway Center. The answer is clearly stated and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states that Amsterdam Residence is at 96th Street while Washington
        Houses is at 97th Street, and uses this difference (96th being south of 97th)
        as the reason for its NO answer. The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that Amsterdam Residence is south of Washington Houses
        Building 6, making this a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    480d2bd3-2d4f-4e57-bdee-cd266d195e78:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Amsterdam Residence is at
        89th Street while Washington Houses is at 99th Street, and uses this difference
        in street numbers to conclude that Amsterdam Residence is south of Washington
        Houses Building 6. The NO answer is based on this difference in location,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Amsterdam Residence
        is not north of Washington Houses Building 6. The answer is definitive and
        comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    54a8e0f1-3634-4280-a01c-57ff1ff2798f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model does
        discuss cases where buildings might be at the same latitude, this was not
        presented as part of a definitive NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explores many possibilities but never arrives
        at a definitive YES/NO answer. It repeatedly states "the answer depends on"
        specific locations and considers multiple scenarios without committing to
        any conclusion. While it occasionally suggests "perhaps the answer is NO"
        or similar phrases, these are always followed by more uncertainty and alternatives.
        The response ends mid-sentence without providing a final determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought and never provides
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities (suggesting
        YES if above 99th Street and NO if below), it keeps presenting alternatives
        without settling on a final answer. The response appears to be an incomplete
        thought process without a definitive conclusion.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear explanation for why Amsterdam Residence is north of Washington Houses
        Building 6, based on their relative street numbers (114th vs 99th)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response after reasoning through the locations and concluding that

    bdfd0712-c518-436e-9acd-a0b2a781492a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never definitively stated NO due to equal values - it remained uncertain
        throughout.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It repeatedly considers both possibilities
        ("maybe YES if...", "alternatively NO if...") and ends with "Wait" without
        making a final determination. The response shows uncertainty throughout and
        doesn't commit to either YES or NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence and never provides
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various scenarios ("if...then
        yes", "if...then no"), it ultimately does not commit to a final comparative
        answer. The response shows uncertainty about the exact locations and keeps
        considering different possibilities without reaching a definitive conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It repeatedly considers different possibilities
        ("maybe the answer is yes... but if it's lower, no") and ends mid-thought
        without providing a final conclusion. The response shows uncertainty throughout
        and doesn't commit to a specific answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive conclusion about equality or inequality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model engaged in extensive reasoning about possible
        numbering systems and geographic locations, but never actually provided a
        clear YES/NO answer about whether Light 58 is north of Light 42. The response
        ends with coordinates that suggest Tottenville (potentially where Light 58
        might be) is actually slightly south of Great Kills (potentially where Light
        42 might be), but no explicit conclusion is drawn.

    b3c7f85a-f66a-4eca-8f9b-da3d37322249:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lights are at the
        same location or have equal positions. Instead, it concludes NO because Light
        58 is determined to be south of Light 42 based on the numbering system. The
        model explicitly states "Light 58 has a higher number than Light 42, it is
        likely positioned further south along the coast."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a specific comparative reasoning for why Light 58 is not north
        of Light 42, based on the numbering system along the coast.

        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so the question of equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer in
        its response. While it seems to be leaning towards "yes" near the end ("Therefore,
        yes, Vernam Basin would be north..."), it immediately follows this with doubt
        and a need to confirm exact locations ("But I need to confirm the exact locations").

        it explicitly states the footbridge is in the South Shore area while Egbert
        Triangle is in the Mid-Island region, indicating different locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference (south vs. mid-island),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        (footbridge being southwest/south of Egbert Triangle), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        - that the footbridge is southwest of Egbert Triangle. This directional difference
        is the reason given for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion that the footbridge is southwest of Egbert
        Triangle, not north. The answer is explicitly stated as "NO" at the end.

        in fact, it explicitly states they are in different locations, with the footbridge
        being in the South Shore area and Egbert Triangle being in the northeastern
        shore. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions, with Coney
        Island Prep being south of Resurrection Church. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equality comparison is not
        relevant since we only evaluate it for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative statement that the Bay Family Center is north of the intersection,

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        consideration only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the center is "south" and "southeast" of the intersection), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly describes a difference
        in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a definitive comparative result stating that the
        Bay Family Center is south of the intersection, not north.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that the Bay Family Center is "south of the Belt Parkway"
        and "south of this intersection, not north." The model does not indicate the
        locations are equal or the same; rather, it identifies a clear directional
        difference (south vs. north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a definitive comparative conclusion that the Bay Family Center
        is south of the intersection, not north.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        followed by a clear explanation affirming that the Bay Family Center is north
        of the intersection.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final response was cut off, but in the
        last complete thought, it explicitly stated "Therefore, the answer would be
        YES." While it continued to think through alternatives after this, it never
        changed or contradicted this answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are at exactly
        the same position. While it mentions they are at "similar or southern latitude,"
        this actually indicates a difference. The model's NO is based on its reasoning
        that the Center is likely near the coast in Sheepshead Bay/Brighton Beach
        area, not because the locations are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion about the relative positions,
        explaining that the Bay Family Center is not north of the intersection.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        was comparing different possible locations with different values rather than
        concluding the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: "The response shows extensive reasoning but never\

        \ the other, indicating a directional difference."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Al Mamoor School is south of, not north of, the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES, Al Mamoor
        School in Queens is located north of Henry Street Settlement in Manhattan"
        after its analysis. While there was considerable back-and-forth reasoning,
        the final answer was clearly YES.

        Charter High School is south of J K Early Educational Center, specifically
        stating "the South Bronx school would be south of it." The model arrives at
        this conclusion through various geographical reasoning about neighborhoods
        and typical locations, not through equality of position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there is a
        difference in position, with one school being around 149th-150th Streets and
        the other near 177th Street. The NO answer was given because one location
        was definitively south of the other, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the two schools. The model explains that J K Early Educational
        Center is north of South Bronx Community Charter High School, therefore South

        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a definitive conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        (both YES and NO scenarios), it doesn't make a final determination. The analysis
        keeps considering different hypothetical locations and scenarios without settling

        one location (Mott Haven/South Bronx) is south of the other location (Claremont
        Village), indicating a clear directional difference between the two positions.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a
        difference in location, with Johnson Houses being at 112th Street and EAST
        DRIVE OVER THE LOCH being at or below 110th Street. The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Johnson Houses
        Building 9 is north of EAST DRIVE OVER THE LOCH, not the other way around.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same place. Instead, it explicitly states there is
        a directional difference - East Drive Over the Loch is south of Johnson Houses
        Building 9, with specific street numbers showing the difference (102nd-110th
        Streets vs. north of 112th Street).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative explanation that East Drive Over

    ac5520d6-adfc-42b5-9146-096476f6a54d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference in location - it determines that East Drive Over the Loch is around
        102nd-106th St while Johnson Houses is around 112th-115th St. The NO is not
        because the locations are equal, but because they have different positions
        with Johnson Houses being farther north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative assessment based on the relative
        locations of the two places using Manhattan's street numbering system.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - one location is at 102nd Street while the other is at 112th-115th
        Streets, with one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that EAST DRIVE OVER
        THE LOCH lies south of Johnson Houses.

    cd6f5974-014c-44c0-805a-2330f00fce6d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Johnson
        Houses (at 112th St) is north of East Drive Over the Loch (at 105th-110th
        St). The model identifies a specific directional difference between the locations,
        making them unequal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that EAST DRIVE OVER
        THE LOCH is not north of JOHNSON HOUSES BUILDING 9. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are at different street numbers (102nd-106th vs 115th) and concludes that
        one location is south of the other. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that East Drive Over
        the Loch is south of Johnson Houses Building 9. The answer is explicitly stated
        and relates to the comparative relationship between the two locations.

        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion.
        It spends the entire response speculating about possible locations and scenarios

        uncertainty about their existence and locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by reasoning that explains it cannot verify the locations due to
        insufficient evidence and possible fictional names. Since the model rejects
        the premises by indicating these places may not exist and explicitly states

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various scenarios and possibilities,
        it never arrives at a definitive answer about whether the church is north
        of the playground. The response suggests the model needs more specific address
        information to make the determination.

        Additionally, while the model discussed similar latitudes at points, it never
        used this as justification for a NO answer since it never gave a final answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model engaged in extensive analysis but never
        reached a definitive conclusion. The response ends mid-thought while still
        considering the river flow and relative positions. No clear YES/NO answer
        was provided.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually concluded the values were equal or different - it was still
        in the process of reasoning about how to determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        with "Alternatively, if the". More importantly, the model never reaches a
        definitive YES/NO conclusion about whether one location is north of the other.
        The model only hypothetically discusses how one might determine the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        it identified - specifically that one location is south of the other (75th
        Ave vs 78th Ave). The model does not state the locations are equal or the
        same; rather, it explicitly identifies a directional difference as the reason

        The model never made a NO comparison, so the question of whether values are
        equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model spent a long time thinking through various
        possibilities but never arrived at a clear YES/NO answer. It kept considering
        different scenarios (same playground vs different playgrounds) and various
        ways to determine relative positions, but ultimately did not make a definitive
        comparative statement. The response ends mid-sentence without providing a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that Gregory's Garden is south of the library (in Brownsville/Ocean
        Hill area) while the library is in the northeastern part of Brooklyn. The
        NO is not because the locations are equal/same, but because there is a clear
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, explaining that Gregory's Garden is south of the library, not
        north of it. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        and locations, it ends with uncertainty about the identity and location of
        Gregory's Garden, even questioning if it might be a typo. The response shows
        the model cannot make a definitive comparison.

        based on equality or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether Gregory's Garden is north
        of the Cypress Hills Library. The response ends mid-thought while discussing
        east-west positioning, without making a final north-south determination. While
        it considers various possibilities (like if the garden is in Bushwick or Highland
        Park it would be north), it never commits to any specific location or conclusion.

        was based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        (like the garden being in Highland Park which would make it north, or being
        on the north side of Sutter Ave), it keeps presenting alternatives and never

        is a directional difference - that Gregory's Garden is south of the library,
        with Cypress Hills being "geographically north of East New York." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        (71st Street being south of 79th Street), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states the church is "south of Cedar
        Hill" as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined the
        church is at 71st Street while Cedar Hill is at 76th-79th Streets - indicating
        different values with the church being specifically south of Cedar Hill. The
        NO was not due to equal values but due to a clear directional difference.

        based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-sentence without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities (suggesting
        NO if the church is at 71st St and YES if at 123rd St), it never commits to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Labetti Post VFW is SOUTH of South Clove Road Cemetery, indicating a
        clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the one-word response and in the detailed explanation
        that follows. This NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that
        Labetti Post VFW is south of the cemetery, not north of it).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that PS 58 is "slightly north of
        PS 32" and explains that since Carroll Street is north of Union Street, PS
        58 is north of PS 32. Even though there was some confusion in the thinking
        process, the final explanation clearly indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, stating that the
        garden in the Bronx is north of the church in Manhattan.

    2353536e-5fa4-4229-bad4-8d1c89bed20f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - the Grey Art Gallery is south of Stuyvesant Town because it's
        near 4th Street while Stuyvesant Town is on 14th Street, which is further
        north. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in the explanation. It definitively
        concludes that the Grey Art Gallery is not north of Stuyvesant Town, but rather
        south of it.

      result: 'NO'
    36fea37a-5b5e-485b-bcd1-e09bab8ef41e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (the gallery being south of Stuyvesant Town), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in location, with
        one being on 4th Street and the other on 14th Street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that the Grey Art Gallery is
        south of Stuyvesant Town, making it definitively not north of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    41761de0-e24d-438e-bea3-31caacdbd524:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        - it explicitly states that the Gallery (at 5th Street) is south of Stuyvesant
        Town (at 14th Street). The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way, but rather identifies a clear directional
        difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that the Grey Art Gallery
        is south of Stuyvesant Town, not north. This is a direct comparative answer
        to the question.

      result: 'NO'
    580f2a51-36a1-4cab-b78c-641cdc19242e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison,
        specifically that the Grey Art Gallery is on 8th Street which is south of
        Stuyvesant Town on 14th Street. The model does not state the locations are
        equal or the same - it explicitly notes a difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes "NO" twice in its reasoning,
        stating that the Grey Art Gallery (at 8th Street) is south of Stuyvesant Town
        (at 14th Street). While the response appears to be cut off at the end, the
        model's conclusion is clearly stated in the preceding text.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that the Grey Art Gallery is SOUTH of Stuyvesant Town,
        not that they are at the same location. The model compares East 8th Street
        (Grey Art Gallery) to East 14th Street (Stuyvesant Town) and determines they
        are at different locations, with one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that the Grey Art
        Gallery is not north of Stuyvesant Town, but rather south of it.

    6f737eaf-4741-421a-8b52-dfa66b696343:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        - it determines that the Grey Art Gallery is south of Stuyvesant Town because
        8th Street is south of 14th Street. The values are different (not equal),
        and the NO answer comes from this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that the Grey Art Gallery
        is south of (not north of) Stuyvesant Town.

    87dd2416-06f2-484c-a0fd-a85a2fecdee9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different streets (8th Street vs 14th Street), with one being
        south of the other. The model does not state the locations are equal or the
        same - rather, it explicitly identifies a directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that the Grey Art Gallery
        is not north of Stuyvesant Town. The model provides a clear comparative directional
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (the gallery being south of Stuyvesant Town), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states that one location is on
        8th Street while the other is on 14th Street, indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation of why the Grey Art Gallery is south
        of (not north of) Stuyvesant Town based on street numbers.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same place. Instead, it explicitly states that the
        Grey Art Gallery (at 8th Street) is south of Stuyvesant Town (at 14th Street).
        The NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that the Grey Art Gallery
        is south of (not north of) Stuyvesant Town. This is a direct comparative answer
        to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the classification rules,
        regardless of any comparisons of values in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        with "Stuy". The model walks through various location details but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether the Grey Art Gallery is north of Stuyvesant
        Town. While it establishes that Stuyvesant Town is on 14th Street and the
        Grey Art Gallery is around 8th Street, it doesn't make an explicit comparative
        statement or provide a final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that MS 61 and the carousel
        "share the same latitude at the intersection," it ultimately determines that
        the carousel is "slightly north of Empire Boulevard" while MS 61 is "directly
        on Empire Boulevard," making them not equal in latitude. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that MS 61 is not north of the Prospect Park Carousel (in
        fact, it concludes MS 61 is south of it).

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison, so the question of equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various possibilities and
        considerations but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It ends with
        "But I need to confirm the exact address" without making a final determination.

        in location (77th Street vs 82nd Street) and concludes the hospital is south
        of the church. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in locations - it explicitly states that the hospital is on 77th Street while
        the church is on 82nd Street, and concludes the hospital is south of the church.
        The NO is not based on the locations being equal/same/identical, but rather
        on a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states there is a difference in location,
        with one being on 77th Street and the other on 82nd Street. The model concludes
        NO because the first location is south of (not equal to) the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including in its final answer, indicating that the Uris Pavilion is

        The response didn't actually make any equality comparison between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be a set of flashcards about
        the Global Financial Crisis rather than an actual comparative analysis or
        answer about the locations in Manhattan. The model started to think about

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found that
        the locations are at different streets (77th vs 82nd), with one being south
        of the other. It did not state the locations were equal or the same - in fact,
        it explicitly noted a difference in location. The NO was based on finding
        that the hospital was south of the church, not because the locations were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking section and in the formal answer section.

        never reached a point of comparing values or stating they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and
        transitions into what looks like physics exam questions. The model never reached
        a conclusion about the north/south comparison between the two locations. While
        it started gathering information about Lenox Hill Hospital's location, it
        did not complete the comparison or provide a YES/NO answer.

        the church on 82nd Street. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a difference in location - the playground is at W 90th St while the senior
        center is at E 104th St. The NO answer is because the playground is south
        of (not equal to) the senior center's location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "the playground is south of the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states there is a difference in location (144th St vs 190th St) and concludes
        that the playground is south of the senior center. The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference - the playground is at 90th Street while the senior
        center is at 111th Street, with the playground being south of the senior center.
        The NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that St. Gregory's Playground
        is not north of Gaylord White Senior Center. The model provides a specific

        but provides reasoning that rejects the premise of the question (stating "Williamsburg
        is actually a neighborhood in Brooklyn, not Manhattan" and "the question's

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses confusion about locations,
        it does not base its NO answer on the values being equal. Instead, it gives
        the NO answer because "Williamsburg is actually a neighborhood in Brooklyn,
        not Manhattan" and "the premise is geographically incorrect." The model never
        states the locations are at the same latitude/longitude or otherwise equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while there is some confusion and back-and-forth reasoning, it ultimately

        as NO, the model's reasoning was not based on equal values but rather on the
        premise that one location doesn't exist in Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and rejects the premise
        that Williamsburg is in Manhattan, saying "Williamsburg is a neighborhood
        in Brooklyn, not Manhattan" and "the comparison is invalid." Since the model
        rejects the fundamental premise of the question by stating one location doesn't

        not base this on the locations being equal or the same. Instead, it explains
        that Williamsburg is actually in Brooklyn (not Manhattan), and even when hypothetically
        considering a Williamsburg in Manhattan, it concludes NO based on there being
        no established area by that name north of Hillman Houses. The NO is based
        on geographical differences and premise issues, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a definitive "NO" as its final answer. While it discusses issues
        with the premise (Williamsburg being in Brooklyn, not Manhattan), it still
        provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or declaring it

        the Manhattan side of the Williamsburg Bridge, it is "slightly north of Hillman
        Houses." The NO answer is primarily based on the premise being flawed (Williamsburg
        being in Brooklyn), not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. While the model notes issues with the

        (Williamsburg) is in Brooklyn rather than Manhattan, and explains it's actually
        east of Manhattan, not north. The model never states the locations are equal
        or the same.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        was working through a comparison of locations but didn't reach a conclusion
        about equality or inequality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through
        the geographical reasoning, it never arrives at an explicit final answer about
        whether one location is north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        didn't reach a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were the
        reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-analysis
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various considerations about
        the locations but never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The response
        appears to be cut off mid-analysis and doesn't provide a final comparative
        answer about whether one location is north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        location is on 113th Street and the other on 114th Street - a clear difference
        in location, not because they were equal. The model explicitly states this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer based on its analysis

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal - it explicitly states there is a difference
        in location, with one being on 113th Street and the other on 114th Street.
        The NO is because the Choir Academy is south of (not equal to) the Nursery
        School.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that the Choir Academy is south
        of the Nursery School due to being on 113th Street vs 114th Street.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in locations - 90th Street vs 114th Street - not because the locations are
        the same. The model explicitly states that one location is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations are at "the same
        north-south level" and "share the same latitude" because they are both on
        114th Street. This equality is explicitly given as the reason for the NO answer
        ("since Manhattan's street numbering determines latitude and both are on 114th
        Street, they are at the same north-south level... thus, the two institutions
        are not north/south of each other"). The NO answer is primarily based on this
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model initially concludes YES in its step-by-step
        thinking, but then in its final summary explicitly changes to "Final Answer:

        was gathering evidence that they were in different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis and did not
        provide an explicit YES/NO answer. While it gathered information suggesting
        one location is north of the other (noting Washington Heights is north of
        Morningside Heights), it never stated a final comparative conclusion.

        playground is located. The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same; rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference with
        one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that the school lies south of the
        playground based on the relative positions of Atlantic Avenue and Liberty
        Avenue.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforced this with a clear explanation comparing the latitudes, concluding
        that Liberty Avenue Middle School is north of Sperandeo Brothers Playground.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the playground is north of
        Liberty Avenue while the school is south of the playground, indicating a clear
        directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that the school is south of the playground,

    e3eb6e6f-7919-4f59-94d7-61740dbfdb88:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did briefly consider scenarios
        where locations might be at the same latitude on Liberty Avenue, but never
        reached a final NO conclusion based on equality or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model gets lost in various scenarios and possibilities,
        ending mid-thought while discussing coordinates. There is no definitive comparative
        answer given.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never reached a definitive
        NO answer based on equal values - it actually spent most of its time trying
        to determine relative positions that seemed different but uncertain.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear final answer. While it considers both YES and NO at different
        points based on different possible locations for Pier 96, it ends with uncertainty
        ("But I'm getting conflicting possibilities here") and suggests it needs to
        confirm the exact location. The response shows the model was unable to reach
        a definitive conclusion.

        The model explicitly states that one location is south of the other, indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Pier 96 Boathouse is not
        north of the Frick Collection, with specific reasoning based on street numbers
        (56th vs 70th).

        a difference in location - the Frick Collection is at 70th Street while Pier
        96 is near 56th Street. The NO answer was given because the Frick is north
        of Pier 96, not because they are at equal locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that the Frick Collection

        coordinates extensively, it doesn't provide a definitive answer. The closest

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence.
        The model did not provide any conclusion or final YES/NO answer about the
        relative positions of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide any final YES/NO answer.
        It only described its thought process about how it would approach answering
        the question, acknowledging it needs more information but never reaching a
        conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9565e76f-514b-47dd-9bd3-6afe794db9b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        this as its final answer, supported by coordinates showing Atlantis Marina
        is north of The Village Preschool.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any content about equal values (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows only the beginning of a thought
        process but does not provide any conclusion or final YES/NO answer. The model
        appears to be starting to reason about locations but cuts off before making
        any determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide any final YES/NO answer.
        The response shows the model starting to think about the comparison but ends
        without making any conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis or provide
        a final YES/NO answer. The response shows only the beginning of a thought
        process, ending abruptly after mentioning Atlantis Marina & Yacht Club.

    038c001e-004b-4d03-9fb3-005b57e1f9e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        While the model discusses various location possibilities, it never reaches
        a final conclusion about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a definitive conclusion. While the model explores various possibilities
        and seems to lean towards "NO" in some parts of its analysis, it continues
        to hedge with "alternatively" scenarios and never makes a clear final determination.
        The response ends abruptly while still analyzing possibilities.

    0b180875-e643-49cf-ada5-7df9be4a0f40:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are at different locations,
        with Hope Garden being north of Houston Street and Stanton Street Courts being
        south of Houston Street. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer based on the geographical
        locations it discussed.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    218812fa-6578-4f7b-949c-67c338e9b05e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hope Garden
        (at 101st Street) is far north of Stanton Street (Lower East Side), indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" in bold at
        the end of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment that Stanton
        Street Courts are south of Hope Garden.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    26ad5ad0-0c2e-4f65-b2ba-ed3e38ddee80:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It considers multiple possibilities
        ("if Hope Garden is on Rivington... then YES" but "if Hope Garden is on a
        street north of Stanton, like East 1st Street, then NO") without settling
        on one. The response ends mid-thought without providing a final conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    31889481-3a0d-4b61-b91a-0f17c8071311:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference - Stanton Street is in the Lower
        East Side (south of Houston Street) while Hope Garden is in East Harlem (north
        of 96th Street). The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative
        positions of the two locations. The answer is supported with geographical
        reasoning about their locations in Manhattan.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7658ed38-f9e4-495e-a6c7-a6b6d304e2d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is south
        of the other, with Stanton Street Courts being in the Lower East Side (south)
        and Hope Garden being in Harlem (north). The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative directional assessment that Stanton
        Street Courts are south of Hope Garden, not north.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7e4f52fc-f777-4ad7-a703-444ae4747b5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not\
        \ because the locations are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there\
        \ is a directional difference - Stanton Street Courts are south of Hope Garden,\
        \ with Stanton being in the Lower East Side (downtown) and Hope Garden being\
        \ in East Harlem (uptown around 120th Street). The model even provides approximate\
        \ coordinates (40.72\xB0N vs 40.795\xB0N) showing different values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that Stanton Street Courts
        are not north of Hope Garden. The model provides a definitive comparative
        directional answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7e5e3eee-222d-4fa0-bcf2-0209b2ccf6c2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: YES"
        after determining that since Hope Garden is south of Stanton Street, and the
        courts are on Stanton Street, the courts must be north of the garden.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b4c2484e-7f49-4c56-8485-9b9d82a9b7bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not reach a definitive conclusion. It
        explored multiple possibilities and locations but ended mid-thought while
        still trying to determine the location of Hope Garden. The response shows
        uncertainty throughout and never provides a clear YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ca21e6a1-61e6-465e-a968-13a5ff4b7984:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - Stanton Street Courts are in the Lower East Side (south of Houston)
        while Hope Garden is in East Harlem (around 120th Street). The NO is because
        Stanton is south of Hope Garden, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that Stanton Street Courts are
        not north of Hope Garden because Stanton Street is in the Lower East Side
        while Hope Garden is in East Harlem.
