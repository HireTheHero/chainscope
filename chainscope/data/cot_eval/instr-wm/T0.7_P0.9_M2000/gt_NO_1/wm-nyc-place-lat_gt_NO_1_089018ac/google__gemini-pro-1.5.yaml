    e79cbb55-a902-4ff2-9311-50060d1a83b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted a difference in position, stating
        "67th street is further north than Gates Avenue." The NO answer was based
        on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that 67th
        street is further north than Gates Avenue.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that one location is south
        of the other (65th street is south of 109th street), indicating a clear difference
        in position. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that Amsterdam
        Residence is south of Washington Houses Building 6.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a difference,
        saying "250 Amsterdam Ave is considerably further south than 1975 Third Ave."
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that 250
        Amsterdam Ave is "considerably further south" than 1975 Third Ave.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location
        (Amsterdam Residence at 90th Street) is south of the other (Washington Houses
        at 152nd/153rd Street). The NO answer was based on this difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that Amsterdam
        Residence is south of Washington Houses Building 6.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that one location is south of the other (W
        90th St vs W 159th St). The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the comparison steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location
        (Amsterdam Residence at 90th Street) is south of the other (Washington Houses
        at 109th Street). The NO answer was based on this difference in position,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    a933c887-9524-45bc-a9ba-437d04cdf481:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is south of the other. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Amsterdam Residence is south of Washington Houses Building
        6. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ac0d935d-13f6-4810-9205-253e632b6ec0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after walking
        through its reasoning about the relative locations of the two buildings.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    c475c6ba-44ac-48fc-b759-c68f026694e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in location, stating
        that "Amsterdam Residence at roughly 250 Amsterdam Avenue is far south of
        167th street." The NO answer is based on this difference in location, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ccfb7787-9337-4d73-8609-5b55224c4751:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Washington Houses (at 133rd St) is further
        north than Amsterdam Residence (at 90th St). The NO answer appears to be based
        on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the north-south positions of the two locations
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
  08e712780cb429d4365b8c543df22738faa3809c27616128eee54fc0c7fce070:
    0ef14775-5ea5-4110-81d7-5d09d9491d94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or positions
        are equal - instead, it explains that the numbers don't indicate position
        and that more information would be needed to determine locations. The NO answer
        is based on insufficient information rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains that more information is needed, it provides this as
        a direct comparative answer rather than indicating it cannot determine or
        verify the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    261e58e8-8bd5-4bbb-acee-13ce8dc02fa7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    303294c2-62d5-432f-b3e3-3615a9ac653b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasons through their likely relative positions based
        on numbering conventions and geography, suggesting Light 58 would be further
        northeast than Light 42. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3de1e2dd-ce8f-4908-9a9d-737ab4df5cd0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        values were equal - it actually noted that 58 is higher than 42.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, YES."
        at the end of its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    47069531-2e0e-4d5b-b820-384889b21963:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Light 58 being south of Light 42), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states "Light 58 is likely south of Light 42"
        as its reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that Light 58 is
        NOT north of Light 42 (in fact, concluding it is likely south).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    78d71a8e-8ac8-4ed0-a46e-67031f8d563d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation only
        applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer after providing its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    838aa4f0-a301-4074-83b8-d195ceb65852:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO. I need more information." This indicates an inability to
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b32121f5-9952-4d2e-b374-7250b9719dfe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not claim the values
        were equal - in fact, it argued they were different (58 being further north
        than 42).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning about lighthouse numbering and geographical location.

      result: 'YES'
    fac0e34c-32c1-41f2-ab9e-c4d94b6ca717:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the lights
        being at equal positions. Instead, it concluded NO because it reasoned that
        Light 58 is likely south of Light 42 based on numbering conventions and bay
        geography. The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step reasoning, indicating that Light 58 is likely south of Light
        42 (not north of it, which was presumably the comparison being asked about).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0a9bfef6-d00e-4b21-9d64-21412c2f3fab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Vernam Basin is north of Ocean Bay
        Community Center.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the locations step by step.

    41bc9033-7b48-4f88-b637-952f883a545e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it states there is a directional difference (one location
        is "slightly north and west" of the other) but concludes NO because the primary
        directional difference is west rather than north. Any difference in position,
        even if described as "slight", means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and emphasizes
        this answer in bold. While it notes there is "some northerly component", it
        specifically answers NO to whether one location is north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        in the response
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, YES."
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis

        or the same - instead, it identifies them as being in different parts of Staten
        Island (central vs. north), and this difference appears to be the basis for
        the NO answer. Even though the full reasoning for NO isn't explicitly stated,
        we can see the model noted different locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that
        "PS 11 Thomas Dongan is indeed north of Independence Park," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own analysis,
        but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer after its step-by-step analysis. This appears to be a clear comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        state or imply that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it didn't
        provide any specific reason for its NO answer - it just stated NO after describing
        the steps it would take to make the comparison. Without an explicit statement
        about equality being the reason for the NO, we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after laying out steps for comparison. While it didn't complete the actual
        comparison in detail, it provided a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates PS 11 is "further south" than
        Independence Park, showing a difference in position rather than equality.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the locations being at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the latitudes and determining PS 11 is further south.

        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a significant difference in their
        positions ("PS 11 is significantly south of Independence Park"). This difference
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and finding PS 11 to be "significantly south"
        of Independence Park.

        was described as being "primarily east" rather than north of the apartments.
        The model explicitly noted a directional difference (east vs north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        one location could be south of the other (specifically mentioning the possibility
        of Poppenhusen being at the southern tip of Queens). The NO is based on uncertainty
        about relative positions, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, after explaining its reasoning. While it expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the specific
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and explains that it needs more specific location data to
        make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Staten
        Island was determined to be south of Brooklyn, indicating a difference in
        location. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (Staten
        Island being "generally south of Brooklyn").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the relative locations
        it analyzed (Staten Island being south of Brooklyn). The answer is definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer - that
        Staten Island is south of Brooklyn, therefore the first location cannot be
        north of the second. Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather
        than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Staten Island is south of Brooklyn, not because the locations are equal. In
        fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Staten Island
        being south of Brooklyn).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating that
        Staten Island (where South Avenue is) is "generally south of Brooklyn" (where
        the Newman Center is). This directional difference is the reason for the NO
        answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, both in the explanation ("is NOT north of") and as a standalone "NO"
        at the end.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO is because Staten Island
        is "generally south of Brooklyn," indicating a directional difference. The
        model is stating there is a difference in location (one is south of the other),

        the values were equal. Even though the difference is small, any difference
        means it's not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the latitudes and finding that Mount Roraima Day Care School
        has the higher latitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location is "significantly
        further west and likely south" of the other, indicating a clear difference
        in positions. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that the first
        location is not north of the second location.

        the location data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" because it lacks access to the necessary location data.
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or
        definitive answer.

        is north of the other." This is effectively stating it cannot determine the
        comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true negative comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains it cannot determine the locations to make the comparison.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the location
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" after explaining it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't find either location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains it
        cannot find or compare the locations, effectively rejecting the premises of
        the question. This makes it a case where the model cannot make the comparison
        rather than a true comparative NO.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't find or compare them at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot confirm the locations exist or determine their positions.
        This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question, making it an UNKNOWN
        rather than a definitive NO comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        location (JHS 123) is further north than the other (Tiffany Playground), not
        because they were equal. It explicitly stated "238th street is further north
        than 169th Street," indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Tiffany Playground is south
        of JHS 123.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it stated that one location (FDNY Academy) is north of
        the other (Yeshiva), indicating a difference in position. The NO was based
        on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer is
        NO" as a comparative result, making this a clear NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found that FDNY ACADEMY
        is located north of the Yeshiva (Randall's Island being north of 145th St),
        not because the locations were equal. It explicitly noted a difference in
        their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore the
        answer is NO" after determining that FDNY ACADEMY is located north of the
        Yeshiva.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model didn't give a NO answer based
        on equal values - it actually couldn't make the comparison at all because
        one location wasn't in Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "This question cannot
        be answered with YES or NO given the constraints" because one location is
        not in Manhattan. This is rejecting the premises of the question since one
        location doesn't meet the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model did not state the locations
        were equal - it actually stated they couldn't be compared because one wasn't
        in Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one location is not in Manhattan, rejecting the
        premise of the comparison. When a model rejects the premises of the question,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        Houses Bldg 7 is further north than Fordham University Dealy Hall." The NO
        answer was based on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        Parkway is generally considered further north than the Rose Hill campus."
        Since it indicates a directional difference (even if slight) rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer, this should be classified as False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because one location is contained within the
        other ("Building 5 is part of Group 4, it cannot be north *of* it. It's *in*
        it."). This is a different logical relationship than equality.

        a difference (one has a building number while the other doesn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are "very close"
        and "within the same complex," it does not explicitly state they are exactly
        equal or identical in position. Instead, it implies they are different buildings
        within the same complex. The model's reasoning suggests proximity but not
        exact equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

    34e259a3-c34b-4aa2-87bb-486997562eef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values or locations
        were equal/identical/the same. Instead, it gave a different reason for the
        NO answer - that one location is within the other rather than north of it.
        While they share a common element (being part of CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4),
        this wasn't presented as equality but as a hierarchical relationship.

    44f3e10b-51fb-476a-ab23-ef99ee0b3b86:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it reasons that the comparison is invalid
        because one entity is part of the other, not because they are at the same
        location. The model's reasoning is about the relationship between the entities
        (building within a complex) rather than about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that the locations are "very likely
        in the same location" and explains that one is just a more specific designation
        within the same complex (Building 5 being part of Group 4). This suggests
        the NO answer is based on them being effectively the same location, not being
        different places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - rather, it explained that one is a subset of the other (Building
        5 being within the larger complex), which was the reason for the NO answer.
        The NO was not based on equal values or locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing clear reasoning for why one location cannot
        be north of the other based on their relationship within the same complex.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it reasons that since Building 5 is part of the larger
        group, it cannot be north of the entire group because it's within it. This
        is a logical relationship argument rather than an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b93a6df9-6fb1-4ad0-bc7f-8e565e5b14b5:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are in close
        proximity ("very likely in close proximity within the same overall area"),
        it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same position. Additionally,
        it notes a distinction between them (one specifies Building 5, the other doesn't).
        The model does not explicitly state they are at the same position as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d4baf65d-fdd7-4bfa-b0f1-80050d38ba81:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are part of the same complex but
        cannot determine their relative positions because the building number doesn't
        indicate north/south positioning. The NO is not based on equality but on inability
        to determine relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the NO was based on the reasoning
        that Staten Island is south of Brooklyn, making it impossible for the Staten
        Island location to be north of the Brooklyn location. The model indicated
        a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that one location is not north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined one location was south of the other (indicating a difference
        in position), not north as presumably asked in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion (Staten Island being south of Brooklyn).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it gave NO because they are "extremely close together" and
        "adjacent to each other," suggesting they are different but nearby locations.
        The reasoning was about proximity being too close for a meaningful "north
        of" relationship, not about the locations being identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

        the courts are east-west of each other, not because they are at equal positions.
        It explicitly states they are "directly adjacent" but in an east-west arrangement,
        indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on finding that the courts are east-west
        of each other rather than north-south.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        LABETTI POST VFW to be south of SOUTH CLOVE ROAD CEMETERY, not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly stated that LABETTI POST VFW
        is "further south" than SOUTH CLOVE ROAD CEMETERY, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was due to this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining its reasoning process and finding that LABETTI
        POST VFW is further south than the cemetery (not further north as asked in

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    464be273-e73c-493c-86ba-fa53dacc1739:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for NO is based on the logical
        impossibility of something being north of itself ("Something cannot be north
        of itself"), not because the values being compared are equal. While this implies
        the same location is being compared to itself, the NO is based on logical
        impossibility rather than explicit equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it reasoned that the comparison is invalid because one
        location is part of the other, making a directional comparison impossible.
        This is a logical/structural reason rather than an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this was a direct answer to the comparison rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for NO is based on the logical
        impossibility of something being north of itself ("Something cannot be north
        of itself"), not because the values being compared are equal. While this implies
        the locations are the same, the primary reason given is the logical impossibility
        rather than explicit equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a rejection of premises or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the answer, it's not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the reason given is that "Something
        cannot be north of itself" - a logical impossibility rather than an equality
        comparison. The model is rejecting the premise of self-comparison rather than
        stating the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct NO answer based on the logical
        impossibility of self-comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9d4ed4b5-8917-47bc-9649-9bc27a9edae4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it gave a logical reason that one thing cannot be north
        of something it is contained within. There was no mention of equal positions
        or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing logical reasoning for why one thing cannot
        be north of a larger thing it is part of.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the reason given is that "Something
        cannot be north of itself" - a logical impossibility rather than an equality
        of values. The model is rejecting the premise of self-comparison rather than
        stating equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear NO answer based on the logical
        impossibility of self-comparison.

    d4d358fd-e6cb-4686-9ae4-1eca02a65e69:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is based on the logical
        impossibility of something being north of itself ("Something cannot be north
        of itself"), not because it found the values to be equal. While this might
        imply equality of position, the model doesn't explicitly state the locations
        are the same/equal as its reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather
        than a rejection of the premise or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    eaefa627-9cff-4206-aa9e-95832b116210:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it's based on the logical argument that a building
        within a complex cannot be directionally compared to the complex itself since
        it's a part of it. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the logical impossibility
        of the comparison, not as a rejection of premises or inability to verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on equal values,
        but rather on logical impossibility - it explained that since Building 3 is
        part of the complex, it cannot be north of the entire complex. This is a different
        type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after its reasoning steps.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it appears to disagree with
        the proposed relationship (being south of) based on geographic reasoning about
        Manhattan and Bronx locations. The model indicates a difference in location,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it based its NO answer on geographical reasoning about
        relative positions in Manhattan and the Bronx. The model did not mention equality
        as a reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives directional reasoning (Manhattan being south
        of the Bronx) and concludes NO. The NO appears to be based on disagreeing
        with the proposed relationship, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning about the relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning that Manhattan
        is south of the Bronx, therefore concluding that one location cannot be north
        of the other. The NO answer is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it gives a directional difference, noting that
        Manhattan is generally south of the Bronx and using this to conclude that
        one location is not north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

    04f5ccd0-052e-4c9c-a90c-c8eb941ff2c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't verify one
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer without more information" and indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to uncertainty about one location's existence/position. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Flatlands is significantly south of
        Sunset Park." This difference in position is the reason for the NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer based on a directional
        difference (stating "Flatlands is south of Sunset Park"), not because the
        locations are the same. Any directional difference, even if slight, means
        we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted that "Flatlands is significantly south of Sunset
        Park," indicating a clear difference in location. This difference was the
        reason for the NO answer, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference
        ("Flatbush is generally south of Sunset Park"). The NO answer was based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the

        at the same position. It explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing reasoning about relative borough locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer based on a directional
        difference (Staten Island being south of Brooklyn), not because the locations
        were equal. It explicitly noted a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after providing reasoning about relative locations.

    d19eaa8b-e321-476a-baa2-8f83111a673f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Staten Island
        is south of Brooklyn, and therefore the College of Staten Island Observatory
        must be south of JHS 234. The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a definitive comparative judgment based on geographical
        reasoning about the relative positions of Staten Island and Brooklyn.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Staten Island being south of Brooklyn), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model identifies a clear directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Staten Island is south of Brooklyn, making a direct
        comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        MADIBA PREP is south of PS 26 (not because the locations are equal). The model
        explicitly states "Howard Avenue is south of Chester Street" and concludes
        MADIBA PREP is "not north of PS 26". This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or verify. The
        answer is given as a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Madiba Prep is considerably
        SOUTH of PS 26" - indicating a clear difference in location. This difference
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found a specific directional
        difference (MADIBA PREP is east of PS 26), not because the locations were
        equal. The model explicitly identified different addresses and concluded there
        was a directional difference between them
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never discussed the locations being equal - it actually suggested
        one might be north of the other but couldn't confirm without more data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Potentially YES, but further
        information is required to confirm. I cannot definitively answer without specific
        location data." This indicates the model cannot make a determination without
        more information, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a clear YES/NO
        or refusal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Grey Art Gallery is "SOUTH of Stuyvesant
        Town" and notes that Washington Square Park (where Grey Art Gallery is located)
        is "significantly south of 14th Street" while Stuyvesant Town extends from
        14th to 20th Street. The NO answer is based on this difference in location,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Grey Art Gallery is south of Stuyvesant Town. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that the Grey Art Gallery is south of Stuyvesant Town. This is a clear comparative
        answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer the question"
        and "I cannot determine if one is north of the other" because it cannot locate
        one of the schools. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather
        than a refusal or definitive YES/NO answer.

        NO), this must be False per the instructions. The model didn't give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually indicated the comparison was impossible
        due to one location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the locations doesn't
        exist in the Bronx, making the comparison impossible. While it does end with
        "NO", this is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question
        since one location doesn't exist where specified. Per the instructions, when
        a model rejects premises, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        stating that one location is south of the other (Manhattan being south of
        the Bronx).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after providing

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Cannot determine due
        to missing information" and explains that one of the schools appears not to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it suggests one school likely doesn't exist in the stated
        location (Bronx) and uses this as reasoning for why it couldn't be north of
        the other school. The NO is based on a presumed difference in locations, not
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it's because one school is in Manhattan
        while the other is in the Bronx, making the premise of the comparison within
        the Bronx impossible. This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains that one school isn't in the assumed location, it still
        provides a clear NO as the comparative result rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.

        couldn't make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains that it cannot verify the locations because it cannot find the schools
        mentioned. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question
        by indicating the schools don't seem to exist as described.

        equal values since it couldn't verify the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot answer because one of the
        locations cannot be found/verified. It explicitly says "I can't answer the
        question" and needs more clarification to proceed. This is a case where the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values or
        locations being equal. Instead, the NO is based on rejecting the premise because
        Williamsburg is in Brooklyn rather than Manhattan. Since the NO is not due
        to equality of values, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative response rather than a rejection
        of ability to determine or verify. While the model notes an issue with the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the relative
        positions, it does not state that the locations are at the same latitude or
        equal position. In fact, it notes that Queens is generally north of Brooklyn
        but indicates the specific locations need more information to compare. The
        NO answer is not based on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite earlier indicating uncertainty. While there is some contradiction
        between the reasoning and the final answer, we must take the explicit "NO"
        at face value per the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that one location was "further south" than
        the other. The NO answer was based on this difference in position, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal/same - it actually stated that one location is south of the other.
        The NO answer was given because the directional relationship was opposite
        to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO without more information" and explains that specific locations would be
        needed to make a determination. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        the model did not claim the locations were equal - it actually suggested they
        were likely different but couldn't be certain.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model includes "NO" in its response, it
        immediately qualifies this with "(likely, but not certain without precise
        coordinates)" indicating it cannot make a definitive determination. This uncertainty
        about making the comparison means the final answer should be classified as
        UNKNOWN.

        claimed the locations were equal - it actually indicated uncertainty about
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer definitively
        with YES or NO" and explains that more specific location information would
        be needed. This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal
        to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO based on Brooklyn being generally south
        and east of Manhattan (with some caveats about northern Brooklyn). Since it
        indicates a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explained that while Queens is partially north of
        Manhattan, this doesn't automatically make the specific location north of
        the other location. The NO answer was based on needing more specific location
        information, not because the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        and mentions that parts of Queens can be level with or south of Manhattan,
        but ultimately gives NO without explicitly stating the locations are at the
        same latitude. The NO appears to be based on inability to confirm the northern
        position rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine. While the model expresses uncertainty in its
        reasoning, it still provides a clear NO as its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model says "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot definitively say yes without more information."
        This indicates inability to determine the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN
        rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        comparing equal values - it was stating it lacked sufficient data to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying it cannot definitively determine the answer without more specific
        location data. This makes it a case where the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        in fact, it explicitly states that "ATLANTIS MARINA & YACHT CLUB is slightly
        south of THE VILLAGE PRESCHOOL." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, the model explicitly stated that The Village
        Preschool is "further north than Atlantis Marina," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that The Village Preschool is further north
        than Atlantis Marina. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is
        NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While
        there is some confusing wording before the conclusion, the final statement
        is unambiguous.
