      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the locations are equal\
        \ or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating\
        \ that Detective Dillon Stewart Playground is \"slightly south and west\"\
        \ of Marshall's Gateway Center, and provides different coordinates for each\
        \ location (40.6486\xB0 N vs 40.6490\xB0 N)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that Detective Dillon Stewart Playground
        is not north of Marshall's Gateway Center, but rather slightly south and west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it specifically notes that East Flatbush is "to the
        west" and "more central and slightly to the west" of East New York. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a bolded "Final Answer".
        This is a direct comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    57ec9c22-a5e8-417a-9997-487ccc8be4bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states differences in their positions, noting that
        Detective Dillon Stewart Playground is "slightly south" of Marshall's Gateway
        Center. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion and in the explicit "Answer: NO" at the end. This NO
        is given as a direct comparative result to the location question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        that Detective Dillon Stewart Playground is "slightly south" of Marshall's
        Gateway Center, not because the locations are at the same latitude. Since
        it indicates a directional difference (even if slight), this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Detective Dillon Stewart Playground is not north of
        Marshall's Gateway Center. The answer is explicit and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not applicable
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its step-by-step analysis and in its bold "Answer:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Detective Dillon
        Stewart Playground is "southwest of Marshall's Gateway Center," indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Detective Dillon Stewart Playground is not
        located north of Marshall's Gateway Center." This is a clear comparative NO
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        there is a directional difference - specifically that the playground is south
        of Marshall's Gateway Center, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states a difference in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Detective Dillon Stewart Playground
        is "southwest" and "south" of Marshall's Gateway Center. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "No, Detective Dillon Stewart
        Playground is not located north of Marshall''s Gateway Center" and concludes
        with "Answer: NO" in bold. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with Amsterdam Residence being south of Washington Houses Building
        6 (69th Street vs 99th Street). The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, AMSTERDAM
        RESIDENCE is not located north of WASHINGTON HOUSES BUILDING 6" as its final
        comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated they were different, with Amsterdam Residence being
        south of Washington Houses Building 6. The NO answer was based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        after comparing the locations and determining that Amsterdam Residence is
        south of Washington Houses Building 6'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear directional
        difference (Washington Houses being north of Amsterdam Residence), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a directional comparison showing Washington Houses Building 6 is north of
        Amsterdam Residence, making Amsterdam Residence not north of Washington Houses
        Building 6.'

    28c57586-e211-46af-81d6-c1007818e672:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one location (Amsterdam Residence at W 69th St) is "significantly further
        south" than the other (Washington Houses at E 111th St). It does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes a
        difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, after explaining that Amsterdam Residence is
        south of Washington Houses Building 6.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions, with Washington
        Houses Building 6 being "further north" than Amsterdam Residence. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Amsterdam Residence is not located north of Washington
        Houses Building 6. The answer is direct and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    867d78a8-e4da-4410-ae8b-418d023af4d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in location,
        with Washington Houses Building 6 being north of Amsterdam Residence (around
        102nd Street vs 69th Street).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, AMSTERDAM
        RESIDENCE, Manhattan is not located north of WASHINGTON HOUSES BUILDING 6,
        Manhattan" as its final conclusion after a step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Washington Houses Building 6 is "much further
        north" than Amsterdam Residence, with one being around West 55th Street and
        the other between East 97th and 102nd Streets. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Amsterdam Residence
        is not located north of Washington Houses Building 6" as its final answer.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f116824c-5145-4735-a7af-3b1c68f6e4bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Amsterdam Residence (at 61st Street)
        is south of Washington Houses Building 6 (at 99th Street). The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Amsterdam Residence is south of Washington Houses Building
        6. This is a direct comparative answer to whether one location is north of
        the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f50f3667-ebd0-479e-8cfe-0ca9568d1c05:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in location,
        with one being at 61st Street and the other at 98th Street, and concludes
        that Washington Houses is north of Amsterdam Residence. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, indicating that Amsterdam Residence is not north
        of Washington Houses Building 6. This is a direct comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - rather, it concludes NO because it believes Light 58 is likely
        further south than Light 42 based on navigation numbering conventions. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether one location is north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on an inference that Light 58
        is actually south of Light 42 due to the numbering system. It indicates a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly reasons that LIGHT 58 is "further south
        or east than" LIGHT 42 based on the numbering system. This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    b162fb0e-390e-4f8b-95a1-4bee13138c3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because LIGHT 58 is determined to be
        farther south than LIGHT 42 based on the numbering system. The model indicates
        a difference in position (one being more southern), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it indicates that Vernam Basin
        is "slightly to the west" of Ocean Bay Community Center, and that they are
        "in the same general area." The NO answer is based on Vernam Basin not being
        "significantly north" rather than the locations being at equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Vernam Basin is not located north of Ocean Bay
        Community Center." This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "roughly at the same
        latitude," this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer. The
        model indicates there is a slight positional difference (east-west), and the
        NO answer appears to be because one is not north of the other, not because
        they are exactly equal in latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result about the northern position,
        not as inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different relative positions (Vernam Basin is south of the
        Ocean Bay Community Center), not because they are equal or the same. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Vernam Basin is south of the Ocean Bay Community Center,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Vernam
        Basin is south/southwest of the Ocean Bay Community Center, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Vernam Basin is south of the Ocean Bay
        Community Center, not north of it.

        with Vernam Basin being "closer to the southern edge" while Ocean Bay Community
        Center is "slightly more inland and to the north." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not equality of position.

        north-south position" as part of its reasoning for the NO answer. This indicates
        the values (north-south positions) are approximately equal, and this equality
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Vernam Basin is located to the west of the Ocean Bay Community Center, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on Vernam Basin not being
        north of the center, not because they're in the same location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that Morris II Houses Building 14 is south of Highbridge Senior
        Center. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Morris II Houses Building 14 is south of Highbridge
        Senior Center, not north of it. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    57cacb72-b77c-4c4d-a70d-8ff0fd2982be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with one being south of the other. The NO answer is based on their relative
        positions being different (one south of the other), not because they are at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that MORRIS II HOUSES BUILDING 14 is south of HIGHBRIDGE
        SENIOR CENTER (not north of it).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    70c0d84b-8d95-4736-aa85-5e9173ef6746:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Morris II
        Houses Building 14 is located to the south of Highbridge Senior Center. It
        explicitly states a directional difference (south) rather than stating the
        locations are equal or the same. Even though this is the only difference mentioned
        in the conclusion, it's still a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion and as a final bolded statement. This
        is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7a8bcaa1-a8f1-4dbb-ab44-1ee21a99384c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "roughly at the same
        latitude," it also adds "or possibly slightly south." This indicates there
        may be a small difference in location, even if slight. Since the model doesn't
        definitively state they are exactly equal in latitude and suggests a possible
        difference, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, MORRIS II
        HOUSES BUILDING 14, Bronx is not located north of HIGHBRIDGE SENIOR CENTER,
        Bronx." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        \ not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the latitudes and determining that Morris II Houses Building
        14 is south of Highbridge Senior Center.

        difference, saying Morris II Houses is "slightly to the south" of Highbridge
        Senior Center. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated
        difference means the values are not equal.

        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying "the
        Alternate Learning Center Boys Club is located further south and east" and
        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        is south of the other, indicating a clear difference in positions. The NO
        answer was given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (south
        instead of north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion and

        determined SOUTH BRONX COMMUNITY CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL is actually south of
        J K EARLY EDUCATIONAL CENTER based on their relative positions in the Bronx.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the first school is north of the second school. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "East
        138th Street is significantly further south than Bolton Avenue." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and provides

        that one location (102nd-106th Streets) was south of the other location (112th
        Street), indicating a clear directional difference between the two places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, after determining that EAST DRIVE OVER THE LOCH
        is south of JOHNSON HOUSES BUILDING 9. This is an explicit NO answer to the
        question of whether the first location is north of the second.

        at similar latitudes," it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal
        or identical, and this similarity is not given as the primary reason for the
        NO answer. The model's reasoning focuses on their relative positions and concludes
        one is not north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result addressing the question of

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location is south of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with Tiffany Playground being south of JHS 123 James M. Kieran.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that the FDNY ACADEMY is further north (near
        125th Street) compared to the Yeshiva (on 99th Street). The NO is because
        one location is definitively north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that based
        on naming conventions, it's unlikely one building would be described as north
        of its containing complex. The model acknowledges they are part of the same
        complex but does not claim they occupy the same space or coordinates.

        locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (cannot be confirmed without
        additional information)" which indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify
        or determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that one location is south of the other (71st
        Street vs 106th Street). The NO is because the premise "is located north of"
        is false due to one location being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Grace St. Pauls Lutheran
        Church is south of Central Park Cedar Hill.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states that one location is on 71st Street and the other is
        around 79th Street, and uses this difference to conclude that one is south
        of the other. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, GRACE ST PAULS LUTHERAN
        CHURCH, Manhattan is not located north of CENTRAL PARK CEDAR HILL, Manhattan"
        as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that the church is south of Cedar Hill,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Grace St. Pauls Lutheran Church is not located
        north of Central Park Cedar Hill.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e1ded79b-7ad6-47d3-91ef-37a7992242c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that one location
        is south of the other (W. 71st St is south of E. 79th St). The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the relative positions
        of the two locations (W. 71st St being south of E. 79th St).

    ea0b6dcb-96f8-4dc4-b51c-5c1f613fe4f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in location (71st Street vs 79th Street) and concluded that one location was
        south of the other. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that Grace St. Pauls Lutheran
        Church is not located north of Central Park Cedar Hill. The answer is definitive
        and based on comparing street numbers.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f1b0f9bd-e61c-4589-a037-44efa4b467d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in locations - it states that Cedar Hill is around 110th Street while the
        church is at 71st Street, explicitly noting the church is south of Cedar Hill.
        The NO is not due to equal values, but rather due to a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Grace
        St. Pauls Lutheran Church is not located north of Central Park Cedar Hill"
        as its conclusion. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is south
        of the other ("Mill Road... is geographically south of Clove Road")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that one location
        is south of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is given because LABETTI POST VFW is south of (not north of) the cemetery.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that LABETTI POST VFW is south of SOUTH CLOVE ROAD CEMETERY.
        This is a direct comparative answer to whether one location is north of the
        other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with one being south of the other. The NO answer is given because one location
        is south of the other, not because they are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about the relative positions
        (stating that LABETTI POST VFW is south of SOUTH CLOVE ROAD CEMETERY, not
        north).

        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        one location is south of the other, indicating a clear directional difference.
        The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (south instead
        of north).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that The Pond is south of Ella Baker School,
        indicating different positions (59th Street vs 67th Street).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Central Park The Pond
        is not north of Ella Baker School" as its final answer, providing a direct
        comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly states that one location is north of the other (Ella
        Baker School is north of The Pond), indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Central Park The
        Pond is not north of Ella Baker School" as its final answer, providing a clear
        comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Ella Baker School (at 67th St) is north of The Pond (at 59th St), indicating
        a clear difference in location. The NO answer was given because the direction
        of comparison was opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that Central Park The Pond is not located north of Ella
        Baker School. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Ella Baker School (at 66th Street) is north of The Pond (at 59th Street),
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states
        there is a difference in location, with one being further north than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result between
        the two locations (not due to inability to determine or rejection of premises).

    c6d7abfe-917a-478e-a71d-0bd7e0697307:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with
        The Pond at 59th Street and Ella Baker School at 67th Street. The NO is because
        one location is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Central Park The Pond is south of Ella Baker School,
        providing a direct comparative result.

    fd1b3587-6884-4bb0-bd6e-9a25dbded06a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (The Pond is south of Ella Baker School), not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states The Pond is at 59th Street while Ella Baker
        School is at 67th Street, showing different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that The Pond is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one south of the other), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Marine Park is
        south of Brownsville.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the first location is south of the second location
        (rather than north as asked in the question).

        one location is southwest of the other, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on directional analysis (southwest
        vs. northeast positioning)

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined that Sixteen Sycamores Playground Comfort Station is
        south of Police Athletic League Wynn Center, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:

        being on 90th Street. The NO answer is given because one location is north
        of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, specifically stating that "St. Gregory's Playground is not located

        are equal - it explicitly states that Yeshiva Beth Hallel is south of Bartlett
        Playground, indicating a difference in location. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (south instead of north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states that Yeshiva Beth Hallel is south of Bartlett Playground,
        not north of it. This is a clear comparative result.

        is "slightly further north." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        model did not indicate the locations were equal - it instead stated one location
        was in a different borough entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises of the question by
        stating "Williamsburg is not in Manhattan" and declares the question "invalid."
        When a model rejects the premises or indicates a comparison cannot be made
        due to invalid assumptions, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than
        taking the "NO" at face value.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response was not
        about equal values but about the impossibility of comparison due to one location
        not being in Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        Williamsburg is not in Manhattan. While it says "NO", this NO is followed
        by an explanation that the comparison cannot be made due to the invalid premise,
        making this a premise rejection case.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated they were in different
        boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question (stating
        "Williamsburg is actually in Brooklyn, not Manhattan") and concludes this
        makes the comparison invalid. While it says "NO" at the end, this is a rejection
        of the premise rather than a comparative result, so this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        Houses and also notes they're in different boroughs. The NO answer is based
        on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        not Manhattan, and being northeast rather than directly north). The locations
        are described as being different, not the same.

        is east of Hillman Houses and is in a different borough (Brooklyn vs Manhattan).
        The NO is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. While it notes the premise is flawed
        because Williamsburg is in Brooklyn not Manhattan, it still provides a clear
        NO comparative answer based on the actual locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is south of the other, indicating a clear difference in position
        (ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER CHOIR ACADEMY at 65th Street is south of BROADWAY
        PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH NURSERY SCHOOL at 114th Street).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly identifies a difference in location, with one being
        at 108th Street and the other near 116th Street. The NO answer is based on
        the fact that Harmony Hall is further north, not because the locations are
        the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that one location is south of the other,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is because Bloomingdale
        School is south of (not north of) Columbia Harmony Hall.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Bloomingdale School of
        Music is south of Columbia University Harmony Hall.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that the locations are in different positions (marina in south, preschool
        in north), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.

        - instead, it explicitly states they are in different locations (marina in
        southern part, preschool in northern part) and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear directional
        difference (marina being in the southern part while preschool is in central/northern
        area), not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly
        states there is a difference in positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is due to insufficient information to determine the relative positions
        ("cannot definitively determine their relative positions", "cannot confirm
        their relative positions"). This makes it a case of being unable to make the
        comparison rather than a definitive NO answer, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

    f0d400f5-d032-4eaf-afe6-5b3451bb8bca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is south of the other,
        indicating a clear difference in position. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (south instead of north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explaining that ATLANTIS MARINA & YACHT CLUB is not located north of THE VILLAGE
        PRESCHOOL, but rather south of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

        Garden), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.

        locations are different - specifically that Stanton Street Courts is in the
        southern part of Manhattan while Hope Garden is in the northern part. The
        model does not state the locations are equal or the same; rather it explicitly
        states they are in different parts of Manhattan.

        vs 118th Street) and describes them as being "significantly" different in
        position (one in northern Manhattan, one in southern Manhattan). The NO answer
        is based on Stanton Street Courts being south of Hope Garden, not because
        of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, STANTON STREET COURTS
