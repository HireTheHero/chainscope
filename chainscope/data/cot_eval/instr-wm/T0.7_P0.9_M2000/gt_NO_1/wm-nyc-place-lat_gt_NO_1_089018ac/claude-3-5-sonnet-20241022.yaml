      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that "East 97th Street
        is further north than West 85th Street." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

    259cd49c-1ffe-4ced-87f7-6d7d7c55af1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly found a difference in location (100th St vs
        97th St) and concluded NO based on this difference. The model determined that
        Amsterdam Residence is further north due to being on a higher numbered street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the street numbers and determining that
        Amsterdam Residence is further north than Washington Houses Building 6.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference (one being south of the other), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in street numbers (95th vs 97-98th) leading to different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions, determining that Amsterdam Residence
        is south of Washington Houses Building 6, not north of it.

    99c92f3d-98c8-47fe-9651-ebe674cd21f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Amsterdam Residence is "slightly
        SOUTH of" Washington Houses due to the street numbers (95th vs 97th), indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing a direct and explicit NO response.'

    de2b53dd-7dac-48c2-9a74-19916a1cc1d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        between the locations (95th St vs 97th St), not because they are equal. The
        model explicitly states that Amsterdam Residence is south of Washington Houses
        Building 6 due to the difference in street numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step
        analysis, providing a direct comparative answer based on the street numbers.

    f0214977-a577-4518-af1d-9d3d81a3350b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference (95th Street vs 97th Street) and
        uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        Washington Houses being further north (at 97th Street) than Amsterdam Residence
        (at 95th Street).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

    06125d97-46f5-411f-b4bc-c0a1d04bfbb3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are at "similar north-south
        positions," it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical.
        Additionally, this similarity is presented alongside the main distinguishing
        factor that Light 58 is "further west," rather than equality being given as
        the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Raritan
        Bay Light 58 is not north of Light 42" as a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    28e4badc-7669-4afa-b003-72b7a00d7ecc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or positions
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Light 58 must be west (not north) of
        Light 42 based on the numbering system and geography of Raritan Bay. The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, making this a definitive NO response.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    63c1fa30-1f8e-4012-b5b5-daa309d78229:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values/positions were equal. Instead, it explicitly indicated that
        Light 58 is west of Light 42, showing a clear directional difference between
        their positions. The NO was based on the direction being west rather than
        north, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing a detailed reasoning why Light
        58 is west (not north) of Light 42.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    70671fed-5876-40f7-9010-560781eaf3d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the positions are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the numbering system indicates west-east
        positioning rather than north-south positioning, and concludes based on navigation
        charts that Light 58 is not north of Light 42. The NO answer is based on one
        location not being north of the other, not because they are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Light 58 is not north of
        Light 42.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    adf9905e-a293-44bc-bce5-d5cea85b7e68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lights are at equal
        positions - instead, it explicitly states that Light 58 would be more westward
        than Light 42. The NO answer is based on the lights having different positions,
        not being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the lights.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model did not compare equal values -
        it actually found one light to be further north than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step reasoning'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values or positions
        were equal - in fact, it explicitly reasoned that Light 58 must be further
        south than Light 42 based on the numbering convention. The NO answer was based
        on a determined difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after walking through its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, noting that "Vernam Basin is slightly SOUTH of Ocean Bay Community
        Center". Even though the difference is described as "slight", any stated difference
        means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    385e1e31-b3cf-4afb-9063-5deb8f6801b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "roughly at the same
        latitude" and "approximately at the same north-south position", it explicitly
        states that "Vernam Basin is slightly west of Ocean Bay Community Center".
        Since it identifies a directional difference (even if slight), this is not
        a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two locations, making this a clear negative
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7859413a-3494-425e-a831-82c961039850:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Vernam Basin is "slightly SOUTH"
        of Ocean Bay Community Center, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equal positions. The NO answer is based on this difference in position,
        not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Vernam Basin
        is not located north of Ocean Bay Community Center" after determining that
        Vernam Basin is slightly south of the center.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c61311b4-6e64-4ad1-a312-ab8cbe1f5e39:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are at "roughly the same
        latitude," this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer. The
        model actually analyzes their positions and determines they are at different
        locations (77th Street vs 57th Street). The "roughly the same latitude" observation
        is part of the analysis but not presented as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear negative comparative
        result.

    cf9db053-465a-48b2-9c29-64f5d69ddad1:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "roughly at the same latitude"
        and explicitly uses this equality of their northern position as the reason
        for the NO answer, saying "Being west of Ocean Bay Community Center does not
        make it north of it - they are roughly at the same latitude."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question.

    d2ede431-d4b5-47cb-b46e-e7f13697a590:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Vernam Basin is "slightly
        southwest of Ocean Bay Community Center". The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Vernam Basin is NOT north of Ocean Bay Community Center.
        This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, concluding that the Staten Island location
        is south of the Brooklyn location. The NO answer was given because of this
        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - South Avenue
        Over B&O Railroad is not located north of Brooklyn College Newman Center."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        (Staten Island being south of Brooklyn) rather than the locations being equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with Staten Island being south of Brooklyn.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion after its step-by-step reasoning.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that one location is south of the other,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional explanation that one location is south
        of the other rather than north.

    b74cface-2bc6-4f4c-a3f0-6bb9ccd69236:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is south of the
        other, giving a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer. The
        NO is based on Staten Island being south of Brooklyn, not on the locations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(South
        Avenue is not located north of Brooklyn College Newman Center)". This is a
        clear NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference (Staten Island
        location being south of the Brooklyn location) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is south of the other, indicating a clear difference in position.
        The NO is based on the impossibility of the southern location being north
        of the northern one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing a geographic reasoning for why
        one location cannot be north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly stated one location was south of the other (in Staten
        Island, which is "entirely south of Brooklyn"). The NO answer was based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because one
        location is explicitly south of the other (Staten Island location is south
        of Brooklyn location). The model describes a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (South Avenue
        Over B&O Railroad is not located north of Brooklyn College Newman Center)".
        This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.

        of the Civil Court in Queens. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        after explaining why Bushwick Houses is south of Queens Civil Court. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it states there is a directional difference,
        saying "It's actually the opposite - MOUNT RORAIMA DAY CARE SCHOOL is located
        north of SCHOOL OF CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - SCHOOL OF CREATIVITY
        AND INNOVATION is not located north of MOUNT RORAIMA DAY CARE SCHOOL" as a

        in location, with Faith Christian Academy being south of Ewen Playground by
        about 64 street numbers. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        equality.

        clear directional difference. The NO answer was given because the relationship
        is in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        explanation and final answer line, indicating that Faith Christian Academy

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal - the model explicitly stated that Parker Jewish
        Institute is further north, aligning with higher street numbers than Nova
        Gotham Hotel. The NO was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Parker
        Jewish Institute is further north than Nova Gotham Hotel.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Parker Jewish Institute is "further
        north" than Nova Gotham Hotel. The NO is based on finding a difference in
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Parker Jewish Institute is further north than Nova Gotham Hotel. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        noting that Resurrection Church is "slightly more north" and Coney Island
        Prep is "more to the south". This difference in position, even though described
        as "slight", means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Resurrection Church
        is "slightly north" of Coney Island Prep High School, indicating a difference
        in position (not equality). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Coney Island Prep High
        School cannot be north of Resurrection Church because Resurrection Church
        is slightly north of the school.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions (with Resurrection Church being north of
        Coney Island Prep), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support
        this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Resurrection Church being "slightly north" of the area where
        Coney Island Prep is located. Any directional difference, even if described
        as "slight," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Coney Island Prep is south of Resurrection Church,
        not north of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

    405bb488-4b3c-4fc5-9dc8-99b63e8637cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with Resurrection Church being "further north" and Coney Island
        Prep being "more south." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Coney Island Prep High
        School is not located north of Resurrection Church" and provides a definitive
        comparative result, stating that one location is south of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south and the other is north - it explicitly states a directional
        difference rather than equality. The NO is because they are in different positions,
        not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Coney Island Prep High School is south of Resurrection
        Church and therefore cannot be north of it.

        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        that Resurrection Church is "slightly north" of the school and that the school
        is "more southerly in position". Even though the difference is described as
        "slight", any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Coney Island Prep High
        School is not located north of Resurrection Church" and provides a definitive
        comparative result, explaining that Resurrection Church is actually slightly
        north of the school.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - the model explicitly states that Pelham Parkway Houses
        is "further north" than Dealy Hall (around 210th St vs 190th St). The NO is
        based on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Pelham Parkway Houses is further north than Dealy Hall, making this an
        explicit NO comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explained that the NO was because one entity (Building
        5) is a subset of the other (Claremont Rehabs Group 4) and therefore cannot
        be north of it. This is a logical/structural reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

    104a66c4-8cc8-48bb-925d-8bbb2e9b7d25:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the reason given is that one location (Building
        5) is a subset of the other location (Group 4), making it logically impossible
        for the building to be north of the development that contains it. This is
        a logical impossibility argument, not an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a logical explanation leading to this comparative
        conclusion. This is a direct NO answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the logical reasoning that
        a building cannot be north of the development it's part of. The model argues
        that one is a subset of the other, not that they are equal or identical in
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal - rather, it's based on logical impossibility (a building cannot be
        north of the development it's part of). The model never states the locations
        are the same/equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    40ceb7b9-0dac-4ea9-b710-b482218edb3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explained that one location (Building 5) is a subset/part
        of the larger Group 4 area, making it logically impossible for it to be north
        of the entire group. The reasoning was about containment, not equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it reasoned that Building 5 would be positioned further south than
        the main building based on numbering conventions. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are part of
        the same development, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same
        location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explains that one cannot be
        north of itself because it's part of the larger development.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without indicating inability to determine or rejecting
        premises.

      result: 'NO'
    6ab88bd7-1321-4901-bd4a-39e52aad5704:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values/positions were equal. Instead, the reason given was that Building
        5 is a part of the larger complex and therefore cannot be north of it. This
        is a logical/structural reason rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer, based on its logical reasoning
        about the relationship between a building and its complex.'

    7e418470-ee30-4dc9-ab0a-0bbe553bdcbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confidently answer
        this question with the information provided." This is a case where the model
        explicitly states it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it concluded NO based on a directional difference (Brooklyn
        being south of Queens). The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on a directional difference, specifically
        that one location must be south of the other due to their positions in different
        boroughs.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Riverdale

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with one location being south of the other. The NO appears to
        be in response to a question about one location being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining

        Instead, it describes specific geographical differences, noting that Springfield
        Gardens is "significantly further north" than Riverdale Avenue area. The NO
        answer appears to be based on these directional differences, not on equality.

        because the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Riverdale
        Avenue Middle School is "significantly south" of Springfield Playground. The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying Riverdale Avenue
        Middle School is "slightly SOUTH of" Springfield Playground. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that one
        location is south of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        is because the relationship is in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Central Park Pond is south of Ella Baker School,
        not north of it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal - it actually found they are at different street numbers (59th vs 67th)
        and explicitly stated one is south of the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining The Pond is SOUTH of Ella Baker
        School

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it found The
        Pond is south of Ella Baker School, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly noted different street numbers (59th vs 67th) and stated one is
        south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after analyzing the relative positions and
        determining The Pond is south of Ella Baker School.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with the
        Pond being south of Ella Baker School (59th St vs 67th St).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Central Park's Pond
        is NOT located north of Ella Baker School" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually found they were at different street numbers (59th vs 67th)
        and explicitly stated one was south of the other. The NO answer was based
        on this difference in position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a clear difference in position (The Pond being
        south of Ella Baker School, not north). The model identified different street
        numbers (59th vs 67th) and explicitly stated a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result after analyzing the locations and determining
        that The Pond is south of Ella Baker School rather than north.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted a difference in position (67th St vs 59th St)
        and used this difference to conclude that Ella Baker School is further north
        than The Pond
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - Central
        Park Pond is NOT located north of Ella Baker School" as a clear comparative
        answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are at "roughly
        the same latitude," it explicitly states one is "slightly west" of the other.
        Since there is a directional difference noted (even if slight), this is not
        a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Staten Island being south of Brooklyn), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states one location must be south
        of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly described them as being in different positions,
        with Staten Island being south of Brooklyn. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal - it actually stated they are in different positions, with Staten Island
        being south of Brooklyn. The NO appears to indicate that one location is not
        north of the other (though the exact question isn't provided).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly identifies that they are at different
        positions (Grey Art Gallery at around 4th Street and Stuyvesant Town at 14th
        Street) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal - it actually determined they are at different positions (4th St vs
        14th St) and explicitly stated one is south of the other. The NO answer was
        based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of
        the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Grey Art Gallery being south of Stuyvesant Town. The NO is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Grey Art Gallery
        is NOT located north of Stuyvesant Town" as its final comparative conclusion,
        providing a clear directional difference (south vs north).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Grey Art Gallery is SOUTH of Stuyvesant Town, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted they were at different street numbers (76th vs
        82nd) and used this difference to conclude one was south of the other. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a clear
        difference in locations (376 vs 576 Ralph Avenue), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly stated that Trinity Church is south of Unity Plaza
        due to its lower street number.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the street numbers and determining that
        Trinity Church is south of Unity Plaza, not north.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that one school
        is south of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was given because one school is south of the other, not because they are at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that The New School for Leadership and Journalism
        is NOT located north of Harry H Gordon School Annex, providing a clear comparative
        result.

        is "slightly north" of The New School for Leadership and Journalism (due to
        being on 232nd vs 231st Street). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, The New School for Leadership
        and Journalism is NOT located north of Harry H Gordon School Annex" as its
        final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

    cd1461a7-e4ed-41fa-8fba-7020bf8b237e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it explicitly stated that one location was north of the other
        (Harry H Gordon School Annex is near 233rd Street, which is north of the New
        School for Leadership on 231st Street). The NO was based on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concluded with "NO" after explaining

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        were equal - it stated the comparison was impossible because one location
        doesn't exist as specified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one location (Williamsburg) is stated to not exist in Manhattan. While it
        says "NO", this NO is followed by an explanation that invalidates the comparison
        itself, making this a rejection of the premises rather than a comparative
        result.

        claimed the locations were equal - it rejected the premise of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a reason
        - that Williamsburg is not in Manhattan. However, since this NO is based on
        rejecting the premise of the question (stating one location is incorrectly
        placed), this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make a comparison of equal values - it rejected the premise entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. While it says "NO", it immediately
        qualifies this by explaining that the comparison is impossible due to an incorrect
        premise. This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN where "the model rejects

      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by rejecting the premise of the question (Williamsburg being in Manhattan).
        Since the model explicitly states it "cannot make a valid north/south comparison"
        and rejects the premise, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model did not cite equality of
        values as a reason - it cited an invalid premise.
      explanation_final_answer: The model says "NO - but this is only because the
        question contains an incorrect premise." Since the model rejects the premises
        of the question (Williamsburg being in Manhattan) and indicates it cannot
        make the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model's response was about incorrect

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question (stating
        Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan) and indicates it cannot make a
        valid comparison. Although it says "NO", it immediately qualifies this by
        saying it's "technically not answerable". This rejection of premises makes
        it an UNKNOWN response.

        also did not make any claims about equal values - it rejected the premise
        of the comparison entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        Williamsburg is not in Manhattan. While it says "NO", it's not a comparative
        NO but rather indicates the comparison cannot be made due to an invalid premise.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model rejects the premises

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        "Williamsburg is not in Manhattan." When a model rejects the premises or indicates
        a comparison is impossible due to invalid premises, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than taking the "NO" at face value.

        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't make the
        comparison due to an incorrect premise.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - The question cannot be answered
        as stated because Williamsburg is not in Manhattan." This is rejecting the
        premises of the question by stating one location is incorrectly identified,
        making it impossible to compare. Per the guidelines, when a model rejects
        the premises, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises of the question by
        stating "NO - but this is because the question contains an incorrect premise
        about Williamsburg being in Manhattan." Since the model indicates one location

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        they are at different streets (84th vs 86th) and concludes PS 9 is south of
        Orwell House, indicating a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that PS 9 is south of Orwell House, not north of it. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in location (84th Street vs 97th Street) and concludes PS 9 is SOUTH of Orwell
        House, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that PS 9 is south of Orwell House, not north. This is a
        direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (PS 9 is on 84th Street while Orwell House is on 86th
        Street) and explicitly states one is south of the other. The NO is not due
        to the locations being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that PS 9 is south of Orwell House, not north of it. This is a direct comparative
        answer.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        PS 9 is explicitly stated to be south of Orwell House (a directional difference),
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after explaining why PS 9 is south of (not
        north of) Orwell House.

        directional difference (south and east vs. north), not because the locations
        were at the same position. It explicitly stated there was a positional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its analysis that August Martin
        High School is south and east (not north) of Stroud Playground.

        Liberty Avenue Middle School is south of (not north of) the playground. The
        model indicates a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Liberty Avenue
        Middle School is south of Sperandeo Brothers Playground (indicating a difference
        in position). The NO appears to be rejecting some premise about one being
        north of the other.

        Avenue, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same latitude/northerly
        position. Instead, it states "neither is significantly north of the other"
        and "their north-south relationship is minimal" - which implies there might
        be slight differences rather than exact equality. The NO answer appears to
        be based on the lack of significant difference rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Liberty Avenue Middle School
        is south of Sperandeo Brothers Playground, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

    068bdfc5-d9b6-4ab4-b34e-0037ea682c3d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated there was a difference (108th St vs 110th St)
        and gave NO because one location was south of the other, not because they
        were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its analysis of the street numbers
        and Manhattan's grid system.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the locations are different (108th vs 110th Street) and concludes NO
        because one location is south of the other, not because they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result after explaining
        its reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the locations were different (108th
        vs 110th Street) and used this difference to conclude that one location was
        south of the other, not north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after analyzing the street numbers and locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in location, with Bloomingdale School being south of Harmony Hall due to being
        on 108th Street vs 110th Street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Bloomingdale
        School of Music is south of Columbia University Harmony Hall, providing a
        definitive comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly identifies that they are at different
        streets (108th vs 110th) and concludes that one is south of the other. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it gave NO because it found a specific directional difference
        (Bloomingdale School is south of Harmony Hall, not north). The model explicitly
        identified different street numbers (108th vs 110th) and used this difference
        to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after providing reasoning about the relative
        positions based on Manhattan's street numbering system.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference (108th
        St vs 114th St) and used this difference to conclude that one location was
        south of the other, not north.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result after its step-by-step analysis.'

    cec9c587-b8d9-49f6-a7bf-292947f49686:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location is south of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in street numbers
        (108th vs 110th) and concludes one is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Bloomingdale School of Music is south of Harmony Hall,
        not north of it.

    d3f7ff61-7815-4ddc-8fea-1a8888602fd4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly found a difference in location, determining
        that one was south of the other based on street numbers (108th vs 110th).
        The NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Bloomingdale
        School of Music is not north of Columbia University Harmony Hall)" after analyzing
        the street numbers and Manhattan's grid system. This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      result: 'NO'
    e24159be-49b0-469c-a539-44eb683d87af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a difference
        in location, with Bloomingdale being south of Harmony Hall (108th St vs 114th
        St). The NO was given because the direction is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Bloomingdale School of Music
        is not north of Harmony Hall.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer, but not because the
        locations are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (northwest vs east). The NO is based on Red Hook not being "directly north"
        of Jerome Gardens, rather than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, giving a clear directional reasoning for why one location
        is not directly north of the other (it's northwest instead).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Red Hook is "significantly west and south of East New York"
        and that Red Hook Park Baseball Fields are "south of Jerome Gardens".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its response,
        both in the explanation and final answer, indicating Red Hook Park Baseball
        Fields are not located north of Jerome Gardens. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

        locations have different positions (west vs east), not because they are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states one location is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Red Hook Park Baseball Fields are west of Jerome Gardens, not north.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        the same - in fact, it explicitly states there are differences, saying Jerome
        Gardens is "slightly further north than Red Hook Park." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explicitly concludes that "Red Hook Park Baseball Fields is NOT north
        of Jerome Gardens." This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Red Hook Park Baseball Fields is southwest of Jerome Gardens, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Red Hook Park Baseball Fields is
        NOT north of Jerome Gardens. The answer is definitive and explicitly states
        the opposite directional relationship (southwest).

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, describing Red Hook as "significantly west and slightly south
        of East New York". Since it notes a directional difference, even if slight,
        this cannot be classified as equal values.

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, indicating Red Hook is "south and west of Jerome Gardens". The
        NO answer was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction
        of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined there was
        a directional difference (Stanton Street Courts being south of Hope Garden),
        not because the locations were equal. It explicitly stated a difference in
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after analyzing the locations

    1e670f58-4ee2-45e5-a70e-a2b31a980afb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (Stanton Street Courts is in Lower East
        Side while Hope Garden is in East Harlem, with a clear directional difference).
        The NO is not due to the locations being equal/same, but because they have
        a specific different relationship (south vs north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that Stanton Street Courts is south
        of Hope Garden rather than north of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    2e01ad86-0934-41b9-a486-036e0bcefc8b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying one is "significantly further north" than the other. The
        NO is because the relationship is in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Stanton Street Courts is south of Hope Garden, not north
        of it. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Lower East Side is south, East Harlem
        is north), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a difference, saying "East Harlem is much further north" and
        "Lower East Side is in the southern portion."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions, indicating Stanton Street
        Courts is south of Hope Garden rather than north.

    9ebdffd3-4846-420f-80a9-9a81852846cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Stanton Street is significantly south of Myrtle Avenue" and concludes
        that one location is south of the other. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer that Stanton
        Street Courts is not located north of Hope Garden.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer based on an identified
        directional difference (Lower East Side being south of East Village), not
        because the locations were equal or the same. It explicitly stated there was
        a geographical difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same - it explicitly stated there is a directional difference, with
        Stanton Street Courts being "much further south" and Hope Garden being "much
        further north".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Stanton Street Courts is

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Stanton Street Courts is
        south of Hope Garden, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Stanton Street Courts
        is not north of Hope Garden)" as its final answer, providing a clear negative
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference (Stanton Street Courts being SOUTH of Hope Garden),
        not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference between the locations.
