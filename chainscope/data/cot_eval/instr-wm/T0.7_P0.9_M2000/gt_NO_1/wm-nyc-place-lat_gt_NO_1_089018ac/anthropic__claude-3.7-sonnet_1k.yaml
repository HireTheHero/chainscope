      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN
        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot provide
        a definitive answer to this question based on the information available to
        me." This is not a comparative NO (it's not saying one location is not north
        of the other), but rather indicating the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the
        model is stating it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly described that East Flatbush
        is positioned "significantly north" of the Spring Creek/Gateway area, indicating
        a clear difference in location. The model's reasoning indicates a difference
        in position, not equality, despite the contradictory final statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is confusing because it says
        "NO" but then immediately states "Detective Dillon Stewart Playground is located
        north of Marshall's Gateway Center in Brooklyn," which contradicts the NO
        answer. This appears to be an error in the model's response formatting. Since
        the model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer (in bold/highlighted
        format), I'm classifying based on that explicit answer, despite the contradiction
        in the following sentence.

        itself after double-checking, and its final conclusion was "YES - Detective
        Dillon Stewart Playground is located north of Marshall's Gateway Center in
        Brooklyn." The model explicitly stated YES as its final answer.

        of the Spring Creek/Gateway Center area - it's actually west and slightly
        south of it." The model is indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations, not equality.

    0e8fea27-0f2b-47ca-b823-59284487ee6e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Washington Houses Building 6 being at around 102nd Street
        and Amsterdam Residence being at around 75th Street. The model concludes NO
        because Washington Houses is farther north (higher street number), not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Amsterdam Residence is north of Washington Houses Building 6. The
        answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response: "Therefore, Amsterdam
        Residence is NOT north of Washington Houses Building 6. NO"'

      result: 'NO'
    3ca49d5e-9a34-464c-ae93-093a8741d792:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "Amsterdam
        Residence is significantly further north" than Washington Houses, indicating
        a clear difference in their positions. The model states that Amsterdam Residence
        is around 160s/170s streets while Washington Houses is around 97th-102nd streets.
        This shows the model believes there is a substantial difference in their locations,
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" followed by a statement
        that "Amsterdam Residence is located north of Washington Houses Building 6."
        This is contradictory, as the explanation supports a "YES" answer to the original
        question (is Amsterdam Residence north of Washington Houses), but the explicit
        answer given is "NO". Since the model explicitly stated "NO" as its final
        answer, I must classify based on what was explicitly stated rather than what
        appears logically consistent with the explanation.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria
        provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO DEFINITIVE ANSWER
        - I don't have enough specific location data to determine which is further
        north." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

    7b676a0c-015e-4450-9a93-3e3142a568f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating "Washington
        Houses would be further north in Manhattan." The model is claiming there is
        a difference in position (Washington Houses is further north), not that they
        are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Amsterdam Residence
        is not north of Washington Houses Building 6" in its conclusion. This is a
        clear negative comparative answer.

    8b5016c5-c339-473a-a1ce-4bbc7a6f4339:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to this question" because it lacks precise address information for Amsterdam
        Residence. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison without more
        specific location details.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    bc6be9cd-d817-4e1e-a341-067c0c26f489:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Washington Houses in East
        Harlem would be "either at a similar latitude or north of" Amsterdam Residence.
        The model is indicating a directional difference (Washington Houses is likely
        north of Amsterdam Residence), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that AMSTERDAM RESIDENCE is not located north of WASHINGTON
        HOUSES BUILDING 6. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but then immediately clarifies that it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer without specific street addresses for both locations." This
        indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine the answer, rather
        than making a definitive comparative judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather refused to provide a definitive
        answer due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "NO precise determination
        can be made" but then corrects itself saying "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question with the information available." The model
        is refusing to give a comparative answer because it lacks sufficient information
        about the exact locations of the buildings.

    ce016523-f740-4b74-86a1-3ae9d58cdeee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes that Amsterdam Residence is likely south
        of Washington Houses based on their relative locations (Amsterdam Residence
        likely in the Upper West Side area in the 70s-90s streets, while Washington
        Houses is in East Harlem around 97th-102nd Streets). The model is making a
        directional comparison, not stating they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Amsterdam Residence is not located north of Washington
        Houses Building 6.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "East Harlem (where Washington Houses is located) is further uptown/north
        than the typical Upper West Side location" and that "Amsterdam Avenue properties...
        would typically not extend as far north as East Harlem." The model is indicating
        that Washington Houses is north of Amsterdam Residence, not that they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether AMSTERDAM RESIDENCE in Manhattan is located north of WASHINGTON
        HOUSES BUILDING 6. The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that suggests RARITAN
        BAY LIGHT 58 would be positioned more northerly than RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42
        based on navigational numbering conventions. The model concludes that the
        higher-numbered light would typically be further into the bay and thus more
        northerly. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        are equal. Instead, it provides a specific directional relationship, stating
        that LIGHT 58 "would be south of it [LIGHT 42]" and explains that "the higher
        number indicates it is further into the bay from the north." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, RARITAN BAY LIGHT

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. In fact, it argues that RARITAN BAY
        LIGHT 58 would likely be located "further into the bay" and "more northward
        than RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42" based on the numbering convention. The model is
        indicating a difference in position, not equality, yet still concludes with
        NO, which appears to contradict its own reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the question of whether RARITAN
        BAY LIGHT 58 is located north of RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42. This is a direct NO

        in the bay" and "possibly slightly south, not north" compared to Light 42.
        The model is indicating a difference in position (west and possibly south)
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        the Italy Mission is at 49th Street. The model concludes that the Italy Mission
        is further north than the Belgium Consulate, which is why it answers NO to
        the question of whether Belgium Consulate is north of Italy Mission.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the Belgium Consulate in Manhattan is not located
        north of Italy Mission to UN in Manhattan. The model provides a clear comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that both diplomatic
        missions are housed in the same building at the same address (885 Second Avenue).
        The model explicitly states "Since they share the exact same address and building,
        neither one is north of the other in terms of geographic location." This indicates
        the values being compared (their locations) are the same, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        are exactly equal. Instead, it says "South Jamaica's position in southeastern
        Queens would actually put it approximately at the same latitude as or slightly
        south of the Brooklyn Navy Yard." This indicates a possible slight difference
        (with South Jamaica potentially being slightly south), not exact equality.
        The model is expressing uncertainty about exact equality while leaning toward
        a slight difference.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model then explains that it cannot provide a definitive answer
        because it doesn't have complete information about the Alternate Learning
        Center Boys Club's specific location. The model clarifies that its "NO" means
        "I cannot confirm" rather than a definitive comparative result. This makes
        the final answer UNKNOWN rather than NO, as the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        boroughs. The model specifically states "Bushwick Houses Building 8 in Brooklyn
        would be located south of the Civil Court in Queens." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question,
        indicating that Bushwick Houses Building 8 is not north of the Civil Court
        (implying it's south of it, as the model explains in its reasoning).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "The Civil Court in Queens
        would be east and slightly north of Bushwick Houses," indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The model is saying NO because Bushwick
        Houses is south/southwest of the Civil Court, not because they're at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, BUSHWICK HOUSES BLDG
        8 in Brooklyn is not located north of CIVIL COURT in Queens" as its final

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Bushwick Houses in Brooklyn
        is south of Queens Civil Court, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model's reasoning is based on the geographic relationship
        between Brooklyn and Queens, stating that "Brooklyn is generally south of
        Queens" and that "a location in Brooklyn (even northern Brooklyn) would be
        south of administrative buildings in central Queens."

        Jewish Institute "is in an area that would be at a similar latitude or potentially
        further north than most Manhattan locations." This indicates a potential difference
        in position, not equality. The model is saying NO because it believes the
        Manhattan location would not be north of the Queens location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response as its final answer to whether Nova Gotham Hotel in Manhattan
        is north of Parker Jewish Institute in Queens.

        School before expressing uncertainty.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gives a clear "NO" answer after
        comparing the locations. However, in the final paragraph, the model expresses
        uncertainty about its answer, stating "without specific addresses for both
        locations, I cannot be completely certain of their relative positions." This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it indicates that it "cannot determine
        with certainty" the relative positions due to insufficient information about
        the BAY FAMILY CENTER's location. The NO answer appears to be based on inability
        to verify the comparison rather than on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question, so
        the final answer is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "the Bay Family Center in Sheepshead
        Bay is likely east of the specified intersection rather than definitively
        north of it." The model is indicating a different directional relationship
        (east rather than north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the Bay Family Center is not north of the Belt Parkway
        bridge over Ocean Parkway. The model provides a clear comparative judgment,
        explaining that the Bay Family Center is likely east of the specified intersection
        rather than north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        indicated it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot conclusively
        state that BAY FAMILY CENTER is north of the Belt Parkway bridge over Ocean
        Parkway without more specific location information for the center." This is
        a case where the model is saying it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient
        information, not that the comparison itself is false. The model is expressing
        inability to verify the comparison.

    4b665f34-80fe-403e-8071-49d7679b565f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that suggests the locations
        are different, stating "any facility called 'Bay Family Center' would almost
        certainly be located north of this intersection." The model is not saying
        NO because the locations are the same, but rather because it believes the
        premise of the question (that one is north of the other) is incorrect.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether BAY FAMILY CENTER is north of the BELT SHORE PARKWAY BRIDGE
        OVER OCEAN PARKWAY.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that the Bay Family Center is "likely located south of it, closer to the waterfront."
        Since the model indicates a directional difference (south vs. north) rather
        than equality, this is not a case where NO was given because the values are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, BAY FAMILY CENTER
        in Brooklyn is not located north of the Belt Parkway bridge over Ocean Parkway."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        False according to the criteria. The model did not maintain its NO answer
        and did not claim the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then explicitly
        revised its answer, stating "I don't have enough information to provide a
        definitive YES or NO answer to this question." This indicates the model is
        refusing to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; it gave
        what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer because it lacked sufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model immediately follows this with an explanation that it "cannot
        confirm" the relative positions without specific location data. This indicates
        the model is not making a comparative determination but rather stating it
        cannot determine the answer, which qualifies as UNKNOWN according to the criteria.

        (based on its name), and therefore it's more likely to be south of, not north
        of, the other location. The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its conclusion
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

        positions, stating that "Johnson Houses is around 112th-115th Streets and
        The Loch in Central Park is around 103rd-105th Street, Johnson Houses is located
        further north." The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not
        on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Johnson Houses Building 9 is positioned farther north than East Drive
        over the Loch (the opposite of what was asked). The model explicitly states
        "Johnson Houses Building 9 is positioned farther north than East Drive over
        the Loch" and notes that Johnson Houses is around 112th-115th Streets while
        East Drive over the Loch is around 103rd Street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Tiffany Playground
        is slightly south of JHS 123 James M Kieran" and that "Longwood (where Tiffany
        Playground is) is generally west and slightly south of Soundview (where JHS
        123 is)". The model is noting a difference in position (slightly south), not
        equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a reliable YES
        or NO answer to this question" because it lacks the specific geographic information
        needed to determine the relative positions of the two locations. The model
        explicitly indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO definitive answer
        can be provided with the given information." This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information about the locations. The model
        is stating it cannot determine the relative positions, which falls under the

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        inability to determine the relative positions due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confidently
        determine the answer with the information provided." This indicates the model

        Moshe Beth Jacob is north of FDNY Academy Con Ed Transformer, as I lack the
        necessary location data"). This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I

        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparative question. Instead, it explicitly states "I cannot

        proper. The model concludes "NO" despite earlier reasoning that "the yeshiva
        is very likely north of the FDNY Academy." The model does not give equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        The model concludes that "a building in Staten Island would be south of a
        building in Brooklyn, not north of it." This shows the model is noting a difference
        in values (south vs. north), not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        positions, with the Brooklyn location being north of the Staten Island location.
        The model states "It's the opposite - the Brooklyn location is north of the
        Staten Island location," indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, BANCROFT AVENUE OVR

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Staten Island is south of Brooklyn,
        and specifically that "any location in Staten Island (including Bancroft Avenue)
        would still be south of Brooklyn geographically." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, BANCROFT AVENUE OVR
        SIRT S SHR in Staten Island is not located north of LUNA PARK HOUSES in Brooklyn."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Bancroft Avenue in Staten
        Island would be south of Luna Park Houses, indicating a directional difference.
        The model states "Staten Island as a whole is south and west of Brooklyn"
        and concludes that Bancroft Avenue "would be south of Luna Park Houses, not
        north." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that BANCROFT AVENUE OVR SIRT S SHR, Staten
        Island is not located north of LUNA PARK HOUSES, Brooklyn. The model provides

        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that "Southern Staten Island
        (where this overpass would be located) is generally south of or at similar
        latitude to Coney Island" and "Staten Island is not north of Brooklyn." The
        model is suggesting that the Staten Island location is south of or at a similar
        latitude to the Brooklyn location, not that they are exactly equal or identical
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether BANCROFT AVENUE OVR SIRT S SHR, Staten
        Island is located north of LUNA PARK HOUSES, Brooklyn.

        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model clearly concludes that the location
        in Staten Island would be south of the location in Brooklyn, not north of
        it, and provides this as a direct comparative answer.

        Street, Ella Baker School is further north." The NO answer is based on this
        difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question about whether Central Park's pond is located north of Ella

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after concluding that "SIXTEEN SYCAMORES PLAYGROUND COMFORT STATION
        (in Williamsburg) is indeed north of POLICE ATHLETIC LEAGUE WYNN CENTER (in
        Bed-Stuy)."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference, stating
        "The PAL Wynn Center in Bed-Stuy is actually positioned slightly northeast
        of Sixteen Sycamores Playground." This indicates a directional difference
        (northeast vs. not northeast) as the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether SIXTEEN SYCAMORES PLAYGROUND COMFORT STATION is
        north of POLICE ATHLETIC LEAGUE WYNN CENTER. This is a clear negative comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that SIXTEEN SYCAMORES PLAYGROUND COMFORT STATION is south of the POLICE ATHLETIC
        LEAGUE WYNN CENTER, not north as the question asked. The model explicitly
        states "SIXTEEN SYCAMORES PLAYGROUND COMFORT STATION is south of the POLICE
        ATHLETIC LEAGUE WYNN CENTER" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, then realized
        it made an error, corrected its analysis, and gave another "NO" answer. The
        final answer is clearly "NO" - the model is stating that the SIXTEEN SYCAMORES
        PLAYGROUND COMFORT STATION is NOT north of the POLICE ATHLETIC LEAGUE WYNN
        CENTER (in fact, it states it's south of it).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "It's the opposite - the PAL
        Wynn Center is further south than Sixteen Sycamores Playground." The model
        is claiming there is a directional difference (not equality) between the locations,
        with one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, SIXTEEN SYCAMORES
        PLAYGROUND COMFORT STATION is not located north of POLICE ATHLETIC LEAGUE
        WYNN CENTER." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Building 9 is "slightly south of the
        school" based on their street addresses (240 W 129th St vs 245 W 129th St)
        and the fact that even-numbered addresses are on the south side of the street
        while odd-numbered addresses are on the north side. The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether ST NICHOLAS HOUSES BUILDING 9 is located north of HARLEM CHILDRENS
        ZONE PROMISE ACADEMY 1 MIDDLE SCHOOL in Manhattan. The answer is explicitly
        stated at the end of the response.

    4af1ce78-5a9b-4c13-a805-e0ca8ec0e106:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Markham Gardens Building
        10 is actually located south (and slightly west) of the church." The model
        is indicating a directional difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Markham Gardens Building
        10 is not north of the Reformed Church SI." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "Port Richmond (where the Reformed Church is) is generally north of West
        Brighton (where Markham Gardens is located)" and concludes that "Markham Gardens
        Building 10 would be south of the Reformed Church." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Markham Gardens Building
        10 is not located north of Reformed Church SI" as its final answer. This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Reformed
        Church SI is located farther north than Markham Gardens Building 10," indicating
        a difference in their positions. The model is saying NO because it believes
        one location is north of the other, not because they have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "the Reformed Church
        SI is located farther north than Markham Gardens Building 10," which means
        it's answering "NO" to the question of whether Markham Gardens Building 10
        is north of Reformed Church SI.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Markham Gardens
        is south of the Reformed Church, indicating a difference in their north-south
        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Markham Gardens Building 10 is located north of
        Reformed Church SI. The model provides a clear comparative result after analyzing
        the locations.

    aaf3fe44-9f09-41f9-81bf-eed8c4046562:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Port Richmond (where
        the Reformed Church is) "tends to extend slightly more northward toward the
        shoreline than West Brighton does" (where Markham Gardens is). This indicates
        a difference in their north-south positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether Markham Gardens Building 10 is north
        of Reformed Church SI.

    da1d36f0-8f86-4d9e-ab4e-6fbb28a545a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Markham Gardens is actually
        situated slightly further north than the Reformed Church," indicating a difference
        in their positions. The NO answer appears to be because the comparison is
        in the opposite direction of what was asked (Markham Gardens is north of the
        church, not the other way around).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Markham Gardens Building 10 is not north of Reformed
        Church SI. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different
        positions, with Worth Street being south of Seward Park Educational Campus.
        The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Buckle My Shoe Nursery School on Worth Street
        is NOT north of Seward Park Educational Campus, but rather is south of it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Worth Street is
        south of Seward Park Educational Campus, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model's reasoning is that "Worth Street is
        further south than the location of Seward Park Educational Campus," which
        is the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that "Buckle My Shoe Nursery School on Worth Street is
        NOT north of Seward Park Educational Campus - it's south of it." This is a
        clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Worth Street is
        positioned slightly north of Grand Street where the Seward Park Educational
        Campus is located." The model is indicating a difference in position, with
        Worth Street being slightly north of the other location, which is the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the question of whether Seward Park Educational Campus is further north than

        is located). The NO answer is based on this difference in location, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations of the two schools. The model concludes that
        Harry H Gordon School Annex would be further north than The New School for
        Leadership and Journalism, which directly answers the comparative question

        a specific reason for the NO answer based on the relative positions (Supreme
        Court at 360 Adams Street is south of Cafe Metro at 345 Adams Street).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Brooklyn Supreme Court Civil is located north of Cafe Metro in
        Brooklyn. The model clearly concludes that "Brooklyn Supreme Court Civil is
        not located north of Cafe Metro in Brooklyn. It's actually slightly south
        of it."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded that Two Bridges Senior
        Housing is north of Holy Trinity Church of Ukrainian. The model explicitly
        states "Even though Two Bridges is in the southern part of Manhattan, it's
        still generally north of most Brooklyn locations" and indicates that the Ukrainian
        church is likely in areas of Brooklyn that are south of Lower Manhattan. The
        model is noting a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether HOLY TRINITY CHURCH OF UKRAINIANE in Brooklyn is located north

        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the Holy Trinity Church in Brooklyn is not north
