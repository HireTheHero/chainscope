      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES, Detective Dillon Stewart Playground is north of
        Marshall's Gateway Center" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2850096f-bbed-406d-ab3c-80624b127873:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that "East Flatbush (where
        Detective Dillon Stewart Playground is) is generally north of the Spring Creek
        area (where Marshall's Gateway Center is)." The NO answer appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning, but it did not claim equality as the reason for
        the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether one location is north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    3807aba8-1d71-42ae-a788-4aa569cfa653:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "East Flatbush (where
        Detective Dillon Stewart Playground is) is north of East New York (where Marshall's
        Gateway Center is)." The model is indicating a difference in position, not
        equality. The NO answer appears to be addressing whether Detective Dillon
        Stewart Playground is north of Marshall's Gateway Center, and the explanation
        suggests the opposite relationship (that East Flatbush is north of East New
        York).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether one location is north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer after further analysis. The
        final determination was that "Detective Dillon Stewart Playground is north
        of Marshall's Gateway Center".

    ccf8ab1e-120e-4095-a266-81fe220d2b37:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that East Flatbush (where
        Detective Dillon Stewart Playground is) is "actually north of the Spring Creek/Gateway
        Center area." The model is indicating a difference in position, not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Detective Dillon Stewart Playground
        is not north of Marshall's Gateway Center. In fact, the model concludes that
        East Flatbush (where the playground is) is actually north of the Spring Creek/Gateway
        Center area.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or
        NO answer with the information available" because it lacks the precise location
        of Amsterdam Residence. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without more specific information.

      result: UNKNOWN
    473aa806-f927-4c3d-9ce6-fbf22d4cb710:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that Amsterdam Residence is "more likely to be south of" Washington Houses
        Building 6. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Amsterdam Residence
        in Manhattan is likely not located north of Washington Houses Building 6."
        This is a clear negative comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4f32df09-0dac-44bc-be4c-2a368b4b6742:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it analyzes their relative positions in Manhattan,
        noting that Washington Houses is in East Harlem and Amsterdam Residence is
        likely in the Upper West Side. The model does not claim they are at the same
        location or have equal coordinates as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of Amsterdam Residence
        and Washington Houses Building 6.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    51797de0-c27d-499b-aaf6-ef239d0e6fd4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Amsterdam Residence is likely
        south of Washington Houses, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model states "Amsterdam Residence is most likely in the
        Upper West Side portion of Amsterdam Avenue, which would place it south of
        Washington Houses." This shows the model believes there is a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Amsterdam Residence
        is likely not located north of Washington Houses Building 6" as its final
        answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    789d363c-9321-4678-9bb0-dd7505512166:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Amsterdam Residence is most
        likely not north of Washington Houses based on their different geographical
        locations in Manhattan (Amsterdam Residence on the Upper West Side vs. Washington
        Houses in East Harlem). The model is making a directional comparison and finding
        that one is not north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response, indicating that Amsterdam Residence is not north
        of Washington Houses Building 6.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7e74f27e-9ac2-44b0-b437-70d58f7d86aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        In the final step, it explicitly states "I cannot give a confident YES or
        NO answer" because it lacks precise address information. This is a case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8e941f19-54a3-4bac-91f4-dbc0cabb74b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks specific information about the
        exact location of Amsterdam Residence to make a determination. The model is
        refusing to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    8ebae18e-96a9-4113-b109-d3e8ef5e9e42:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it suggests that Amsterdam Residence is likely south
        of or at approximately the same latitude as Washington Houses, indicating
        a directional difference. The model's reasoning is based on the relative positions
        of the neighborhoods, not on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Amsterdam Residence
        is likely not located north of Washington Houses Building 6" as its final
        answer. This is a clear negative comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    96ddfaac-4353-4642-a5ae-d5e6aa7e456b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the relative positions without specific address
        information), this question doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer"
        because it lacks the specific street address information for Amsterdam Residence.
        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison without this information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9de780a3-db19-4725-b733-1a019a115e91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about the exact location
        of Amsterdam Residence and states it "cannot definitively determine" the relative
        positions due to lack of specific address information. The NO is based on
        inability to verify the comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model does express uncertainty about the exact locations, it provides
        a definitive "NO" response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    1cc1ae0d-2a9b-4796-93eb-76c50b6a5bc9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that LIGHT 58 is likely
        west of LIGHT 42 based on navigational numbering systems. The model concludes
        that "LIGHT 58 is likely west of LIGHT 42, but not necessarily north of it,"
        indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer
        appears to be in response to whether one light is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different directional relationship,
        stating that "It would most likely be located east or northeast of LIGHT 42."
        The model is indicating a different directional relationship (east/northeast)
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, RARITAN BAY LIGHT
        58 is not located north of RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then reconsidered
        and stated "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer based on the information
        available." This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison due
        to lack of information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that LIGHT 58 would be "further inland (westward)
        from LIGHT 42" and that "the primary directional difference would be west,
        not north." The model is indicating there is a directional difference (westward
        rather than northward), not that the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - RARITAN BAY LIGHT
        58 is not located north of RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42" as its final answer. This
        is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "I should not provide a yes or no answer" after realizing
        it didn't have enough information to make a determination. This constitutes
        a refusal to provide a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the criteria, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't determine the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confidently
        state that RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58 is north of RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42 based solely
        on their numbering)". This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot
        determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.
        The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

        of the Rockaway Peninsula along Jamaica Bay" and "Vernam Basin is not meaningfully
        north of Ocean Bay Community Center - they are roughly at the same latitude."
        This indicates that the model is saying NO because the locations are at approximately
        the same latitude (north-south position), making them equal in terms of the
        comparison being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        equal north-south positions, with the only difference being that "Vernam Basin
        is slightly west of Ocean Bay Community Center." Since the model states they
        are at the same latitude/north-south position, and this equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer, this qualifies as equal values.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that both locations are at the exact same address (885 2nd Avenue). It explicitly
        states "both are at the exact same address, neither is north of the other
        in terms of street geography." The equality of their positions is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "They are in the same building
        at the same latitude" as the reason for its NO answer. It explicitly notes
        that the locations have the same address and are in the same building, with
        neither being north or south of the other in terms of street geography. The
        model's NO answer is based on the equality of their latitudinal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. The Belgium Consulate
        is not located north of the Italy Mission to the UN in Manhattan." This is
        a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that both locations are at exactly the same address and in the same building.
        It explicitly states "they appear to be in the same building at the same address"
        and "they would be considered at the same latitude." The equality of their
        locations is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that the Belgium Consulate is not located north of the Italy Mission
        to the UN in Manhattan.

    aaf49fb6-c1fa-4e27-b398-0945b1f73b72:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        locations are in the same building at the same address (885 Second Avenue),
        and therefore at the same latitude. The model explicitly states "they are
        at the same latitude since they're in the same building" and "neither is north
        of the other." The equality of their positions is the primary reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether one location is north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then recognized
        an error in its reasoning and explicitly corrected itself to "YES" as its
        final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "South Jamaica is east and
        possibly slightly south of the Brooklyn Navy Yard," indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The model is saying NO because one location
        is not north of the other (it's east and possibly slightly south), not because
        they are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "South Jamaica Projects
        Building 12 is not north of Brooklyn Navy Yard Building 92."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, concluding
        that "S Jamaica Projects would be south of the Brooklyn Navy Yard." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference (south vs. north), not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, S JAMAICA PROJECTS
        BUILDING 12 in Queens is NOT located north of BROOKLYN NAVY YARD BUILDING
        92 in Brooklyn." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it describes their positions as different,
        with South Jamaica Projects being "approximately at the same latitude or slightly
        south of the Brooklyn Navy Yard." The mention of "slightly south" indicates
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on the determination
        that S Jamaica Projects is not north of Brooklyn Navy Yard.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, S Jamaica Projects
        Building 12 in Queens is not located north of Brooklyn Navy Yard Building
        92 in Brooklyn." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Jamaica Projects would be
        "east or slightly southeast" of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and mentions that
        "Jamaica is roughly at the same latitude or slightly south of the Brooklyn
        Navy Yard." The model is noting directional differences, not equality, as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that S Jamaica Projects Building 12
        is not north of Brooklyn Navy Yard Building 92.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that S Jamaica Projects is located "east/southeast"
        of Brooklyn Navy Yard, not north of it. The model is rejecting one directional
        relationship (north) in favor of another (east/southeast), not claiming the
        locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "S JAMAICA PROJECTS
        BUILDING 12 is located east/southeast of BROOKLYN NAVY YARD BUILDING 92, not
        north of it" and then gives a clear "NO" as its final answer.

        as the reason for its NO answer: "It''s actually located northeast of it."
        This indicates a difference in position (northeast vs. north), not equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, S JAMAICA PROJECTS
        BUILDING 12 in Queens is not located north of BROOKLYN NAVY YARD BUILDING
        92 in Brooklyn." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states differences in location,
        concluding that "South Jamaica Projects would be further south than the Brooklyn
        Navy Yard" and "The Brooklyn Navy Yard's northern position in Brooklyn puts
        it north of South Jamaica." The NO answer is based on these geographical differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, concluding
        that "the Brooklyn Navy Yard is likely further north than South Jamaica Projects."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference,
        stating "South Jamaica is actually located further south than the Brooklyn
        Navy Yard." This indicates a difference in position (one is further south
        than the other), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is actually the opposite of what was asked - it states
        that Jamaica Projects is south of Brooklyn Navy Yard, not north of it. The
        model is indicating a difference in positions (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "S JAMAICA PROJECTS
        BUILDING 12 in Queens is NOT north of BROOKLYN NAVY YARD BUILDING 92 in Brooklyn.
        It's actually south of it." This is followed by a clear "NO" at the end.

        for the NO answer, stating that "Hammersley Avenue and the Presbyterian Church
        located there are in the northern part of the Bronx, while Lehman College
        is more centrally located." The model is indicating that one location is north
        of the other, not that they are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Lehman College Communications Building is NOT north

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Wakefield/Edenwald
        (where Hammersley Ave is) is further north than Bedford Park (where Lehman
        College is)" and "the Presbyterian Church on Hammersley Avenue would be north
        of Lehman College's Communications Building." The model is noting a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        different north-south positions, with Wakefield (where Hammersley Avenue is
        located) being "further north than the Bedford Park area where Lehman College
        is located." The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and directly addresses whether
        the Lehman College Communications Building is north of the Presbyterian Church
        on Hammersley Avenue.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then corrected
        itself after checking coordinates and explicitly stated "YES, Roosevelt, Queens
        is located slightly north of the General Electric Building in Manhattan" as
        its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9bc7f516-ec60-45a3-b049-d7e350ca6edb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states they are "approximately
        at similar latitudes, with Roosevelt possibly being slightly north." The model
        acknowledges a possible slight difference in position (with Roosevelt possibly
        being slightly north), which means it's not claiming equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Roosevelt, Queens is
        not north of the General Electric Building in Manhattan."
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Roosevelt in Queens
        is south of the General Electric Building, indicating a directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Roosevelt in Queens
        is located south of the General Electric Building in Manhattan, not north
        of it" and then gives a definitive "NO" as the final answer.

    ce9db084-82b8-4bf5-8816-3f7fd36038bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (positions)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "Roosevelt is generally at a similar
        latitude or slightly south of Midtown Manhattan where the GE Building is located."
        The model indicates there is a directional difference (slightly south), not
        equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Roosevelt, Queens is not north of the General Electric
        Building in Manhattan. This is a clear negative comparative answer to the
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "Roosevelt in Queens is approximately
        at the same latitude or slightly south of the GE Building" which indicates
        a potential difference (slightly south). The model is not saying NO because
        the locations are exactly the same, but rather because Roosevelt is not north
        of the GE Building (it's either at the same latitude or slightly south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Roosevelt in Queens
        is not located north of the General Electric Building in Manhattan" as its
        final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f5a78775-458c-4f1a-bc1a-6fb5c15b9ab7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "It's actually slightly
        south or at approximately the same latitude." The mention of "slightly south"
        indicates a difference in values, even if small. Even though it mentions "approximately
        the same latitude" as an alternative possibility, the primary reason given
        is that Roosevelt is "slightly south" of the GE Building.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Roosevelt, Queens
        is not located north of the General Electric Building in Manhattan." This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states
        that Morris II Houses is southeast of Highbridge Senior Center, not north
        of it. The model identified a specific directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Morris II Houses Building
        14 is not north of Highbridge Senior Center, but rather southeast of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (positions)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Morris II Houses Building 14 would be
        "east and possibly slightly south" of Highbridge Senior Center. The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality, as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Morris II Houses Building 14 is north of Highbridge
        Senior Center.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Morris II Houses Building 14 is southeast of Highbridge Senior Center,
        not north of it. The model identifies a directional difference (southeast
        vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Morris II Houses Building
        14 is southeast of Highbridge Senior Center, it is NOT north of Highbridge
        Senior Center."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, concluding
        that "Morris II Houses Building 14 is in Morrisania which is south of Highbridge
        where the senior center is located." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (south vs. north), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Morris II Houses is
        not north of Highbridge Senior Center" and ends with a clear "NO" response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional analysis, stating
        that "Morrisania is east and slightly south of Highbridge" and "Highbridge
        is further northwest in the Bronx compared to Morrisania where Morris Houses
        is located." The model concludes that "Morris Houses would not be north of
        Highbridge Senior Center" based on these directional differences, not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Morris II Houses Building 14 in the Bronx is located

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different directional relationship,
        stating that Springfield Gardens Childhood Center is "located east/southeast
        of" Mott Hall Bridges Academy, not north of it. The NO answer is based on
        a different directional relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Springfield Gardens

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the relationship between
        the locations is different than what was asked - specifically that Springfield
        Gardens Childhood Center is east/southeast of Mott Hall Bridges Academy, not
        north of it. The model is indicating a different directional relationship
        exists, not that the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Springfield Gardens
        Childhood Center would be east or southeast of Mott Hall Bridges Academy,
        not north of it," and then gives a clear "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Brownsville (where Mott
        Hall Bridges Academy is) "would place it north of Springfield Gardens." The
        model is indicating a difference in north-south positioning, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether Springfield Gardens Childhood Center is north of Mott Hall Bridges
        Academy.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Springfield Gardens is east and slightly south of Brownsville, Brooklyn.
        It is not north of Brownsville." The model is indicating a specific directional
        difference (east and slightly south) rather than equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes "Springfield Gardens Childhood
        Center is not located north of Mott Hall Bridges Academy" and ends with a
        clear "NO" answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different directional relationship,
        stating that Springfield Gardens Childhood Center is "located east/southeast
        of it" rather than north. Since the model is indicating a different directional
        relationship (east/southeast) rather than equality, this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, SPRINGFIELD GARDENS
        CHILDHOOD CENTER in Queens is not located north of MOTT HALL BRIDGES ACADEMY
        in Brooklyn." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Springfield Gardens Childhood
        Center would be approximately at the same latitude or slightly north of Mott
        Hall Bridges Academy" and then concludes with "NO". This suggests the model
        is saying NO because the locations are at approximately the same latitude
        or Springfield Gardens is slightly north. Since the model indicates they are
        either equal in latitude or slightly different (with Springfield Gardens being
        slightly north), this is not a case where the NO is based purely on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment about the

        is in Staten Island, which is south/southwest of Brooklyn where BROOKLYN COLL
        NEWMAN CENTER is located. The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Staten Island being south of Brooklyn), not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Staten Island location is south of the Brooklyn location, indicating
        a directional difference (not equality). The model explicitly states "the
        Staten Island location must be south of the Brooklyn location" and "the Staten
        Island location is south of the Brooklyn location."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model analyzed the geographic relationship

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        for its NO answer - that Staten Island is south of Brooklyn, so a location
        in Staten Island cannot be north of a location in Brooklyn. The model is indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "SOUTH AVENUE OVER B&O
        RAILRD in Staten Island cannot be north of BROOKLYN COLL NEWMAN CENTER in
        Brooklyn" and provides "NO" as its definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model concluded NO based on its
        analysis that Queens Civil Court is likely north of Bushwick Houses. The model
        indicated a directional difference between the two locations, stating "Queens
        is still generally north of this area" and "This would place it north of Bushwick
        Houses." The model is asserting a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        the same geographical location." The model explicitly states "neither can
        be considered north of the other" because they are "at the same location."
        This equality of location is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        that EXPLORE CHARTER SCHOOL is east of PARKSIDE PREPARATORY ACADEMY, showing
        they have different positions, just not in the north-south dimension that
        was asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that one school is not north of the other. The model
        provides reasoning that the schools are on the same avenue which runs east-west,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" due to lack of information about the schools'
        locations. The model refuses to make a comparison because it doesn't have
        the necessary data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Mount Roraima Day Care School being north of the School of
        Creativity and Innovation. The model gives a directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the School of Creativity and Innovation is north of Mount Roraima
        Day Care School. The answer is explicitly provided at the end of the response.

        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question with the information available." The model refuses
        to make a comparison because it lacks the necessary location data to determine
        the relative positions of the schools.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the two schools
        are in different locations with one being south of the other. The model states
        that "the School of Creativity and Innovation is south of Mount Roraima Day
        Care School, not north of it" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "the School of Creativity
        and Innovation is south of Mount Roraima Day Care School, not north of it"
        and provides a clear "NO" at the end.

    4cd4324d-64cf-4477-8527-1eac6f37eff8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't make the determination
        due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - I cannot provide
        a definitive yes or no answer to this question with the information available."
        This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information,
        not that the comparison is false. The model is saying it cannot make the comparison
        without specific addresses or coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the schools are
        in different locations with different north-south positions. The model concludes
        that Mount Roraima Day Care School is north of School of Creativity and Innovation,
        not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "the SCHOOL OF CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION is NOT north
        of MOUNT RORAIMA DAY CARE SCHOOL" and ends with a clear "NO" response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the
        question of whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" and explains that it lacks the necessary information
        to make the geographical comparison. The model is refusing to provide a definitive
        answer due to insufficient data.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Ewen Playground is "further
        north than Faith Christian Academy," indicating a difference in their north-south
        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Faith Christian Academy is not north of Ewen Playground.
        The model provides a clear comparative answer.

        EWEN PLAYGROUND is north of FAITH CHRISTIAN ACADEMY." The model's reasoning
        is based on the relative positions being different (one is north of the other),
        not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, FAITH CHRISTIAN ACADEMY
        is not located north of EWEN PLAYGROUND." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that Faith Christian Academy is south of Ewen Playground,
        indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model specifically
        notes that Ewen Playground is further north (at 232nd Street) than Faith Christian
        Academy (at 222nd Street).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Faith Christian

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating
        "Faith Christian Academy is slightly further north based on the street numbering."
        This indicates the model is saying NO because one location is slightly further
        north than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "the USTA West Gate in Queens
        is located slightly north of the Church of the Covenant in Manhattan." The
        model identifies a directional difference (slightly north), which means it's
        not claiming the locations are at the same position. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight," any difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states "The USTA West Gate in
        Queens is slightly north of the 42nd Street location in Manhattan." This indicates
        a difference in position (one being slightly north of the other), not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        note the locations are "very close in terms of latitude" but ultimately concluded
        the USTA facility is "slightly north" and gave a "YES" answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered,
        double-checked the latitudes, and explicitly changed its final answer to "YES"
        at the very end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Midtown Manhattan (around
        46th Street) is generally further north than New Hyde Park in eastern Queens."
        This indicates a difference in north-south positions, not equality. The NO
        answer appears to be given because the model believes Nova Gotham Hotel is
        north of Parker Jewish Institute (not that they're at the same latitude).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether one location is north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that "Parker Jewish Institute
        in New Hyde Park, Queens is likely north or at a similar latitude to Nova
        Gotham Hotel in Manhattan." The model mentions they could be at "similar latitude"
        but also says Parker Jewish Institute could be "north" of Nova Gotham Hotel,
        indicating a potential difference in position. Since the model doesn't explicitly
        state they are equal/identical/the same as the primary reason for the NO answer,
        this doesn't qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and definitive at the end
        of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was REFUSED),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions. The
        model ultimately refused to make the comparison due to uncertainty about locations,
        not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then reconsidered
        and stated "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" due to uncertainty
        about the exact locations. This indicates the model is refusing to provide
        a definitive comparative answer.

        likely not north of the Belt Parkway bridge over Ocean Parkway" and that "the
        family center is likely either south of or at a similar latitude to the bridge."
        This indicates a potential difference in position, not equality, as the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then reconsidered
        and stated "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" due to insufficient

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        inability to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that BAY FAMILY CENTER is north of the Belt Parkway bridge over Ocean Parkway)".
        This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information,
        not that it's making a definitive comparative judgment. The parenthetical
        clarification shows it's expressing inability to verify the comparison rather
        than asserting a definitive "NO" to the comparison itself.

        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it concludes that "the Bay Family
        Center is likely north of the Belt Shore Parkway bridge over Ocean Parkway,"
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer contradicts this reasoning
        but does not claim equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which contradicts its reasoning that "the Bay Family Center is likely
        north of the Belt Shore Parkway bridge over Ocean Parkway." This appears to
        be a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        the information provided)". This is a case where the model is saying "NO,
        I cannot confirm" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information. The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively determine"
        and "I cannot confirm" which means it's rejecting its ability to answer the
        comparative question.

        Parkway." The model is indicating a difference in position (one is slightly
        north of the other), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

        "most likely be north of the Belt Parkway's crossing with Ocean Parkway,"
        indicating a difference in position. The model states "Bay Ridge and nearby
        neighborhoods where a 'Bay Family Center' would likely be located are slightly
        north of the Belt Parkway." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        for the NO answer, stating that Al Mamoor School is "northeast" rather than
        "directly north" of Henry Street Settlement. This indicates a difference in
        position/direction, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Al Mamoor School

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "The Johnson Houses complex is likely further north."
        This indicates the model believes there is a directional difference between
        the locations, not that they are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer. The model clearly concludes "NO, East Drive over the Loch is not located
        north of Johnson Houses Building 9."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Johnson Houses Building 9
        is located north of East Drive over the Loch" - indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model gives the reason for its NO answer as
        Johnson Houses being further north (at higher street numbers) than East Drive
        over the Loch.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, East Drive over the
        Loch is not located north of Johnson Houses Building 9." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating "Rather,
        Johnson Houses Building 9 is north of East Drive over the Loch." The model
        is indicating that the locations have different positions relative to each
        other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, East Drive over the
        Loch is NOT located north of Johnson Houses Building 9." This is a clear negative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "East Drive over the Loch appears
        to be approximately at the same latitude or slightly north of Johnson Houses
        Building 9" and then concludes with "NO". The model is suggesting that the
        locations are either at the same latitude or with East Drive being slightly
        north, which contradicts the final NO answer. However, since the model mentions
        "slightly north" as a possibility, it's not clearly stating the values are
        exactly equal as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that East Drive over the Loch is not
        north of Johnson Houses Building 9.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Johnson Houses are located north of the northern section of Central
        Park where East Drive crosses over The Loch." This indicates a geographical
        difference (one location being north of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that East Drive over the Loch is
        located south of Johnson Houses Building 9, indicating a directional difference.
        The model gives specific street numbers (East Drive over the Loch at 103rd-105th
        Street vs. Johnson Houses at 112th-115th Street) to show they are at different
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, East Drive over the
        Loch is NOT located north of Johnson Houses Building 9. It is located south
        of it." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Johnson Houses Building 9 is north of
        East Drive over the Loch" and explains that Johnson Houses is at higher street
        numbers (112th-115th Streets) than East Drive over the Loch (103rd-105th Streets).
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, East Drive over the
        Loch is NOT located north of Johnson Houses Building 9." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Johnson Houses (112th-115th
        Streets) is located north of East Drive over the Loch (approximately 102nd-105th
        Streets), indicating a clear difference in their north-south positions. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "East Drive over the
        Loch is NOT north of Johnson Houses" after analyzing the locations of both
        places.

        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "Long Island City is slightly
        more northern than Bayside" and "Ravenswood is slightly north of Bayside."
        The model gives a NO answer because it believes Ravenswood is actually slightly
        north of Bayside, not because they are at the same latitude.

        Ravenswood Projects is located" and that "Bayside would be further east and
        north compared to Long Island City/Ravenswood". The NO answer is based on
        directional differences, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference,
        stating that "Bayside is generally further north in Queens than Long Island
        City/Ravenswood." The model is giving a NO answer because it believes one
        location is further north than the other, not because they are at the same
        position.

        don't have sufficient information about these locations." This is not a definitive
        NO to the comparison itself, but rather a statement that the model cannot

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this NO is based on its "inability to confirm this relationship"
        rather than confirming a comparative result. The model is essentially saying
        it cannot determine the relative positions, which makes this an UNKNOWN response

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the
        church is north of the playground, indicating a directional difference. The
        model bases its NO answer on the relative geographic positions (church being
        north of the playground), not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, First Union Baptist
        Church in the Bronx is located north of Raoul Wallenberg Playground in Manhattan."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, though there appears
        to be a contradiction between the "NO" and the statement that follows it (which
        actually confirms a north-south relationship).

        that Yeshiva Hechal Moshe Beth Jacob is north of FDNY Academy Con Ed Transformer
        based on the information available to me." This indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information, not that it's making a comparative
        judgment that one is not north of the other. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that Staten Island is southwest of Brooklyn, and
        therefore W BRIGHTON I HOUSES BUILDING 1 would be south of YOUNG ISRAEL OF
        VANDERVEER PARK, not north of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model explicitly concludes that W BRIGHTON
        I HOUSES BUILDING 1 is not north of YOUNG ISRAEL OF VANDERVEER PARK.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that Staten Island (where W BRIGHTON I HOUSES BUILDING 1 is located) is south/southwest
        of Brooklyn (where YOUNG ISRAEL OF VANDERVEER PARK is located). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the question
        being asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        W BRIGHTON I HOUSES BUILDING 1 is south of YOUNG ISRAEL OF VANDERVEER PARK,
        indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model specifically
        states "It would be located south of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, W BRIGHTON I HOUSES
        BUILDING 1 in Staten Island is not located north of YOUNG ISRAEL OF VANDERVEER
        PARK in Brooklyn." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        for its NO answer, stating that W BRIGHTON I HOUSES BUILDING 1 is south of
        YOUNG ISRAEL OF VANDERVEER PARK (not north). The model is indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that W BRIGHTON I HOUSES

        based on typical campus layouts, suggesting the Student Center Annex would
        likely be more central while the Greenhouse would be more peripheral. The
        NO answer is not based on the locations being identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Student Center Annex is north of the Greenhouse. While the
        model acknowledges uncertainty about the exact positions, it still provides
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Gregory's Garden is south
        of Cypress Hills Library, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Gregory's Garden
        in Brooklyn is not located north of Cypress Hills Library in Brooklyn" as
        its final answer. This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded NO after determining that
        Gregory's Garden is north of Cypress Hills Library (stating "Jamaica Avenue
        is north of Sutter Avenue" and "Gregory's Garden on Jamaica Avenue would be
        north of Cypress Hills Library on Sutter Avenue"). The model identified a
        directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically that Staten Island is south of Brooklyn, so
        a location in Staten Island would be south of a location in Brooklyn, not
        north. The model is indicating a difference in geographic position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "BANCROFT AVENUE OVR

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it concluded "NO" based on its reasoning that
        BANCROFT AVENUE OVR SIRT S SHR in Staten Island would be south of LUNA PARK
        HOUSES in Brooklyn due to the geographic relationship between the boroughs.
        The model identified a directional difference (south vs. north) between the
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically that one location is south of the other, not
        north. The model is rejecting the premise that one location is north of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that BANCROFT AVENUE OVR

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, explaining that Bancroft Avenue (in Staten Island) is south
        of Luna Park Houses (in Brooklyn), not north of it. The model is making a
        geographical comparison where it finds the locations are in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that Staten Island is south of Brooklyn,
        and therefore Bancroft Avenue (in Staten Island) must be south of Luna Park
        Houses (in Brooklyn).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Bancroft Avenue

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Staten Island is entirely southwest of Brooklyn"
        and therefore "any location in Staten Island (including Bancroft Avenue) would
        be south of any location in Brooklyn (including Luna Park Houses)." The model
        is claiming a directional difference (south vs. north) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Bancroft Avenue over
        SIRT South Shore in Staten Island cannot be north of Luna Park Houses in Brooklyn"
        and ends with a clear "NO" response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it states that Grace St. Paul's is
        "likely around the same latitude as Cedar Hill, not definitively north of
        it" and mentions it could be "slightly north or south of it." This indicates
        potential small differences rather than exact equality, and the model is expressing
        uncertainty about the precise relative positions rather than asserting they
        are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Grace St. Paul's Lutheran
        Church is not definitively north of Cedar Hill.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        inability to make a determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, I don't have enough
        specific address information to definitively answer this question." This is
        a case where the model is indicating it cannot determine the answer due to
        insufficient information, not providing a comparative result. The model is
        essentially saying it cannot verify the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer with confidence" because it lacks the exact address information
        needed to make the determination. This indicates the model recognizes it cannot
        make the comparison with the information available.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        It states "I cannot give a confident YES or NO answer" and then says "If I
        had to estimate... I would say it's possibly YES, but this is not certain."
        This indicates uncertainty and a refusal to commit to a definitive answer.

        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it states "Grace St. Pauls Lutheran
        Church is likely located slightly north of or approximately at the same latitude
        as Cedar Hill." The inclusion of "slightly north of" indicates a potential
        difference in location, not equality. Since the model suggests there may be
        a slight difference in position (north of), this is not a case where the NO
        answer is based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        inability to make the determination due to insufficient data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - based on my knowledge,
        I cannot confirm that Grace St. Pauls Lutheran Church is north of Central
        Park Cedar Hill, as I don't have sufficient location data to make this determination."
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Labetti Post VFW is southeast of South Clove Road Cemetery, not north
        of it. The model identified a directional difference (southeast vs. north),
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that PHYLS ACADEMY is south of SUNSET PARK BATHHOUSE (not north of it). The
        model explicitly states that Bay Ridge (where PHYLS ACADEMY is located) is
        south of Sunset Park (where SUNSET PARK BATHHOUSE is located), indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether PHYLS ACADEMY is north of SUNSET PARK BATHHOUSE.
        The model provides reasoning that PHYLS ACADEMY is in Bay Ridge which is south
        of Sunset Park where SUNSET PARK BATHHOUSE is located, concluding with an
        explicit "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that Staten Island is south of Brooklyn,
        and therefore the College of Staten Island Observatory cannot be north of
        the school in Brooklyn. The model is indicating a directional difference (south
        vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether COLL OF SI OBSERVATORY is north of JHS 234 ARTHUR
        W CUNNINGHAM. The model provides reasoning based on the geographic locations
        of Staten Island and Brooklyn, concluding that "COLL OF SI OBSERVATORY in
        Staten Island cannot be north of JHS 234 ARTHUR W CUNNINGHAM in Brooklyn"
        and gives a definitive "NO" as the final answer.

        south of JHS 234 ARTHUR W CUNNINGHAM, indicating a directional difference.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what
        was asked (south rather than north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, COLL OF SI OBSERVATORY
        in Staten Island is not located north of JHS 234 ARTHUR W CUNNINGHAM in Brooklyn."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that Staten Island is southwest of Brooklyn, and therefore the College of
        Staten Island Observatory would be south of a school in Brooklyn. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different directional relationship,
        stating that "Brooklyn Excelsior Charter School is located northeast of Liberty
        Island." This indicates a directional difference rather than equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that the Brooklyn Excelsior Charter School is not located
        north of the Liberty Island Ferry Landing.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Moffat Street Community Garden is "primarily east (with a slight northern
        component)" of Gowanus Houses, not directly north of it. The model notes a
        directional difference (northeast vs. northwest positions), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Moffat Street Community
        Garden is not north of Gowanus Houses Building 8, but rather "primarily east
        (with a slight northern component)" of it.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it actually
        stated it couldn't determine the relative positions due to lack of specific
        location information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer. However, this contradicts
        its earlier statement that "I cannot provide a reliable YES or NO answer to
        this question." Due to this contradiction, and because the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination due to lack of specific coordinates or addresses,
        the appropriate classification is UNKNOWN.

        The NO answer appears to be based on inability to determine the relationship
        with certainty rather than on equality of positions.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lenox Hill Hospital
        Percy & Harold Uris Pavilion is not located north of St. Stephen Hungarian
        Church. It is located south of it." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different positions, with Lenox Hill Hospital being
        south of St. Stephen Hungarian Church (on 77th Street vs. 82nd Street). The
        model explicitly states "Since Lenox Hill Hospital is on a lower-numbered
        street (77th) than St. Stephen Hungarian Church (82nd), it is located south
        of the church, not north."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Lenox Hill Hospital
        is not north of St. Stephen Hungarian Church, but rather south of it, and
        explicitly concluded with "NO" at the end of its response.

        south of St. Stephen Hungarian Church (at East 77th Street vs. East 82nd Street).
        The model explicitly notes this difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of Lenox Hill Hospital and St. Stephen Hungarian
        Church. The model determined that Lenox Hill Hospital is south of St. Stephen
        Hungarian Church based on their street numbers.

        Hill Hospital is south of St. Stephen Hungarian Church." The NO answer appears
        to be rejecting some unstated proposition about the relative positions of
        these locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Trinity CME Methodist Church
        is "slightly northwest of Unity Plaza" - indicating a directional difference.
        The model's NO answer is based on this directional difference (northwest rather
        than directly north), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Trinity CME Methodist Church is north of Unity
        Plaza 17,24,25A Building 2. The model provides a clear comparative result
        after analyzing the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model stated that "Trinity CME Methodist
        Church would be positioned northwest relative to Unity Plaza" and that "Brownsville
        is generally located to the west and slightly north of East New York." The
        model's reasoning indicates a directional difference (northwest positioning),
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model went through a step-by-step analysis
        of the locations and concluded with a definitive "NO" to the question of whether
        Trinity CME Methodist Church is north of Unity Plaza 17,24,25A Building 2.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that
        the schools are in different locations - one in the northern Bronx and one
        in the southern Bronx. The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer. This
        is a clear negative response to the comparative question. The model then explains
        that The New School for Leadership and Journalism is located in the northern
        Bronx, while the Harry H Gordon School Annex is in the southern Bronx, concluding
        that the first school is north of the second.

        in the Baychester/Co-op City area is further north than THE NEW SCHOOL FOR
        LEADERSHIP AND JOURNALISM in Kingsbridge." The model identified a difference
        in their northern positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then reconsidered
        and stated "I cannot confidently determine the relative north-south positions
        of these two Bronx schools. I don't have sufficient geographical data to give
        a definitive YES or NO answer." This indicates the model is unable to make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes differences in their locations,
        stating that THE NEW SCHOOL FOR LEADERSHIP AND JOURNALISM is in Kingsbridge
        (northwest Bronx) while HARRY H GORDON SCHOOL ANNEX is in Baychester/Co-op
        City (northeast Bronx). The model concludes that the New School is south of
        the Harry H Gordon School, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the comparative question
        with a definitive NO after analyzing the locations of the two schools.

        AND JOURNALISM (W 231st St) is located north of the HARRY H GORDON SCHOOL
        ANNEX (near E 204th-205th St)." The model is indicating a difference in location,
        not equality. The NO answer appears to be because the comparison in the original
        question was stated in the opposite direction of what the model found to be
        true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        City (where Harry H Gordon School Annex is located) is actually further north
        than Kingsbridge (where The New School for Leadership and Journalism is located)."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether THE NEW SCHOOL FOR LEADERSHIP AND JOURNALISM is
        north of HARRY H GORDON SCHOOL ANNEX. The answer is clear and definitive.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one school is north
        of the other (Harry H Gordon School Annex is north of The New School for Leadership
        and Journalism). The model gives a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The New School for
        Leadership and Journalism is NOT north of Harry H Gordon School Annex. Rather,
        it is south of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but then explains
        that the question contains a false premise because Williamsburg is in Brooklyn,
        not Manhattan. This means the model is rejecting the premise of the question
        rather than making a comparative judgment, which qualifies as UNKNOWN according
        to the criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model rejects the premise of the question by stating that "Williamsburg
        is not located in Manhattan at all" and that "'WILLIAMSBURG, Manhattan' as
        specified in the question doesn't exist." Since the model is rejecting the
        premise of the question rather than making a comparative judgment, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but then explains
        that the question contains a false premise because "Williamsburg is not in
        Manhattan at all, but rather in Brooklyn." The model is rejecting the premise
        of the question by stating that "Williamsburg, Manhattan" does not exist,
        making the comparison impossible.

        the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a valid YES or NO answer because one
        of the locations specified (Williamsburg, Manhattan) does not appear to exist."
        This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        Street. The model concludes that "84th Street is south of 101st Street" and
        therefore PS 9 is south of Orwell House. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether PS 9 SARAH ANDERSON is located north of ORWELL
        HOUSE BUILDING. The model provides a step-by-step analysis comparing the street
        numbers (84th vs 101st) and concludes that PS 9 is south of Orwell House,

        School in South Jamaica, Queens is positioned northeast (more east than north)
        of Stroud Playground in Crown Heights, Brooklyn." The model is indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations, not equality. The NO answer
        appears to be in response to the original question about whether one location
        is north of the other (likely whether August Martin High School is directly
        north of Stroud Playground).

        are at similar latitudes, with August Martin possibly being slightly south."
        The model indicates there may be a slight difference (with August Martin being
        slightly south), which means it's not claiming equality as the reason for
        the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional analysis, concluding
        that "August Martin High School in South Jamaica, Queens is generally northeast
        of central Brooklyn locations like Crown Heights where Stroud Playground is
        located." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.

        (latitudes) are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says "South Jamaica
        in Queens is approximately at the same latitude or slightly south of Crown
        Heights in Brooklyn." This indicates either approximate equality OR that one
        location is slightly south of the other. Since it presents this as an either/or
        situation and doesn't definitively state they are equal as the reason for
        its NO answer, this doesn't meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct comparative answer to the question

        Bridge is in northeastern Queens which is "generally further north than Midtown
        Manhattan" where the Stein Senior Center is located. The model is indicating
        a difference in position (one is further north than the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Stein Senior Center
        in Manhattan is not located north of the Motor Parkway Pedestrian Bridge over
        Alley Park in Queens." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "the Queens Botanical Garden
        Administrative Building in Flushing, Queens is very likely north of the Haiti
        Consulate in Manhattan" which indicates a difference in position. The NO answer
        appears to contradict this reasoning, but the model is clearly stating there
        is a positional difference, not equality.
