    868d9fa8-bf06-4339-bed8-032c8b941360:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is south of
        the other ("it's clear that the Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station is
        south of the General Walker Hotel"). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the power station is north of the hotel, after analyzing
        their relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its
        final answer, stating "Based on this reasoning, the answer to whether Walchensee

    b850611f-5220-4027-9b7a-b5b7930b098d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes that they are in different locations
        (Germany vs Pennsylvania) and concludes NO because the power station is "northeast
        of" the hotel, not directly north. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based on its geographical
        analysis.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

    cda9c4e7-03fa-4321-849c-5583358cff62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted differences in position (Germany
        being east and north of Pennsylvania). The NO answer was based on these directional
        differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Germany being east and
        north of Pennsylvania) to support this conclusion.

    d2cfdb8c-d8a4-4d51-a0cc-2d110c04fb2a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this when the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying that
        Kochel am See is "east and slightly south of Ohiopyle." Since the NO answer
        is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as its conclusion after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes differences in their locations,
        concluding NO because Walchensee is south of the hotel's location, not because
        they are at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        stations are in different locations, with East India being "slightly north"
        of Royal Victoria. The model does not state that the stations are at equal
        positions - in fact, it explicitly notes a directional difference. Therefore,
        the NO is not due to equal values.

        they are in different positions, with Royal Victoria being in the southern
        part and East India being in the northern part of the Docklands. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the stations are at the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        the NO was given because the stations have a northeast-southwest orientation
        rather than a north-south one. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Royal Victoria is "to the east" of East India).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, indicating that Royal Victoria DLR station is
        not north of East India DLR station. The model explains this is because the
        stations have more of a northeast-southwest orientation rather than a north-south
        one.

        and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. The model
        does not indicate any north-south difference between the stations, even a

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "I would lean towards a NO"
        which is a tentative NO. However, earlier it states it's "challenging to determine

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the churches are "relatively
        close" and "not far apart", it does not explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same location or latitude. The NO answer appears to be based on the conclusion
        that one is not "significantly north" of the other, which still implies some
        difference in position, even if small. The model does not cite equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning ("likely not far
        apart", "would need a detailed map"). Since it provides a clear NO as its
        comparative conclusion, this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states they are in different areas and that one
        is south of the other. The NO is given because the Cathedral is determined
        to be south of the Trident Hotel, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        that the Cathedral is south of the Trident Hotel.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position,
        stating "the cathedral is in Colaba, which is slightly south of Nariman Point."
        Since it indicates a directional difference (even if described as "slightly"),
        this cannot be classified as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions (Cathedral in central Fort area, Trident Hotel at southern tip)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it's
        not because the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that one location is south of the other (Cathedral is in Colaba which is south
        of Nariman Point where the Trident Hotel is located). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the two locations. The answer is definitive and based on geographical
        analysis.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Nariman Point (where Trident
        Hotel is) is further north than Colaba (where the Cathedral is). The NO answer
        is given because the Cathedral is south of the hotel, not because the locations
        are at the same position.

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Cathedral
        is south of the Trident Hotel (opposite direction from what was asked), indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the Cathedral is north of the Trident Hotel. The answer

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with one being south of the other. The NO answer is given because one location
        is determined to be south of the other, not because they are at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        noting that the Cathedral is "more towards the south" than the Trident Hotel.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never gave a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we can't provide a definitive
        answer" and indicates it "could be YES or NO, depending on where the rocket

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes or have the same north-south position. Instead, it indicates
        there is a difference ("not significantly north"), suggesting some difference
        exists, even if small. The NO answer is based on insufficient northward positioning
        rather than equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that Stasiun
        Peluncuran Roket is south of Gelora Delta Stadium, indicating a difference
        in position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the locations are "roughly at
        the same latitude" and uses this as part of its reasoning for the NO answer.
        The equal latitude appears to be the primary basis for concluding NO, as it
        directly addresses the north-south comparison being asked about.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about their relative positions
        and suggests a "NO" based on "general geographical knowledge of Java's narrow
        shape." Since equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, despite expressing uncertainty earlier. Since it

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that "Sidoarjo being slightly north of Pameungpeuk."
        Since it identifies a difference in position (even if slight), this is not
        a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

        oriented east-west with "some slight north-south variation" and bases its
        NO answer on the general orientation of the island and the relative positions
        of West Java and East Java. The NO answer is not based on the locations being
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Based on these

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they could be "on the same
        latitude," this is presented as one possibility alongside being "slightly
        to the west." The model's NO answer is primarily based on geographical analysis
        rather than explicitly stating the locations are at the same latitude. The
        model does not definitively state they are equal in latitude as the main reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one is "in the southern part
        of Haarlem" while the other is "more centrally located" - indicating a difference
        in positions, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that the Cathedral of St. Bavo is
        not north of the Ronde Lutherse Kerk.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model also clearly indicated
        a directional difference between the locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in bold, after concluding that the Cathedral of St Bavo is "generally west

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more detailed information to make
        the determination. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient data.

        reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - instead it stated it couldn't
        determine the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's not possible to
        provide a definite YES or NO answer" and concludes with "UNDETERMINED". This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information
        about one of the locations.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the reasoning given.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that the comparison is "UNDETERMINABLE"
        because it cannot determine the location of 54 University Avenue. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification since the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have enough information
        to answer this question" and explains that it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient location information for 54 University Avenue. This is a clear
        refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or at the same latitude. Instead, it provides reasoning about their different
        positions, concluding that 54 University Avenue is "not sufficiently north"
        compared to Inya Lake. The NO answer is based on a difference in positions,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

    542dcbc6-90fb-471c-919a-eb9d937ab3c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response does
        not indicate equal values as the reason for its conclusion - it states inability
        to determine the relative positions due to incomplete location information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning indicates
        it cannot determine the relative positions due to insufficient information
        about 54 University Avenue's location. This is effectively stating "NO, I
        cannot determine" which meets the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its response, even though it expressed some uncertainty in its
        reasoning.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relationship due
        to insufficient information about the location of 54 University Avenue. This
        indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or a clear
        YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the church is southeast of the lake), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly identifies a directional difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the church is) is in southern China and is "highly unlikely" to be north of
        Missouri (where the lake is). The reasoning is based on a difference in positions,
        not equality.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are different, with Muttukadu
        boat house being "south and east" of Milagres Church. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are at the same latitude or equally north/south.
        Instead, it explains that Muttukadu is "more to the east" and "not directly
        north" of Mangalore. The NO answer is based on directional differences, not
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        its NO answer based on reasoning that Muttukadu is "not significantly north
        of" Milagres Church, implying some difference in position. The NO is based
        on comparative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer...

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, noting that Chennai (where Muttukadu boat house is located) is
        "northeast" and "more to the east" relative to Mangalore, not directly north.
        This difference in position is the reason for the NO answer.

        but concludes NO for other reasons. The model's NO is based on its geographical
        analysis rather than equality of positions.

        Instead, it states it cannot determine their relative positions and notes
        they are in the same city but could still have different positions within
        that city. The NO appears to be based on inability to verify rather than equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though its reasoning suggests it cannot actually determine the relative positions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot definitively determine
        the direction between the churches due to lack of specific location information,
        but then provides "NO" as a "tentative answer based on general assumptions".
        Since the model explicitly indicates it "can't say for certain" and lacks
        the necessary information to make the comparison, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end, as it's effectively stating it cannot
        determine the answer.

        are in the same general area but not at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response initially indicates difficulty
        giving a definitive answer, it concludes with "The answer, therefore, leans
        towards NO". However, this is not a clear, explicit NO - the model hedges
        with "leans towards" and earlier states "it's difficult to give a definitive
        YES or NO answer". This uncertainty and lack of definitive answer makes this
        an UNKNOWN.

        is "slightly north of Princes Street, where the Balmoral Hotel is situated,"
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is given because the Balmoral
        is actually south of St Andrew's House, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions

        Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that the Black House
        could be located anywhere in Lviv, including in the Old Town itself, making
        it impossible for the Old Town to be specifically north of it.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because one
        location (Black House) is contained within the other location (Old Town),
        making the proposed directional relationship impossible. The model does not
        state that the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final conclusion

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that the Black House
        is "within" the Old Town, indicating a specific spatial relationship rather
        than equality. The reason for NO is that one location contains the other,
        not that they are the same.

        the Black House is contained within the Old Town area, making a directional
        comparison invalid. The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional response. The NO is based on the

        is based on the likelihood of precise north-south alignment rather than the
        locations being in the same place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Old Town is located north of Black House. While the model
        expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "likely to be NO" which is
        not a definitive NO, and indicates uncertainty in the comparison. The model
        also states it's "unlikely" there would be significant differences, suggesting
        it cannot make a clear determination. This type of uncertain/hedged response

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        equal latitude or have the same north/south position. Instead, it explicitly
        states there is a difference, saying Lake Moondarra is "west and slightly
        south of Collinsville Power Station." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Based on these steps, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        Lake Moondarra is southwest of Collinsville Power Station, not because the
        locations are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (southwest), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions
        it identified.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        gave a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDETERMINED"
        and explains it cannot make a definitive determination due to lack of precise
        location information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply couldn't make a definitive comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "LIKELY YES, but without
        a specific point on RM Williams Way to compare to, we can't provide an absolute
        YES or NO answer." This indicates uncertainty and inability to make a definitive
        comparison, qualifying as UNKNOWN since no clear YES/NO answer is provided.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be UNKNOWN"
        and explains it cannot determine the relative positions due to insufficient
        information about RM Williams Way's location. This is a clear case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that one
        location is south of the other. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it says they are "in close proximity" and "unlikely
        that one is significantly north of the other." This suggests they may have
        different positions, even if close together. The NO is based on the reasoning
        that significant difference is unlikely, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        churches are in different locations (one east of the other), not because they
        are at the same location. The model explicitly states "Our Lady and the English
        Martyrs Church is east of Little St Mary's" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, based on finding that the first church is east (not north) of the
        second church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one church is in the southern
        part of Cambridge while the other is closer to the city center, indicating
        different positions. The NO was based on their different relative positions,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church is north of Little
        St Mary's, Cambridge. This was a clear comparative result.

        to be at approximately the same latitude," this is irrelevant since the final
        answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "INCONCLUSIVE"

        in positions, with St Mary's Church being more central in Staffordshire while
        Hoar Cross Hall is in the south of Staffordshire.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that Hoar Cross Hall is not north of St Mary's Church

        but then specifically concludes NO based on one being in "northeastern" Kazakhstan
        versus "southern" England, implying a difference in position. Since it indicates
        a directional difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer,
        this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        is "likely minimal," it does not explicitly state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. In fact, it acknowledges there could be some difference
        ("challenging to determine whether one cathedral is definitively north or

        made a determination about equal values - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDETERMINED"
        and explains that it cannot make a definitive determination without more specific

        Pine Street). The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        together ("unlikely that one is significantly north of the other"), it does
        not explicitly state they are at the same latitude or exactly equal in position.
        Instead, it suggests that the distances are too small to establish a clear
        north-south relationship, which is different from stating they are at equal

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that Santorini is "to the east and across the Atlantic
        Ocean" rather than north of California.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other, not because they are at equal positions. The
        model explicitly states "Santorini is in the southern part of Greece, it's
        unlikely to be north of California" and concludes it is "likely to be south
        of San Clemente Dam." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that Big Pink is located southeast of Skokie Lagoons, indicating a
        difference in position. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis. The
        model concludes that Big Pink is southeast of, not north of, Skokie Lagoons.

        Residence is south of Sir Roden Cutler VC Memorial Interchange, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer was
        based on this difference in position, not on equality.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equality or differences in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "MAYBE" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that "Central United Methodist Church (Manila) is located south
        of Centennial Tower." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are close to
        each other ("not significantly north or south of each other"), it does not
        explicitly state they are at exactly the same latitude or that equality is
        the reason for the NO answer. The model actually indicates uncertainty about
        their exact relative positions, making this a NO for other reasons.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. In fact, it explicitly described
        different locations (Ermita vs. Makati) and gave directional differences in
        its analysis. The NO answer was not based on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model concludes with "the answer to whether Central
        United Methodist Church (Manila) is located north of Centennial Tower (Philippines)
        is: NO". However, this appears to be an error in logic since the model''s
        own analysis shows that the church (in Ermita) is north of the tower (in Makati).
        Despite this contradiction, we must evaluate based on the explicit final answer
        given.'

        locations were exactly equal - it just indicated uncertainty about their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it says it "can't determine their exact locations" and
        concludes NO because it's "unlikely that one would be significantly north
        of the other." This is not an equality-based NO answer.

        give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were the reason
        for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "MAYBE" and states
        it cannot determine the north-south relationship without more specific information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNDETERMINED" and explains
        it cannot determine the relative positions without more specific information

        - it explicitly states that Wood Green is south of Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay.
        The model does not indicate the locations are at the same latitude or equal
        in any way. Rather, it describes a clear directional difference between their
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Wood Green tube station is located north of Tidal Lagoon
        Swansea Bay. The answer is clearly stated and provides a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (one
        is northeast of the other). The NO is because the relationship is "northeast"
        rather than "directly north"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Wood Green tube station is not directly north of Tidal
        Lagoon Swansea Bay (but rather northeast)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sudbrook Park is "south and
        slightly west of Tulse Hill railway station" - indicating a difference in
        position, even if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same. Rather, it concludes NO because Sudbrook Park
        is described as being to the west of Tulse Hill (indicating a different position).
        The model never states the locations are equal or the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with Sudbrook Park being south of Tulse Hill railway station. The
        NO is because one location is south of the other, not because they are at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        that "London is slightly north of Cardiff" and that they are "not directly
        north-south aligned." The NO answer is given because London is actually north
        of Cardiff, not because the locations are equal.

        state they are at the exact same location or latitude. Instead, it says it's
        "unlikely that one is significantly north or south of the other" - which implies
        there could be some difference. The NO answer appears to be based on the lack
        of significant difference rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it bases this on limited information and uncertainty. Since

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the Monash Freeway is in the southeastern
        suburbs while Thomson Dam is east of the city, and concludes NO because the
        freeway is "not necessarily north" of the dam. The NO answer is based on relative
        positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

        Instead, it specifically notes differences in position, stating that Monash
        Freeway is "south and west" of the Thomson Dam region. The NO answer is based
        on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the locations were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there is a
        difference in position, with the Monash Freeway being south of the Thomson
        Dam. The NO answer was given because the model concluded the Freeway is south
        (not north) of the Dam.

        that Monash Freeway is "to the west and slightly south" of the area where
        Thomson Dam is located. This difference in position, even though described
        as "slightly" south, means the NO answer was not due to equal values.

        it indicates that Melbourne (where the Monash Freeway is) is "generally south
        of the Gippsland region" where the Thomson Dam is located. The NO is based
        on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to

        or the same - instead, it indicates they are in different positions relative
        to each other (Monash Freeway in southern Melbourne, Thomson Dam to the east).
        The NO answer is based on their different relative positions, not because
        they are at the same location.

        Disco was north of the Starwood. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates they are at different addresses and expresses
        uncertainty about their relative positions, noting they are "in close proximity"
        but still different. The NO answer appears to be given due to inability to
        verify the northern position rather than due to equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the
        model expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive
        NO as its comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the theaters are at
        the same location. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that "the Stephen Joseph Theatre is located south of the former location
        of the Futurist Theatre." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the relative positions of the two theaters.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of the
        model's discussion about the theaters being in the same town.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "We cannot determine the answer
        with the provided information" and explains that without more specific location
        details, it cannot determine the north-south relationship between the theaters.
        This is a clear indication that the model cannot make the comparison.

      result: UNKNOWN
    5f814aad-ce0f-41d7-be73-2bd62536b522:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning indicates
        it cannot determine the relative positions ("it's not possible to definitively
        say"). This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        "at approximately the same latitude," it doesn't explicitly state they are
        exactly equal in position as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model
        indicates there could be "a small difference" and that it lacks exact coordinates
        to make a precise determination.

        that the Stephen Joseph Theatre is south of the Futurist Theatre, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the Stephen Joseph Theatre is located north of the
        Futurist Theatre. The answer is given as a direct comparative result, not
        as an inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both theaters are in the same
        town, it does not explicitly state they are at the same location or that equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. The model actually indicates uncertainty
        about their exact relative positions within the town, suggesting the NO is
        not based on proven equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it previously expressed uncertainty about the exact locations.
        Since it gave a clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot determine" or
        similar), this should be classified as NO.
