        in the same latitude range" and "at a similar latitude", it does not use this
        equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states NO because
        it cannot definitively determine that Hvalsey Church is north of the ship's
        location. Additionally, it mentions that Hvalsey Church is "just slightly
        north" at one point, indicating a small difference rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with the specific wording "Hence, the answer with the given general information

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference in location, stating that the
        Trident Hotel is "slightly north" of the area where the Cathedral is located.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this
        a clear NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other (indicating a difference in position), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states
        "Colaba is generally south of Nariman Point."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional reasoning that one location
        is south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Cathedral is south of the hotel, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Cathedral...is actually south of
        the Trident Hotel").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that the Cathedral is south of the Trident Hotel. This
        is an explicit NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9e547c54-f75c-4ab5-a279-6bba8e0e28cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Colaba (where the Cathedral
        is) is situated to the south of Nariman Point (where the Trident Hotel is),
        indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result stating that "the Cathedral of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with the Cathedral being south of the Trident Hotel. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

    ec9f4772-496c-46b5-87dd-da730e486c23:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (with the Cathedral being south of the hotel), not
        because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Cathedral is south of the Trident Hotel (opposite
        to what was asked in the original question). This is a direct comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO, this automatically
        classifies as False. The question of equal values is not relevant since we
        only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        though it includes caveats about assumptions. Since we're evaluating only
        what was explicitly stated, and the model gave a clear "YES" conclusion, this
        classifies as YES.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES." While there was some uncertainty in identifying the exact

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it actually stated it couldn't determine one location's
        position at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot determine the exact location
        of Stasiun Peluncuran Roket and notes its answer is "speculative." While it
        does say "NO," it immediately qualifies this with uncertainty and inability
        to make a definitive comparison without more information. This indicates it
        cannot actually make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, noting
        that "Pameungpeuk is southwest of Sidoarjo" and "it is not north." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions due to insufficient information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot determine this without
        additional information" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information about one location. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as per the criteria since it explicitly states it cannot determine/verify
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that one location is southwest
        of the other, which is a directional difference. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference (being southwest rather than north), not on the
        locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional conclusion that the rocket launch
        station is not north of the stadium, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty
        about which specific launch station is being referenced.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Hamilton Palace being south of Motherwell Cathedral. The
        NO is because the direction is opposite to what was asked (south instead of
        north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical

        "further west and north compared to Muttukadu." The model does not indicate
        the locations are equal or the same - it specifically notes a directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and explicitly
        concludes that "Muttukadu Boat House is not located north of Milagres Church."

        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Leytonstone is north of Brent Cross West, concluding
        that Leytonstone is south of Brent Cross West.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        saying Leytonstone is "more to the east and slightly to the south" compared
        to Brent Cross West. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly states "Leytonstone is located at a
        latitude that is slightly more south compared to Brent Cross." This difference
        in position, even though described as "slightly," means the NO answer is not
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Leytonstone tube
        station is not north of Brent Cross West railway station." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        compared to Brent Cross." Since the NO answer is based on a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an

        the difference is described as "slight", any stated difference means this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        the model indicates a specific spatial relationship where the Black House
        is on the "northern side of Rynok Square" within Old Town, implying a relative
        position difference. The NO answer is based on this spatial relationship,
        not on them being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        reaffirms this with "Old Town (Lviv) is not north of Black House, Lviv". This

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the locations are equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because Old
        Town encompasses the Black House (one is contained within the other), not
        because they are at the same location. The model describes a different spatial
        relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response about the relative positioning. The
        NO is based on a clear reasoning that Old Town encompasses the Black House
        rather than being north of it.

        its NO answer. Instead, it explains that the NO is because the Black House
        is contained within Old Town (a containment relationship, not an equality).
        The model never states that the locations are the same/equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its reasoning that Old
        Town cannot be north of Black House since Black House is part of Old Town.

        not indicate any directional difference between the locations, but rather
        states they are in the same place.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Old Town contains/surrounds the Black
        House ("Old Town encompasses this area" and "includes and surrounds it"),
        which is a different spatial relationship than equality. The NO answer is
        based on this containment relationship, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. The NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        based on the spatial relationship between the locations, not due to inability
        to determine or verify.

        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that
        the comparison doesn't make sense because Black House is contained within
        Old Town. The NO is based on this containment relationship rather than equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains that the comparison doesn't make straightforward sense
        (since Black House is within Old Town), it still provides NO as a definitive
        comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.

        are equal/identical. Rather, it explains that one location (Black House) is
        actually contained within the other location (Old Town). This containment
        relationship, not equality, is given as the reason for the NO answer.

        within the other (Old Town), making the comparison impossible in the way asked.
        This containment relationship, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion. The NO is given as a direct comparative result based

        relationship. The NO answer is based on this containment relationship, not
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion. The NO is given as a direct comparative result

        Pancras stations are located south of St. John's Wood station," indicating
        a directional difference. The NO answer is because the premise of the question
        (being north of the reference point) is false, not because the locations are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it notes that "Lord's tube station" doesn't exist and
        assumes St. John's Wood station instead. Since it proceeds with the comparison
        and gives a clear directional answer rather than rejecting the comparison

        in location. The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on

        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that the stations are
        in different locations, with Euston and St Pancras being south of St John's
        Wood Station. The NO answer appears to be because the premise of the question
        (is X north of Y) was false, not because the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it points out issues with the premise (no exact "Euston St Pancras
        station" or "Lord's tube station"), it still proceeds to make a geographical

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        one location is south of the other, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction
        of what was asked (south rather than north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Euston St Pancras
        railway station is not located north of Lord's tube station" as its final
        comparative conclusion. While the model notes there is no "Lord's tube station"
        specifically, it makes the comparison using St John's Wood station as a proxy

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not cite equality of values as a reason for its answer - it actually noted
        that the locations are different, with St John's Wood being further north
        than both Euston and St Pancras.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations. However, the model rejects the premises of
        the question by stating that "Euston St Pancras railway station" doesn't exist
        (it's actually two separate stations) and that there isn't a "Lord's tube
        station." When a model rejects the premises of the question, this should be

        and St Pancras are both located south of St John's Wood Station," indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was given
        because the relationship was opposite to what was asked (south instead of
        north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Euston St Pancras
        railway station is not located north of Lord's tube station" as its final
        answer. While the model notes that "Lord's tube station" doesn't exist and

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (being west-southwest instead of north), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" after
        explaining that The Crystal is west-southwest of Christian's Church rather
        than north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Hoar
        Cross Hall is "southeast of the town center where St Mary's Church is located."
        This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Hoar Cross Hall is not located north of St Mary's Church.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with Blake Hall being "to the east and
        slightly north-east" of Kings Langley Palace.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning for why Blake Hall
        is not north of Kings Langley Palace (stating it is "to the east and slightly
        north-east" instead).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Blake Hall is "east and slightly south of Kings Langley Palace". The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its own reasoning where it states "St. Benedictusberg

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        the same location or elevation. Instead, it determines NO based on their relative
        positions, stating that Morden is actually positioned to the north of Hampton
        Court. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Morden tube
        station is not located north of Hampton Court railway station." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the stations are at the same location or elevation. In fact, it explicitly
        states there is a difference in their positions, saying "Morden is further
        north compared to Hampton Court." The NO answer appears to contradict this
        reasoning, but we're not evaluating the logic - only whether equality was
        given as the reason for the NO answer, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Morden is north of Hampton Court. However, there appears to be
        a contradiction between this NO answer and the reasoning given in step 3,
        which states "Morden is further north compared to Hampton Court." Despite
        this contradiction, we must evaluate based on the explicit final answer given.

        are at the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Hampton Court
        is "north of Morden" and that "Morden tube station is located south of Hampton
        Court railway station." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (northwest vs north). Any directional difference, even if described
        as "slight," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that San Lorenzo is northwest rather than
        directly north of the Royal Palace.

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that San Lorenzo is "slightly northwest"
        of the Royal Palace, indicating a directional difference. Even though the
        difference might be small, any stated directional difference means this is
        not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that San Lorenzo is not directly

        - it explicitly states there is a difference in location, with the Lyric Theatre
        being on 43rd Street and Tower 49 being on 49th Street. The NO is because
        the Lyric Theatre is south of Tower 49, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "The Lyric Theatre is not located north of Tower
        49." This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Tower 49 is north
        of the Lyric Theatre (due to being on 49th Street vs 43rd Street), indicating
        a clear difference in location. The NO answer was given because one location
        is north of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Lyric
        Theatre is not located north of Tower 49" after comparing their locations.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the dams are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Inanda
        Dam is "south of Midmar Dam," indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer was given because Inanda Dam is south rather than north, not because
        they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the dams, determining that Inanda
        Dam is south of Midmar Dam rather than north.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Inanda
        Dam is south of Midmar Dam, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Inanda Dam is south of Midmar Dam. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question of whether Inanda Dam is north of Midmar
        Dam.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        Inanda Dam was determined to be southeast of Midmar Dam, indicating a clear
        directional difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Inanda Dam
        is southeast of Midmar Dam rather than north of it.
