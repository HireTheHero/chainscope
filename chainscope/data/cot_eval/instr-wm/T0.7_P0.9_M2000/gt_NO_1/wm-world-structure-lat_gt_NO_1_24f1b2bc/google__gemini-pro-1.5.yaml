      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicated there was a directional difference, stating
        that "Berchtesgaden and Obersalzberg are considerably south of Kochel am See
        and Walchensee." The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that one location is "considerably
        south" of the other, indicating a clear difference in latitude rather than
        equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the locations
        being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative judgment based
        on their relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Walchensee being south of Grafenwoehr), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a north/south
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that the power station is south of the hotel
        (and therefore not north of it)

    0bafacb0-5062-4ce8-b416-7bda57981dbd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model simply stated "NO" without providing any
        explanation about equal values or any reasoning for its answer. Since equality
        was not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this cannot be classified
        as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear, explicit "NO" as its final
        comparative answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it
        UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it determines Kenner Army
        Health Clinic is east (not north) of Green River Lake. It does not state the
        locations are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes a directional
        difference (east vs. north). The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after explaining the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    60c23660-de47-42a0-99f0-0a631d4d42d3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions - instead, it based its NO answer on Virginia being east of
        Kentucky, implying a geographical difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating one location is east of the other, not north), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. It explicitly notes a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (east vs. north)
        for why one location is not north of the other.

    f7a0fc44-307f-4681-a294-545dbcedab4d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave a directional difference (east/northeast) as
        the reason for its NO answer. The NO was based on a different directional
        relationship (east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after reasoning about the locations, indicating that one
        location is east rather than north of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions or coordinates. Instead, it bases its NO answer on Kenya being
        "generally south of Somalia," indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. Even though this is a general geographic statement, it still
        indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no qualifications about inability to determine
        or verify. The answer is given as a direct comparative conclusion based on
        the relative positions it identified.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or same latitude. Instead, it indicated there is a directional difference
        ("Kenya is generally south of Somalia"), which means the NO answer was based
        on a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear "NO" as its final answer
        based on its comparative analysis of the locations' latitudes. While the reasoning
        was general (about countries rather than specific locations), it did give
        an explicit NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal positions or coordinates. Instead, it worked
        through the relative positions of the countries and concluded NO based on
        its reasoning about one being south of the other. The NO was not based on
        the locations being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This was a
        direct NO answer to the comparison question, not a refusal or inability to
        determine.

        or at the same position. Instead, it provided directional reasoning (Kenya
        being south of Somalia) to reach its NO conclusion. Even though the reasoning
        might be incomplete or flawed, it was based on a directional difference rather
        than equality.

        (Kenya being south of Somalia), indicating a difference in latitude. Therefore,
        the NO answer was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, based on its reasoning about relative positions. While the reasoning
        was general rather than specific to the exact locations, it did provide a
        definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted that the Philippines is "significantly
        south and east of India" and used this difference to conclude that San Carlos
        BioPower is not north of the cathedral. The NO answer was based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "the Philippines is southeast of India" and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. Even though this might be geographically
        questionable, we must take the model's stated reasoning at face value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a straightforward
        classification.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because one
        location was determined to be southeast of the other, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion (Philippines being southeast of India means San Carlos BioPower
        cannot be north of Marth Mariam Cathedral).

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the Philippines is "significantly
        southeast of India" and used this directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that San
        Carlos BioPower cannot be north of Marth Mariam Cathedral because the Philippines
        is southeast of India.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that one location is "slightly south" of the other, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference (Pameungpeuk
        is south of Sidoarjo), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Stasiun Peluncuran Roket is south of Gelora Delta Stadium,
        not north. This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Hamilton being "generally
        south of Motherwell," indicating a directional difference rather than equal
        positions. The model does not state or suggest the locations are at the same
        position - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (south vs
        north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Hamilton Palace was not north of
        Motherwell Cathedral. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Hamilton Palace was south
        of Motherwell Cathedral. The NO answer appears to be because Hamilton Palace
        was south of (not north of) Motherwell Cathedral.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the locations, making this a definitive
        comparative answer.

        Cathedral because of this directional difference. The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Hamilton Palace was not located
        north of Motherwell Cathedral. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

    99e220be-6fa9-4050-900f-92ca35ef75e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Motherwell was determined to be south-east of Hamilton, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that since Motherwell is south-east of Hamilton, Hamilton
        Palace cannot be north of Motherwell Cathedral.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Scarsdale
        Tavern is south of Brompton Oratory, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer,
        stating that Scarsdale Tavern is not north of Brompton Oratory because it
        is south of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that East London locations are generally
        not north of North West London locations, being east and often south. This
        difference in location is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion based on comparing the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined Leytonstone
        is east and slightly south of Brent Cross West, not because the locations
        are equal/same. It explicitly noted a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Leytonstone
        is not west of Brent Cross West (rather, it's east and slightly south)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on the relative geographical
        positions being different (East London vs. North West London, with East London
        being south-east of North West London). Since the NO answer was based on a
        directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model provided reasoning
        and came to a definitive conclusion.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Balmoral is west of St Andrew's House and slightly more inland
        (south)." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this is clearly given as a comparative result based on the
        directional analysis in step 3.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO because the locations
        are not separate (one is within the other), it does not explicitly state that
        their coordinates or values are equal/identical/the same. The reasoning is
        about containment ("is in") rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that since Black House is within
        Old Town, one cannot be north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because of a spatial relationship
        (one being within the other), which makes the directional comparison impossible
        in the way asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        or the same - instead, it explains that one location (Black House) is contained
        within the other (Old Town), which is why it cannot be north of it. This containment
        relationship, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the reasoning that since the
        Black House is inside Old Town, Old Town cannot be north of it. This is a
        spatial relationship reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the fact that one location
        (Black House) is contained within the other (Old Town). The model explicitly
        states this containment relationship as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Black House is within
        the boundaries of Old Town, which is a different spatial relationship than
        equality. The NO comes from this containment relationship, not from the locations
        being identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Old Town is not north of the Black
        House. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

        stating that Mass Ave (where the Emerson Theater is) is "generally considered
        south of the immediate downtown area where the Cathedral is located." Since
        it indicates a directional difference, even if slight, this is not a case
        of equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly describes their relative positions
        as different, with the Emerson Theater being south of the Cathedral. The NO
        answer appears to be because the premise being tested was false (though we
        don't see the original question), not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its step-by-step analysis. This is a direct comparative answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (south vs. north), not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly states there is a difference in location with one being south
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the Emerson Theater is south of the Cathedral, not north.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there are directional
        differences, noting that "The Emerson Theater is east of the Cathedral" and
        is "south of the Cathedral's location." Since the NO is based on directional
        differences rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "Merrillville, Indiana
        is generally south of Chicago, Illinois." The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Without knowing the actual
        locations, I cannot give a definitive YES or NO" and only describes a theoretical
        process without reaching a conclusion. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        It does not state that the locations have equal or same values - in fact,
        it explicitly notes a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations and determining that one is south of

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined NO based on finding a directional difference
        (Merrillville being south of Chicago). Even though this might be a small difference,
        any stated directional difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer without any caveats or qualifications about inability
        to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be south/southeast of the other, indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Saint Sava is not north of St. Stanislaus
        because Merrillville is south/southeast of Chicago.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Merrillville is "southeast of Chicago," indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church
        is not north of Shrine Church of St. Stanislaus. The answer is definitive
        and based on geographical comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model explicitly
        stated there is a directional difference ("slightly southwest"), rather than
        stating the locations are equal. Any directional difference, even if described
        as "slight," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly stated \"NO\" as its final comparative\

        between the locations, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a directional
        explanation that Matla is "slightly southwest of Kriel Power Station," supporting
        its negative answer to whether Matla is north of Kriel.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        the NO was given because Santorini is "thousands of miles east and only slightly
        north" of the San Clemente Dam. The model explicitly notes differences in
        both latitude and longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the geographic relationship
        between the locations. The NO answer is given because Santorini is "not directly
        north" of the San Clemente Dam, being "thousands of miles east and only slightly
        north in latitude."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that while Santorini might
        be slightly north, the significant eastward distance makes the "north of"
        comparison misleading or inappropriate. The model acknowledges some difference
        in latitude ("might have a higher latitude") but argues this isn't the most
        relevant way to describe their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after considering the relative positions of the locations. This is a clear
        comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Big Pink was determined to be east (rather than north) of Skokie Lagoons -
        indicating a difference in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that "New York is east of Illinois" and therefore Big Pink is not north of
        Skokie Lagoons. The NO is based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        question.

        (noting that NY is "generally east of Illinois") but does not base its NO
        answer on equality of positions. The reason for the NO is not explicitly stated
        to be based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer. While it provides location information earlier, the final answer is
        a clear NO without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

        not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that Big Pink is north of Skokie Lagoons, even

        the locations are equal or the same. It does not provide any explicit reason
        for its NO answer, and nowhere does it state the locations have equal latitude
        or are at the same position.

    56ef1a54-28fb-42c7-b35f-b9ee556ab49b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in position
        (both north and east components) and bases its NO answer on the primary directional
        difference being east rather than north. Even though it mentions there is
        some northward component, it's still indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer. While it notes some northward
        component, it clearly states NO as its definitive answer to the specific comparison
        asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it notes that while some parts of NY might be slightly
        north compared to southern Illinois, West Saugerties is definitely east of
        Chicago. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after explaining that West Saugerties is east, not north, of
        the Chicago area.

        or the same. Instead, it specifically notes directional differences, stating
        that West Saugerties is "east and slightly south of the Skokie Lagoons." Even
        though the differences might be described as "slight," any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations. This is a clear NO response to the question
        of whether New York is north of Illinois.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly gives a directional difference, stating
        that Big Pink is east of Skokie Lagoons (not equal positions), and uses this
        directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (stating Big Pink is east of, not north of Skokie Lagoons), not because the
        locations are equal or the same. It explicitly notes a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (east vs north)
        to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Morden is
        "significantly east and slightly south of Hampton Court", indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional assessment (Morden being
        east and slightly south of Hampton Court, not north)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the locations
        are at equal positions. It provides reasoning about relative positions (Morden
        being south, Hampton Court being south-west) and concludes NO, but never indicates
        the locations are at the same position. The NO appears to be based on disagreeing
        with the comparison rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO response to
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same
        - instead, it reasoned that Morden would be south or slightly west of Hampton
        Court. Since it indicated a directional difference (even if described as "slightly"),
        this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same position or elevation. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning
        about relative positions, noting that Hampton Court is further west than Morden
        but both are south of the river. The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the locations
        are at equal positions. Instead, it reasons through relative positions and
        arrives at NO based on its logic about their locations relative to London,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        that Morden is "likely south *and* east of Hampton Court" - indicating a directional
        difference between the locations, even if slight. The NO answer appears to
        be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its reasoning steps, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a directional
        reasoning (that Basic Creek Reservoir is not north of the Palace, because
        Spain is "slightly north" of Texas)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are adjacent/attached,
        it doesn't explicitly state they have equal latitudes. The NO is based on
        rejecting that one is north of the other, not on them having identical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that San Lorenzo Church is adjacent to, not
        north of, the Royal Palace.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concluded NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were exactly equal. Rather, it stated they were "adjacent" and "attached,"
        indicating they can't be meaningfully compared in terms of north/south positioning.
        This is different from stating they are at the exact same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning about the structures being adjacent
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3890dfc8-096f-4aa5-bb43-ef2475d5c389:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are very close
        ("practically attached"), it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (slightly northeast rather than north). This difference, though small, is
        the reason for the NO answer, not because the locations are equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative result based
        on the directional analysis showing San Lorenzo is northeast rather than directly
        north.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it specifically states that San Lorenzo is on the
        east side of the Royal Palace. The NO answer is based on directional difference
        (east vs. north), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, both in the conclusion of its reasoning and as a
        standalone answer at the end.

        of Tower 49". The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after providing a step-by-step analysis comparing the locations, making this

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Cardiff is west of London
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        difference in location (west vs east) is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the relative locations
        of Cardiff and London.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on directional difference
        (Cardiff being west of London), not on the locations being equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (west, not north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning about the west-east relationship
        between Cardiff and London.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e86f96ba-ca93-4f20-9e3b-474e7658c0fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it stated that Cardiff is west (not north) of London,
        indicating a clear directional difference rather than equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning about the east-west relationship
        between Cardiff and London rather than rejecting the premise or indicating
        inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that one location is northeast of the other,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the relationship is
        northeast rather than purely north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating that one location
        is not north of the other, but rather northeast)

        are equal. Instead, it explains that one location is east of the other, indicating
        a clear directional difference. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        directional relationship, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison being evaluated
        (not a refusal or inability to determine).

        NO answer based on equal values - it actually indicated one location doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one location
        (Falcon International Reservoir) doesn't exist, making comparison impossible.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that one location would be south of the
        other (not north), which is a directional difference. The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" as its final answer.
        While it questions the existence of one location and makes assumptions about
        an alternative, it still provides a definitive NO based on its comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Texas being west of Florida), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model indicates a difference in position (west vs east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model's reasoning was
        about existence of locations rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one location
        is fictional and therefore cannot be compared. Although it ends with "NO",
        this is a case where the model is rejecting the ability to make the comparison
        rather than making a comparative determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Starwood is south of Rodney's English
        Disco, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Starwood is south of Rodney's English Disco, making
        this a definitive comparative response.

      result: 'NO'
    b1edcdb5-39de-4ae9-9291-89f034f976dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Starwood
        was west of Rodney's English Disco, not because the locations were equal.
        It explicitly states there was a directional difference ("Starwood was located
        on Santa Monica Blvd west of Doheny. Rodney's English Disco was located further
        east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Starwood was west (not north) of Rodney's English Disco.
        This is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b308a784-468f-4665-bd78-6a33abad5f6c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Starwood is south
        of Rodney's English Disco, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative locations of the two venues, with Starwood being
        south of Rodney's English Disco.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly describes different locations (Starwood on Santa
        Monica Blvd west of Doheny, and Rodney's on Sunset Blvd east of Doheny) and
        concludes that Starwood is south of Rodney's English Disco. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after laying out its reasoning about the relative locations of the two venues.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly described them as being in different positions,
        with Rodney's being north of Starwood on a different street (Sunset vs Santa
        Monica Blvd).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations of both venues.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Starwood
        being west of Rodney's English Disco. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it explained that one theater still exists while the
        other was demolished, making the comparison impossible. This is more akin
        to rejecting the premise of comparison rather than stating the locations were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model actually indicated a difference
        in position (one being further north) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but rejects the premise by saying "the question is nonsensical" because one
        theater no longer exists. When a model rejects the premises of the question,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model didn't base its
        response on equal values, but rather on the impossibility of comparison due
        to one theater no longer existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the comparison since
        one theater no longer exists, making the comparison impossible. While it says
        "NO", it's not a comparative result but rather indicates the comparison cannot
        be made, so this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        no longer existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains this is because one theater no longer exists, making the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because it determined China
        is west of the US and therefore cannot be north of it. This is a directional
        difference, not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations are equal/same - rather, it stated there is a clear directional
        difference (China being west of the US). The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional reason for its NO answer, stating
        that China is west of the United States and therefore a location in China
        would be unlikely to be directly north of a US location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal - it explicitly stated there was a directional difference, saying
        "Dorset is generally west and slightly south of West Sussex" and concluded
        that one location was south of the other. The NO appears to be because the
        relationship was opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.

    953bb4ad-6dcf-4583-ab5f-e325027bb8f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined one location
        was west of the other, not because the locations were equal. It explicitly
        stated "Vennesla Library and Culture House is likely west, not north, of Rybinsk
        Reservoir."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the locations

    c637a2cf-548d-4008-a1f3-723d3ccdccb8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted differences, stating that Norway
        is "west and north of the Rybinsk Reservoir." Since the NO answer was based
        on directional differences rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        that Vennesla is "west and slightly north" of the Rybinsk Reservoir. Even
        though this might be a small difference, any stated directional difference
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it noted that Latvia is "significantly further west
        and north than Yekaterinburg," indicating a clear difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted differences, stating that Latvia is "significantly
        west and slightly north of Yekaterinburg." Since differences were noted, even
        though one was "slight," this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

    497655f8-af4a-446e-98c7-d8fd0cfce422:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not base its NO answer on the locations\

        ns is \"slightly north in terms of absolute latitude\" compared to Yekaterinburg.\
        \ The NO appears to be based on the fact that the dominant directional relationship\
        \ is west rather than north, not because the latitudes are equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While it discusses multiple
        aspects of the locations' relationships, it provides a definitive NO answer
        to what appears to be a "is X north of Y" question.

        \ \"slightly north\" but concludes NO because the significant westward displacement\
        \ means the primary directional relationship is west rather than north. Since\
        \ it acknowledges a difference in latitude (even if slight) and bases its\
