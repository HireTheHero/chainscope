      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying the Cathedral is "south of" the Trident Hotel. Even though these might
        be close to each other, any directional difference means they're not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Cathedral is south
        while Trident is north). The NO is because the direction is opposite to what
        was being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Fairfax Community Church is positioned
        south of Truro Church, indicating a clear difference in location. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two churches, providing a definitive
        comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (one church is south of the other), which
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing specific geographic reasoning for
        why one location is south rather than north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the locations have equal values/positions. Instead, the NO was because one
        location (Black House) is contained within the other (Old Town), making a
        north/south comparison invalid. The model never stated they were at equal
        coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        the other. The model explicitly states "the Black House is within Old Town"
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        an equality relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal positions. Rather, it explained that the relationship
        is different - the Black House is contained within Old Town, not that they
        are at the same location. The NO is based on a different spatial relationship,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        explanation that Old Town is not located north of Black House, instead explaining

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because one location (Old Town) contains
        the other (Black House). The model explains that Old Town "surrounds" the
        Black House, making a strictly northern relationship impossible. This is a
        different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a logical explanation for why one location cannot be strictly
        north of the other since one contains the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a logical relationship
        (Old Town surrounds Black House, therefore cannot be exclusively north), not

        they are different - one is contained within the other.

        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion stating "NO, The Emerson Theater is not north of
        Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral" and again as "The answer is NO." This is
        a definitive comparative result.

        that one cathedral is south of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception is not north of the Cathedral
        Church of St. Paul (in fact stating it is south). This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different
        locations (one south, one north). The NO is because one location is south
        of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Central United Methodist Church is south of Centennial
        Tower, not north. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference in location (43rd vs 49th Street), not because the locations are
        the same. The model explicitly states that one location is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Lyric
        Theatre is south of Tower 49). The NO is because the relationship is in the
        opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that the Lyric Theatre is south of Tower 49,
        not north of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that the Lyric Theatre is south
        of Tower 49 (43rd St vs 49th St). The NO is based on one location being definitively
        south of the other, not on them being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(The
        Lyric Theatre is not north of Tower 49)" as its final comparative conclusion.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in street numbers (43 vs 49) and concluding one location is south of the other.
        It does not state the values are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly
        notes they are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "at almost the same latitude"
        and "essentially the same latitude" but also mentions "minimal difference."
        Since it acknowledges even a minimal difference exists, this doesn't qualify
        as stating they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides it as

        While it mentions "minor differences," this is in the context of explaining
        why neither can be definitively said to be north of the other, and the conclusion
        emphasizes their essential sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        Starwood was explicitly determined to be south of the English Disco, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its geographical analysis showing
        Starwood was south of, not north of, the English Disco.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (British Residency is south of Thevally Palace). The NO is based
        on the direction being opposite to what was apparently asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations,
        concluding that British Residency is south of Thevally Palace, not north.
