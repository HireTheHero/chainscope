        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("the power
        station is generally south of Villa Somalia").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states they are
        in different positions, with Villa Somalia being north of the Turkwel Hydroelectric
        Power Station.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Villa Somalia is north of the Turkwel Hydroelectric
        Power Station, making the comparison directionally clear.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being south of the other), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states that the Turkwel station would
        be south of Villa Somalia, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and indicates
        the locations are "relatively close," it never explicitly states they are
        at the same location or have equal coordinates. In fact, it suggests there
        might be a difference based on street numbers and layout, just that it needs
        a map to be certain. The NO answer appears to be due to uncertainty rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final simplified
        answer, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        this clear NO answer as its conclusion, rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that the Trident Hotel is
        "slightly north" of the Cathedral, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is given because the Cathedral is south of the hotel, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Cathedral
        is "south or southwest of the Trident Hotel" - indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal in latitude. Instead, it describes them as being "in a similar area"
        and "comparable geographical position" but also mentions the cathedral as
        being "potentially being slightly south." Since it indicates a possible directional
        difference (even if slight), this doesn't qualify as equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that the Cathedral is not north of the Trident Hotel. This

        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that the Cathedral is
        south/southwest of the Trident Hotel, indicating a directional difference
        between their positions. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Colaba (where
        the cathedral is) is "south or southwest of Nariman Point" (where the hotel
        is). This indicates a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model emphasizes that the locations are
        close to each other, it does not state they are exactly equal in position.
        In fact, it discusses their relative positions in different areas (Colaba
        vs Nariman Point) and says they are "very close, likely within a few kilometers
        of each other." The NO answer is based on the unlikelihood of a significant
        northward difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though it adds a caveat about needing exact coordinates for absolute
        confirmation. Since it provides a clear NO answer based on its reasoning about
        the locations, this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the locations to make the
        comparison ("without specific details on the location... that can be directly
        compared"). This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it actually stated it couldn't determine their relative positions
        due to lack of data about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to insufficient location data for one of the facilities. Since
        the model states "it's not possible to definitively say" and gives NO because
        it cannot determine the relationship, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        to verify the positions, but still gives a NO answer. The NO is not based
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide
        a clear NO as its final comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to
        determine.

        so we don't need to evaluate whether equal values were involved.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "YES" after some
        reasoning, it heavily qualifies this as an "educated guess" based on assumptions
        about possible locations rather than definitive information. The model explicitly
        states it would "need to know the specific location" to provide a proper answer.
        This indicates uncertainty about the ability to make the comparison, making
        this an UNKNOWN response rather than a clear YES.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the actual relationship ("I
        cannot conclusively determine the location") and gives NO primarily because
        it lacks data to verify. This makes it a case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        that the address would be south of the lake, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Bulgaria (where
        Kozloduy is) is "south or southeast of Wisconsin" (where Sheboygan is), indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographic positions of both locations. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with one being southeast of the other. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Chennai (where
        Muttukadu boat house is located) is southeast of Mangalore (where Milagres
        Church is located), indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        as a direct comparative result, indicating that Muttukadu boat house is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mangalore is at a higher latitude
        than Chennai/Muttukadu, indicating a clear difference in positions. The NO
        answer is based on Mangalore being north of Muttukadu, not because of equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "Answer: NO" at the end of its response. This NO is given

        (one location being south of the other), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states that Muttukadu boat house is
        south of Milagres Church, indicating a clear difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical

        location is southeast of the other, not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference (Muttukadu being
        southeast of Milagres Church), which means the values are not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        there is a directional difference - specifically stating that Muttukadu boat
        house is "south (and slightly east)" of Milagres Church. The NO is not based
        on equal values, but rather on an identified directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Rome is "slightly more north (by a very small margin) than Chicago." Since
        the model identifies a directional difference (even if tiny), this does not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it explains that they are in
        different parts of London (northeast vs northwest) and that their relationship
        is more east-west than north-south. The NO answer is based on Leytonstone
        not being "directly north" of Brent Cross West, not because they are at the
        same latitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that the stations might be
        at "similar" latitudes, it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal.
        The model suggests Brent Cross West might be at a "similar or slightly higher
        latitude," indicating a potential difference. Since exact equality is not
        explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, and the model allows for
        slight differences, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model
        expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        similar latitudes is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason
        for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be YES"
        in its conclusion, even while noting the difference is marginal. The model
        commits to this answer despite expressing some uncertainty about the exact
        coordinates.

        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its analysis that Leytonstone
        is likely south of Brent Cross West, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        indicates it cannot determine the location of Lake Freeman and lacks information
        to make the comparison. The model essentially rejects the premise by suggesting
        Lake Freeman might not exist or might be a mistake. This makes it a case where

        locations were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, it clearly indicates it "cannot be definitively answered"
        and lacks information to make the comparison. The NO appears to be given reluctantly
        only because forced to give YES/NO. This makes it an UNKNOWN case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations. Since it provides
        a clear "NO" as what it calls a "placeholder answer", this counts as a NO
        final answer rather than UNKNOWN, as we're evaluating what was stated rather

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both power stations are
        near the town of Kriel, it never explicitly states they are at the same latitude
        or have equal north-south positions. Instead, it gives NO because it lacks
        sufficient data to verify the northern position, not because it determined
        they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While it expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does ultimately give a clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both stations are near the same
        town (Kriel), it does not explicitly state they are at the same latitude or
        exactly equal in position. The NO answer appears to be based on lack of evidence
        for a north-south difference rather than an explicit statement of equality.
        The model specifically notes "without explicit details on their north-south
        orientation" rather than claiming they are at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both power stations are
        near each other and in the same area (near the town of Kriel), it does not
        explicitly state they are at the exact same location or that equality is the
        reason for the NO answer. In fact, it mentions that Matla is "to the south
        or southwest of Kriel Power Station," indicating some directional difference
        exists, even if they are close to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it cannot confirm a northern direction
        from the available information, noting that being "near" doesn't imply any
        specific direction. The NO is based on lack of evidence for the northern position,
        not because the locations are equal.

        they are at the exact same latitude or have identical north-south positions.
        The NO answer appears to be given despite uncertainty about their relative
        positions rather than because of proven equality.

        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer. The
        response ends incomplete, but throughout the analysis, it emphasizes that
        it cannot determine the relative positions without more precise information
        ("requires precise information", "challenging to provide a definitive answer").

        is actually located south of the Kriel Power Station," indicating a difference
        in position. Therefore, while the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal.

        Instead, it explicitly states Lake Moondarra is "west and slightly north"
        of Collinsville Power Station, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is given because the location is northwest rather than directly north,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but the
        explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to lack of information ("it's not possible to definitively determine the
        position"). This makes it clear that the model is expressing inability to
        make the comparison rather than making a comparative determination, so this

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Our Lady and the
        English Martyrs Church is likely south of Little St Mary's Church, indicating
        a directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" as
        its final answer to whether Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church is located

        reasoning, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it suggests that Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church is on the outskirts
        towards the south, while Little St Mary's is closer to the city center, implying
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this perceived difference
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer. While it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning process,
        it does provide a clear directional conclusion rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine the relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explains that Blake Hall
        is northeast of London while Kings Langley is northwest, and concludes Blake
        Hall is "not north" of Kings Langley based on their relative positions. The
        NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality.

        equal latitude or the same distance north. Instead, it explains that Blake
        Hall is "not significantly more northerly than Kings Langley Palace" and bases
        its NO answer on relative geographical positioning, indicating there are differences
        in position even if slight.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to

        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it explains that Blake Hall would
        be "east or southeast of Kings Langley Palace, not strictly north" - indicating
        a directional difference, even if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "would generally
        be NO" as its final comparative answer. While it expresses some uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Uganda (where
        Isimba is) is "west and slightly north of Malaysia" and that it "cannot be
        directly north" because of the west-east difference. The NO answer is based
        on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion,
        providing this as a clear comparative result based on geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        positions, it does not state the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it concludes NO because it determines Istana Lama is definitely north of the
        equator while the power station is likely south of it, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Isimba Hydroelectric Power Station is located north of Istana Lama
        is generally NO". While it uses the word "generally" and discusses some uncertainty
        in the reasoning, it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

    f17d4742-df60-4b21-affc-a6017db9f913:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but the
        explanation makes it clear this is because it "cannot accurately determine
        the relative locations without more data." This is effectively stating it
        cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        the locations are identical or equal - in fact, the model implies there would
        be some relative positioning between them, just that it lacks the data to
        specify what that is.

        where the tower is located. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        relative positions due to missing information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" in a box, the reasoning
        leading up to it clearly indicates an inability to determine the answer due

        despite expressing uncertainty and caveats throughout. While it acknowledges
        lack of information, it still provides a definitive NO rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, it repeatedly emphasizes that it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to lack of specific location information. The model explicitly states
        "we cannot accurately determine the relative positions" and only provides
        "NO" as a forced guess when it feels compelled to give a yes/no answer. This
        indicates the model is actually expressing inability to make the comparison,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it cannot determine the exact geographical relationship and lacks sufficient
        information. The model indicates uncertainty throughout and only provides
        "NO" as a formality "for the sake of providing an answer." This makes it clear
        the model cannot actually make the determination.

        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explains their different
        addresses and relative positions on different boulevards (Santa Monica Blvd
        vs Sunset Blvd) to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on their
        different positions, not on them being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes they are on different streets (Sunset Boulevard
        vs Santa Monica Boulevard) and indicates a clear difference in position (one
        being south of the other). The NO answer is based on their relative positions,
        not because they are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        that Kollam (where Thevally Palace is) is north of Trivandrum (where the British
        Residency is), not because the locations are at the same position. The model
        explicitly identifies a directional difference between the locations.

    1b3ca7d9-0ba4-46e9-8bd5-ca9043c685d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it gives a directional explanation, stating that one location
        is south of the other (Trivandrum being south of Kollam), which is why it
        answers NO to whether British Residency is north of Thevally Palace. Even
        though there is uncertainty in the analysis, the NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" in bold at
        the end of its response after analyzing the locations, making this a clear
        negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with the British
        Residency being south of Thevally Palace. The NO is given because one location
        is south of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis
        that the British Residency is south of (not north of) Thevally Palace.

        (where the British Residency is). This difference in location is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed some uncertainty about exact
        locations, it did not state that the locations were equal or the same. Instead,
        it concluded NO based on its reasoning that one location was likely south
        of the other (indicating a difference in position, not equality). The NO answer
        was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a directional comparison based on its analysis of the locations.
        While it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states that Kollam (where Thevally Palace
        is) is north of Trivandrum (where the British Residency is). The NO answer
        is because their relative positions are different from what was asked in the
        question.

        locations. The NO is because one location is south of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the British Residency is located north of Thevally

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that
        one location (Thevally Palace in Kollam) is actually north of the other (British
        Residency, assumed to be in Trivandrum). The model identifies a difference
        in relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, after walking through its reasoning process. While it expresses some
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it does ultimately provide a clear NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying "Trivandrum (where the British Residency
        is located) is to the south of Kollam (where Thevally Palace is located)."
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that the British Residency is not located
        north of Thevally Palace. The model provides specific geographical reasoning,
        indicating that Trivandrum (British Residency) is to the south of Kollam (Thevally
        Palace).
