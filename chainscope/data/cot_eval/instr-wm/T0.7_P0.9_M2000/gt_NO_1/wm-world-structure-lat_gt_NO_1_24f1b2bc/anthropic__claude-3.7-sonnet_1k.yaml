        is "either at a similar latitude (if comparing to Kerala) or south of it (if
        comparing to Middle East locations)." Even when mentioning the Kerala possibility,
        it says "similar latitude" not "equal" and presents this as only one possibility.
        The primary reason for the NO is that San Carlos is not north of Marth Mariam
        Cathedral.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - San Carlos BioPower
        is not located north of Marth Mariam Cathedral." This is a clear negative

        latitude ranges" and that "without more specific coordinates for the cathedral,
        I cannot definitively state which is further north." The model is expressing
        uncertainty about which location is further north due to insufficient information,
        not claiming they are at the same latitude. The reason for the NO answer is
        lack of sufficient evidence, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it does not believe San Carlos BioPower is north
        of Marth Mariam Cathedral. The model provides a reason: "Based on available
        information, there isn''t sufficient evidence to conclude that San Carlos
        BioPower is north of Marth Mariam Cathedral." While the model expresses uncertainty
        about the exact locations, it still provides a definitive "NO" answer to the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question because I don't have sufficient information
        about one of the locations mentioned." The model indicates it cannot make

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the location of one of the entities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it cannot confirm the comparison because
        it lacks information about Old Moster Church's location. This indicates the
        model cannot make the determination rather than making a definitive comparative
        judgment. The model is essentially saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        inability to make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Lake Kubenskoye is north of Old Moster Church based on available geographical
        information." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot confirm"
        rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. The model is indicating
        it cannot determine the relative positions due to uncertainty about one of
        the locations.

        answer. It explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to whether Lake Kubenskoye is located north of it" due to lack of information
        about Old Moster Church's location. This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.

        as the reason for its NO answer, indicating that the values being compared
        (the latitudes) are approximately equal. This equality is presented as the
        primary reason for the NO answer.

        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - stating
        that "Euston and St Pancras railway stations are located south of Lord's/St.
        John's Wood tube station, not north of it." The model identified a difference
        in position (south vs. north), not an equality.

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model concludes that since Delhi (where
        Jahanpanah is located) has a higher latitude than Orlando, Jahanpanah is positioned
        farther north than Cathedral Church of St. Luke.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Orani Church is
        south of Immaculate Conception Parish Church, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one
        church is south of the other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that "Orani Church is NOT north of Immaculate
        Conception Parish Church in Santa Maria. It is actually south of it." This
        is a definitive comparative judgment with a clear NO answer.

        Instead, it provides a specific directional difference, stating "Santa Maria
        is slightly more north in terms of latitude." The model is indicating there
        is a difference in the north-south positioning, with Santa Maria being more
        northward than Orani, which is why the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Orani Church is not

        slightly north of Santa Maria, but the primary directional relationship is
        that Orani is west of Santa Maria." The model acknowledges a slight difference
        in north-south positioning (with Orani being slightly north) but gives NO
        because the primary directional relationship is west, not north. This is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Orani Church is not located north of Immaculate

        that "Both locations are at almost identical latitudes" and "they are essentially

        given for the NO answer. The model does mention "If anything, Dudley is very

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that San Lorenzo is
        positioned southwest of the Royal Palace, indicating a directional difference.
        The model's NO answer is based on this directional difference (San Lorenzo
        being south and west of the palace), not on any equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        as its final answer to whether San Lorenzo, Turin is located north of Royal
        Palace of Turin. The model explicitly concludes that since San Lorenzo is
        to the southwest of the Royal Palace, it cannot be north of it.

        are the same. Instead, it states that San Lorenzo is "positioned slightly
        northeast of the Royal Palace, but primarily to the east, not directly north."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (east/northeast rather than
        north), not equality of position. This directional difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "San Lorenzo is actually
        positioned slightly to the west of the Royal Palace, but they share approximately
        the same northern alignment. If anything, San Lorenzo is very slightly north
        of the southernmost parts of the Royal Palace complex." The model is noting
        differences in position, even if they are described as "slight" or "very slightly,"
        rather than stating they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after
        analyzing the relative positions of San Lorenzo and the Royal Palace of Turin.

        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that Tower
        49 is north of the Lyric Theatre (not that the Lyric Theatre is north of Tower
        49). The model explicitly states the locations are different (Lyric Theatre
        on 43rd Street and Tower 49 on 49th Street, "6 streets further north").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
