        (stating that Walchensee is south of the hotel), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Kansas is west of Kentucky). The NO answer is given because the
        model determines the relationship is west-east rather than north-south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that one location is west of the other), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Kansas being west of Kentucky.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    e509de8f-01aa-4e96-9f0d-010f4fcf616b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (being west rather than north), not because the locations are at the same

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never suggested
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO means it "cannot confidently confirm" the comparison. This makes
        it a case of being unable to determine/verify rather than a comparative NO,
        so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location being south of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with Kenner Army Health Clinic being SOUTH of Green River Lake.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES
        without specific location verification)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot
        verify the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative
        result.

        India station." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (south vs north), not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly states one station is south of the other, indicating different
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional reason (Royal Victoria being
        south, not north, of East India)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it states
        Royal Victoria is south of East India station, not because the stations are
        at the same location. It indicates a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about station locations.

    7da20d44-53b3-4a39-b7a9-dffd0fa47632:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        equal positions - instead, it explicitly states that East India station is
        "slightly north of Royal Victoria station", indicating a difference in position
        (even though slight). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result addressing the relative positions
        of the stations (with one being stated as slightly north of the other)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the stations
        being at equal positions - rather, it explicitly states that Royal Victoria
        is south of East India, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about uncertainty or inability to
        determine. The model directly addresses the comparison and provides a definitive
        negative response.

        - both in the conclusion of its step-by-step reasoning and as a final standalone
        answer. The model is making a definitive comparative statement about relative
        position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Royal Victoria being
        south of East India station, not because the stations are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Royal Victoria station
        is actually south of East India station"), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, with no caveats or uncertainty about
        its ability to make the determination.

        The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its final answer
        and explicitly states "Royal Victoria is NOT north of East India DLR station"
        in step 5. This is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it explicitly stated they were different (in different states)
        and that one was west of the other. The NO was given because being "west of"
        means it cannot be "north of"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing clear reasoning based on geographical location
        (west vs north relationship)

        or the same - instead, it notes they are in different states and "quite far"
        from each other. The NO answer appears to be based on the model's reasoning
        that the reservoir "cannot be definitively considered 'north'" rather than
        any equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" as its final

        simply concludes that John Redmond Reservoir is "NOT located north of The
        Green Building" without specifying if this is due to equality or being south.

        the same latitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it explicitly noted
        that John Redmond Reservoir is "west/southwest of Louisville," indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" answer to
        the comparative question, stating "NO. John Redmond Reservoir is not located
        north of The Green Building in Louisville, Kentucky." This is a direct comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it instead stated that the comparison
        was impossible because one location wasn't in Kentucky.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. However, since the model rejects the premise of the question by stating
        "the premise of the question is fundamentally incorrect" and explains that
        the comparison is impossible because the locations are in different states,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN according to the criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        the model determined the Cathedral was specifically south of the Trident Hotel,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that the Cathedral
        is south of the Trident Hotel (not north as asked in the question).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Cathedral is south of the hotel, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative location question, providing a directional
        reason (Cathedral is south, not north of the hotel)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating the Cathedral is south of the hotel), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly identifies a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        the Cathedral is south of the Trident Hotel, not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states "Colaba is south of Nariman Point" and concludes
        the Cathedral is south of the Trident Hotel. This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        to the question about relative location (not as a refusal or inability to
        determine).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that the Cathedral is SOUTH of
        the Trident Hotel, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that "The Cathedral is slightly west of Nariman Point" and "The Cathedral
        is actually located south of Trident Hotel." The NO answer is based on directional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, providing a clear

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" because it cannot verify the locations. This
        indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal to answer
        or a definitive comparative result.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "do[es] not have enough information to answer this question
        with certainty." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to
        lack of information.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the positioning. This is effectively stating
        it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a definitive NO comparative result.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient data to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confirm the positioning due to lack of data. This is
        effectively stating it cannot make the determination, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN criteria.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the relationship, rather than making a
        comparative conclusion. This is a case where the model is expressing inability
        to verify, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO answer.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine the
        answer with certainty" and then gives "NO" as its final answer. Since the

        the model's reasoning was about non-existence of one location, not about equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly rejects the premise since Motherwell
        Cathedral doesn't exist, making a true comparison impossible. While it does
        say "NO" at the end, it clearly states this is after noting the "technical
        impossibility of the question." This rejection of premises qualifies for an
        UNKNOWN classification per the guidelines.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Hamilton Palace would have been located south of Motherwell (indicating
        a difference in location), and uses this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, even though it notes that one of the locations (Motherwell
        Cathedral) doesn't exist. While this might suggest UNKNOWN would be appropriate,
        the model made a definitive directional comparison based on the towns' locations
        and gave an explicit NO answer.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Hamilton Palace is south of Motherwell
        Cathedral), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (Hamilton Palace being south of Motherwell Cathedral) to support this answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not cite equality as a reason - it actually indicated a directional difference
        (Hamilton being south of Motherwell) and rejected the premise about the cathedral's
        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and "The answer is
        NO" while also noting that one of the locations (Motherwell Cathedral) doesn't
        exist. Since the model rejects one of the premises by stating the cathedral
        doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        was given because the direction was opposite to what was asked (south instead
        of north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the buildings are at
        the same location - in fact, it explicitly states that the Cathedral is "slightly
        south" of the Ronde Lutherse Kerk, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are "quite far
        from each other" and gives a directional difference, saying that "Mangalore
        is north of Chennai/Tamil Nadu region." The NO is based on the opposite being
        true (Milagres Church is north of Muttukadu), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Muttukadu boat house is NOT

        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (Muttukadu is not north
        of Milagres Church because it is south of it).

        that the values being compared are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explained
        that the locations are in different states and that the comparison is not
        meaningful. The NO appears to be based on the premise being incorrect rather
        than any equality between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it notes issues with the comparison. Since it provides this clear
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

        that Booterstown is SOUTH of Rocksavage, not because the locations are at
        the same position. It explicitly states a difference in position, with one
        being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        to the geographical relationship question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (McCallum Theatre
        is northeast of Warner Grand Theatre). The NO is based on the reasoning that
        "northeast" is different from "directly north".

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical separation
        and relative positions (different continents), not because the locations are
        at the same latitude or position. It explicitly states there is a difference
        in position ("cannot be located north of") rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that
        they are "in completely different parts of the world" and that there is "no
        meaningful way" to make the comparison. The NO is not based on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it first explains why the comparison is difficult. Since it provides
        this clear NO answer (rather than refusing to answer), we should classify
        this as NO.

        Lake Lawtonka. The NO answer is given because one location is south of the
        other, not because they are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same latitude/position. Instead, the NO was based
        on their geographical separation and relative positions being different ("cannot
        be north of"). The model indicates a difference in position, not equality.

        distant locations. This is a different reason than equality for giving a NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations were at the same latitude - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively state whether
        the lake is north or south" due to insufficient information, but then gives
        "NO" as its answer. Since this NO appears to indicate inability to determine
        rather than a comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot determine the relationship due to insufficient information.

        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot verify" and

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after stating
        it cannot confirm the affirmative. However, since it explicitly states it
        "cannot definitively determine" the relationship and "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer," this indicates it cannot make the comparison. The NO is
        given only as a forced choice when unable to determine, making this an UNKNOWN
        situation.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot determine/verify the relationship, making this effectively
        a statement of inability to compare rather than a comparative result. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is due to uncertainty/inability to determine the relative positions.
        This makes it a case of "cannot determine" which should be classified as UNKNOWN
        per the instructions.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot answer the
        question" and "does not have enough information to answer." This is a clear
        refusal to make the comparison rather than stating it cannot verify (UNKNOWN)
        or giving a YES/NO answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't locate one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer this question with a definitive YES or
        NO." This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information
        about one of the locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO" and "does not have enough information to answer this question"
        because it lacks location data for Lake Freeman. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have sufficient verified
        information to confirm the location)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot
        verify/determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm the spatial relationship with certainty."
        This is effectively stating it cannot determine the comparison, which meets
        our criteria for UNKNOWN. The NO here is not a comparative result but rather
        an inability to verify.

        claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one location's
        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates it
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about Lake Freeman
        ("I cannot confidently answer"). This is effectively rejecting the premises
        of the question since one location cannot be verified. Per the guidelines,
        when a model rejects premises or indicates it cannot determine the answer,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Lord's tube station is north of Euston
        St Pancras railway station). The NO answer was based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its step-by-step analysis determining
        that Lord's tube station is north of Euston St Pancras railway station.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states Lord's is northwest of Euston
        St Pancras, indicating different positions. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides a direct comparative result based on relative positions,

        the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that Euston St Pancras is
        "south of Lord's tube station" - indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again in the final answer line. This is a clear comparative
        result stating that Euston St Pancras is not north of Lord's.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined there was a specific directional difference (Euston St Pancras
        is southeast of Lord's, not north of it).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative directional reasoning leading to that conclusion.
        The model determined that Euston St Pancras is southeast of Lord's tube station,
        therefore it cannot be north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same latitude/position. Instead, the NO was given
        because of their relative positions being different, with the model determining
        that Kaibab Lake is west of Buffavento Castle, not north of it.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        with "Jahanpanah is significantly south of the Cathedral Church" and "The
        Cathedral Church is north of Jahanpanah". The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        answer, and while it explains that the comparison isn't meaningful since the
        locations are in different cities, it still provides a definitive NO rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Hume Dam is explicitly stated to be south of Lake Mulwala (a directional difference),
        not north as asked in the question. Since the NO was based on a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the explanation and once as a final standalone answer. The model
        makes a clear directional comparison (stating Hume Dam is south of Lake Mulwala)
        and provides a definitive NO answer.

        one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains it cannot make the comparison due

        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it notes they are in different cities
        and regions, with Cardiff being west/southwest of London. The NO answer appears
        to be based on inability to determine the north relationship, not because
        of equal positions.

        on the locations being equal or the same - it's based on finding they have
        different positions relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the geographical analysis.
        This is a direct NO answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
