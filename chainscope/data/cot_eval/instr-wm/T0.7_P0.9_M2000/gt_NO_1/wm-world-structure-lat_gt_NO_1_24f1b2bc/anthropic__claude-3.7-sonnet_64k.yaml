        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "East India DLR
        station is slightly north of Royal Victoria DLR station," indicating a difference
        in their positions. The model is giving NO as an answer because it believes
        East India is north of Royal Victoria, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Royal Victoria DLR station located north of East India
        DLR station?" The model provides a definitive comparative judgment, explaining
        that "Royal Victoria DLR station is not located north of East India DLR station.

        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (Cathedral being south, not north, of the hotel).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Cathedral is
        south of the Trident Hotel, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model's reasoning is that Colaba (where the Cathedral is)
        is south of Nariman Point (where the Trident Hotel is), not that they are
        in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determines that the Cathedral of the Holy Name
        is not located north of Trident Hotel, Nariman Point. This is a direct and
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't determine
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation indicates that the model cannot confirm the comparison
        because it lacks information about the locations, not because it has determined
        that the comparison is false. The model states "I cannot confirm that Stasiun
        Peluncuran Roket is north of Gelora Delta Stadium based on available information."
        This indicates the model is rejecting the premise that it can make this determination,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model gave a NO answer
        because it determined it lacked sufficient geographic information to establish
        the relative positions of the two locations. The model explicitly states it
        cannot determine if one location is north of the other due to missing information,
        not because they have the same coordinates or are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model directly states "NO" as its final conclusion after
        reasoning that there is no inherent north-south relationship between rocket

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially stated "NO" but then immediately
        corrected itself to "I DON'T KNOW" and explained that it doesn't have sufficient

        degrees of latitude)" and "the Sheboygan facility has a slightly higher latitude
        value than the Kozloduy plant." The model gives NO because it found Sheboygan
        to be slightly further north, not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is NO" in its
        thinking process and concludes with "# Answer: NO" in its final response.

        being compared are equal or the same. Rather, the model explains that the
        Black House is contained within Old Town, making a directional relationship
        inappropriate. The model states "Old Town is not located north of the Black

        The reason for the NO answer is that their relationship is one of containment
        rather than directional positioning, not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that the
        Black House is located within Old Town, not because the values being compared
        are equal. The model explains that Old Town surrounds the Black House in all
        directions, not that they are at the same location or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explains that Old Town is not located north of Black House because
        the Black House is located within Old Town, making it impossible for Old Town
        to be strictly north of it.

        The reason for the NO answer is the containment relationship (one location
        is inside the other), not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Old Town (Lviv) is not
        located north of Black House, Lviv" in its conclusion. This is an explicit

        rather than equality. The model explicitly states "The Old Town is not directionally
        north of the Black House, but rather contains it."

        NO answer is that San Lorenzo is in a different direction (southwest) from
        the Royal Palace, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - San Lorenzo is not
        located north of the Royal Palace of Turin. It is actually southwest of the
        Palace." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that San Lorenzo and the Royal
        Palace are "roughly on the same latitude" and that they are "adjacent" to
        each other. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that San Lorenzo is
        to the west/northwest of the palace rather than north of it, not because the
        values are exactly equal. While the model mentions they are "approximately
        the same latitude," this is presented as part of the explanation for why San
        Lorenzo is west rather than north, not as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Based on this analysis,
        the answer is: NO" at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer
