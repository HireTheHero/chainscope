    26a645f8-68f0-4fb8-9e30-c8a5ead635fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        the same location or elevation. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Royal Victoria being south of East India, using Canning Town
        as a reference point. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Royal Victoria
        is south of East India, not north.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion based on equal values or any other
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it suggests at points that Royal Victoria
        "would be north" or "might be slightly more north," it continues to express
        uncertainty and presents alternatives throughout. The response ends mid-thought
        without providing a definitive answer.

        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thinking and in its formal answer section at
        the end.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the stations' positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows an extensive thought process trying
        to determine the relative positions of the stations, but never reaches a conclusion
        or provides a YES/NO answer. The model gets confused about the station locations
        and branches, continuously second-guessing itself without making a final comparative
        statement.

        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative result stating that Royal Victoria DLR station is very

        on a directional difference (Royal Victoria being south), not because of equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Royal
        Victoria is not north of East India, providing a specific directional relationship

        automatically receives a False classification according to the criteria. The
        equal values consideration only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" and confirms "Royal
        Victoria DLR station is located north of East India DLR station" in its final
        conclusion. The answer is clear and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a difference in position, stating
        that the cathedral is around 13th Street while the theater is on 10th Street,
        with the cathedral being north of the theater. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - specifically that the theater (at 10th St) is south of the cathedral (at
        ~13th St). The model does not state the locations are equal/identical/the
        same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that the theater is south of the cathedral based on their relative positions
        in Indianapolis's street grid system.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined the
        Emerson Theater is on 10th Street while the cathedral is near 13th Street,
        indicating different positions (not equal values). The model explicitly states
        the Emerson Theater "lies south of the cathedral" due to this difference in
        street numbers, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that the Emerson Theater
        is not north of the cathedral (it''s south)'

    c8dbcafd-f0d5-4a16-be74-ad1f8d09a274:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in location, with the Emerson Theater being south of the Cathedral (10 blocks
        vs 13 blocks north of Washington St). The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that the Emerson Theater is not north of the Cathedral.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        even in the model's reasoning where it temporarily concluded NO at one point,
        it was based on relative positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence.
        While the model works through various reasoning steps and finds conflicting
        information (address-based reasoning suggests NO while GPS coordinates suggest
        YES), it never arrives at a final explicit YES/NO answer. The response ends
        while still analyzing the situation.

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers multiple scenarios
        where the answer would be "NO" (e.g., "so answer would be NO"), it never commits

      explanation_equal_values: While the model had some uncertainty about station
        names and locations, its NO answer was based on finding that the locations
        are different - specifically that St John's Wood is north of Euston/St Pancras.
        The model never claimed the locations were at the same latitude or otherwise
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        (the assumed "Lord's tube station") is geographically north of Euston/St Pancras,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        was given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the stations
        (even though it questions the existence of "Lord's tube station"). The model

        Street being "further north." The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.

        The model's NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a directional
        reasoning, even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact identity of
        the Sugar Pine Reservoir. The model commits to a NO answer based on the relative

        the tower would be SOUTH of the reservoir (assuming the reservoir is in northern
        Tianjin), indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a comparative directional reasoning, even though it expresses
        uncertainty about the exact location of Sugar Pine Reservoir. The model commits

        the reason for a NO answer is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never

        the reasoning process doesn't change that the final NO answer is based on
        a claimed directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        identities and locations, it ultimately gives NO because it concludes the
        tower is south of the reservoir (in the city center) while the reservoir is
        in the north. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not because
        the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear comparative directional statement that the tower is not north of the
        reservoir. While the model shows uncertainty in its reasoning process, it
        ultimately commits to a definitive NO answer based on its final assumption
        about the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that one location is southwest of the other.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a directional explanation that St. Anthony's Shrine
        is southwest of Lake Gregory, not north. This is a clear comparative result.

        is southwest of the other, indicating a clear directional difference. The
        NO answer was based on the shrine being in a different direction (southwest)
        than what was asked (north).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" and clearly

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that they are in different positions
        within Piazza Castello, with the Royal Palace on the "northern edge" and San
        Lorenzo on the "western side". The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in street numbers (42nd vs 49th) and concluded that the Lyric Theatre is south
        of Tower 49. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in location, with the Lyric Theatre being south of Tower 49 (42nd Street vs
        49th Street). The NO is given because one location is definitively south of
        the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the relative

        are equal - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with the
        Lyric Theatre being on 42nd Street and Tower 49 being on 49th Street. The
        NO is because one location is definitively south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that the Lyric Theatre is not north of Tower 49 (it's south
        instead). This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        difference, with the Lyric Theatre being on 42nd Street and Tower 49 being
        on 49th Street, making one south of the other. The NO is because the Lyric
        is south of Tower 49, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that the Lyric Theatre is south
        of Tower 49 because 42nd Street is south of 49th Street.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal - it explicitly states that the Lyric Theatre
        is on 43rd Street while Tower 49 is on 49th Street, and uses this difference
        to conclude that the Lyric Theatre is south of Tower 49. The NO is based on
        a clear difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this as a comparative result, explaining that the Lyric Theatre is

        are at the same position. The model explicitly states that one location is
        south of the other, indicating a difference in their positions.

        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        values being compared were equal. Rather, the NO was given because one location
        (Maison Alcan) is in Montreal instead of Portland. The model never states
        that the locations are at the same coordinates or equal in any way - it actually
        states they're in different cities entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and reiterates
        this answer, stating that Maison Alcan is in Montreal, not Portland. While
        this is a rejection of the premise (one location doesn't exist in Portland),
        the model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative answer rather than
        indicating it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not base this on the locations being equal or the same. Instead, it bases
        the NO answer on being unable to verify Maison Alcan's existence in Portland
        and therefore being unable to confirm it's north of the Aladdin Theater. The
        model never claims the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide this
        as a definitive comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine the relationship. The NO is based on the premise that

        one location isn't present, not because the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Portland.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
