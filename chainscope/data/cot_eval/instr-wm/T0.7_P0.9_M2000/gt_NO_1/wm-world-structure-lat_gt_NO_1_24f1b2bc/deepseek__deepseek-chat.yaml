        of the other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that one church is southeast of the other. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox
        Church is not located north of Shrine Church of St. Stanislaus" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be southeast (and therefore south) of
        the other, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positioning. The answer is definitive and based on a specific directional
        comparison.

        because the locations have different positions, not because they're the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Rather, it indicates they are in vastly different geographic locations. The
        NO answer is based on the difficulty of making a meaningful north-south comparison
        across hemispheres, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Kaibab Lake is not located north

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Matla Power Station is "8 kilometers southeast" of Kriel Power Station, indicating
        a clear directional difference. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and explains
        that Matla Power Station is southeast of Kriel Power Station, not north of

        This difference in position, even though described as "slight," means they
        are not at the same latitude. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Matla Power Station is slightly south of Kriel
        Power Station, making this a definitive comparative result.

        ("slightly"), any stated directional difference means we must classify this
        as False
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Blake Hall is "slightly to the east" rather than directly north
        of Kings Langley Palace. This difference in position, even though described
        as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the

        parentheses that this is because it "cannot confirm this based on the available

        the answer, rather than making a comparative judgment. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are at different locations
        (different streets) with Starwood being south of Rodney Bingenheimer's English
        Disco. The NO is a comparative result indicating a specific directional relationship,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations of the two venues, making a clear directional
        determination that Starwood is south of Rodney Bingenheimer's English Disco.

        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different
        positions (British Residency to the west, Thevally Palace to the east). The
        NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the dams are
        at the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Midmar Dam is "west
        and slightly north of Inanda Dam" - indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is because Midmar Dam is north of Inanda Dam, not because they're at equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Inanda Dam is not north of Midmar
        Dam" because "Midmar Dam is north of Inanda Dam".

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position ("slightly north"), even though it considers this difference less
        significant than the eastward direction. Since any difference, even if described
        as "slight," means the values are not equal, this cannot be classified as
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. While it notes some northward position,
        it maintains its NO answer based on the primary direction being east.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different positions for the
        two dams, with Inanda Dam being "closer to the coast" and "to the southeast"
        of Midmar Dam. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or verify. The
        answer is given as a direct comparative result based on the relative positions
        of the dams.

    c688f926-bf74-4c69-afb1-72bd3ec07f77:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Inanda Dam is "generally south of Midmar Dam", not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between their
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Inanda Dam is not located

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states that Ballinalacken
        Castle is at a latitude that is further north than Wrexham, indicating a difference
        in their positions. The NO answer was given because Wrexham is south of Ballinalacken
        Castle, not because they are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive statement that "St Giles' Church, Wrexham
        is not located north of Ballinalacken Castle." The answer is given as a direct
        comparative result.

        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly identifies a directional
        difference between the locations.

        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (east vs north) to support this answer.
