      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Wisconsin is west
        of New York, and therefore Lac Courte Oreilles (in Wisconsin) must be west
        of Otsego Lake (in New York). The model is indicating a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Lac Courte Oreilles, WI located east of Otsego
        Lake (New York), NY?" The answer is direct and unambiguous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with Lake Harmony being east of Lake of the Arbuckles (or equivalently, Lake
        of the Arbuckles being west of Lake Harmony). The model gives a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lake of the Arbuckles, OK located east of Lake Harmony,
        PA?" The model provides a definitive comparative judgment, concluding that
        "Lake of the Arbuckles is located WEST of Lake Harmony, not east of it."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Grapevine Mountains
        in Nevada is west of Joe Pool Lake in Texas, indicating a directional difference.
        The model's reasoning is based on the geographic positions of Nevada and Texas,
        concluding that "any location in Nevada (including Grapevine Mountains) would
        be west of locations in Texas (including Joe Pool Lake), not east of them."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Grapevine Mountains, NV is located east of Joe Pool
