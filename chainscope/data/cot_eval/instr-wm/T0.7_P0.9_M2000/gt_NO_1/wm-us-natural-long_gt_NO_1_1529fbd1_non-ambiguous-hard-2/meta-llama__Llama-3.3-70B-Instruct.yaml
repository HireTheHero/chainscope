      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer, stating
        "Since Wisconsin (where Lac Courte Oreilles is) is west of New York (where
        Otsego Lake is), Lac Courte Oreilles, WI is not east of Otsego Lake, NY."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        as its final conclusion, clearly indicating a negative comparative result.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lac Courte Oreilles,
        WI is west of Otsego Lake, NY" which indicates a difference in location. The
        model's reasoning is that Wisconsin is west of New York, not that the locations
        have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lac Courte Oreilles, WI is located east of Otsego Lake, NY. The
        model makes a definitive comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Sabine Lake (TX) is west
        of Otis Reservoir (MA), indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model's reasoning is based on Texas being west of Massachusetts
        in US geography, not on the locations being equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that Sabine Lake
        (in Texas) is west of Otis Reservoir (in Massachusetts), not east of it. The
        model states "Given that Texas is west of Massachusetts, any location in Texas
        (like Sabine Lake) would be west of any location in Massachusetts (like Otis
        Reservoir)." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on the steps above,
        the answer to whether Sabine Lake, TX, is located east of Otis Reservoir,
        MA, is **NO**." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        stating that "Texas (and thus Sabine Lake) would be southwest of Massachusetts
        (and thus Otis Reservoir), not east." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (southwest vs. east) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer to whether Sabine Lake, TX, is located east of Otis Reservoir,

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Walker Lake is west of the Guadalupe
        Mountains, indicating a directional difference. The reason for the NO answer
        is that Walker Lake is west (not east) of Guadalupe Mountains.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Walker Lake (Nevada) is located east of Guadalupe Mountains (Texas).
        The model concludes that Walker Lake would be west, not east, of the Guadalupe
        Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Walker Lake is not east
        of Guadalupe Mountains because Nevada is west of Texas, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The model is stating there is a difference
        in longitude (with Walker Lake being west, not east), not that they have equal
        longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Walker Lake, Nevada is located east of Guadalupe
        Mountains, Texas. The model provides a clear comparative result with a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model stated NO because it determined
        that Borax Lake is west of Lake of the Woods (not east), based on their locations
        in Oregon and Minnesota respectively. The model explicitly states "Borax Lake
        is west of Lake of the Woods" as its reasoning, indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Nevada is west of Texas" and "Grapevine Mountains,
        NV, cannot be east of Joe Pool Lake, TX." The model is asserting a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        $\boxed{NO}$" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Nevada is to the
        west of Texas" and "Grapevine Mountains, NV is west of Joe Pool Lake, TX"
        - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Based on this step-by-step
        analysis, the answer to whether Grapevine Mountains, NV is located east of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Nevada (where Grapevine Mountains
        are) is west of Texas (where Joe Pool Lake is), and therefore Grapevine Mountains
        are not east of Joe Pool Lake. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Nevada is west of Texas" and "any location in
        Nevada (like the Grapevine Mountains) would be west of any location in Texas
        (like Joe Pool Lake)." The model is saying NO because one location is west
        of the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes "Grapevine Mountains, NV,
        is not east of Joe Pool Lake, TX. Therefore, the answer is: NO"'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Grapevine Mountains
        is west of Joe Pool Lake, indicating a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning is that Nevada is west of Texas, so Grapevine Mountains (in Nevada)
        would be west of Joe Pool Lake (in Texas). This is a clear directional difference,
        not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the question
        of whether Grapevine Mountains, NV is located east of Joe Pool Lake, TX. The
        model concludes that "Grapevine Mountains, NV is west of Joe Pool Lake, TX,
        not east."'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Nevada is west
        of Texas" and "Grapevine Mountains, NV, is west of Joe Pool Lake, TX, not
        east." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east),
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Grapevine Mountains, NV is located east of Joe Pool Lake, TX. The
        answer is direct and unambiguous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on the geographical
        reasoning that Nevada (where Grapevine Mountains are) is west of Texas (where
        Joe Pool Lake is), meaning Grapevine Mountains cannot be east of Joe Pool
        Lake. The model is asserting a directional difference, not equality.
