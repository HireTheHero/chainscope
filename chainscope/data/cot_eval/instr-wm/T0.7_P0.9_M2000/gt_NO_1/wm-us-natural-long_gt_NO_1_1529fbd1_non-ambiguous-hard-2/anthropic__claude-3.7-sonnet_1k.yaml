      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Newfoundland Mountains
        (in Utah) is west of Llano Uplift (in Texas), indicating a directional difference.
        The model's reasoning is that "Utah is entirely west of Texas" and therefore
        the Newfoundland Mountains "must be west (not east) of Llano Uplift."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Newfoundland Mountains, UT is not located east of Llano Uplift,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Haro Strait is west of
        the Sangre de Cristo Range, indicating a difference in their positions. The
        model specifically says "Haro Strait (in Washington) must be west of the Sangre
        de Cristo Range (in Colorado), not east of it." This shows the model is noting
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Haro Strait, WA is located east of Sangre de Cristo
        Range, CO. The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Grapevine Mountains
        are west of Joe Pool Lake, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after reasoning that Grapevine Mountains are west of Joe Pool Lake, not east
        as the question asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Grapevine Mountains
        is west of Joe Pool Lake, not east. The model states "the Grapevine Mountains
        must be west of Joe Pool Lake - not east" which indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Grapevine Mountains, NV located east of Joe Pool Lake,
        TX?" The answer is clear and direct.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Grapevine Mountains is west
        of Joe Pool Lake (not east), indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Grapevine Mountains, NV is not east of Joe Pool
        Lake, TX. The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Grapevine Mountains
        is west of Joe Pool Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location is west
        of the other, not that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Grapevine Mountains,
        NV is not located east of Joe Pool Lake, TX. It is located west of it." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
