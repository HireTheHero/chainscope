      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Waubesa is west of Lower Saranac Lake, not east of it. The model
        explicitly states "Lake Waubesa is NOT east of Lower Saranac Lake - it's west
        of it." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Waubesa is east of Lower Saranac Lake. The
        model clearly concludes "Therefore, Lake Waubesa is NOT east of Lower Saranac
        Lake - it's west of it" followed by "NO" as the final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        the locations have different values - specifically that Lake Waubesa is west
        of Lower Saranac Lake, not east. The model explicitly states "Wisconsin is
        west of New York" and concludes that Lake Waubesa "cannot be east of" Lower
        Saranac Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides reasoning that Lake Waubesa is in Wisconsin (west) and Lower Saranac
        Lake is in New York (east), concluding that Lake Waubesa cannot be east of
        Lower Saranac Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Red Lake in Minnesota must
        be west of Canandaigua Lake in New York, not east of it." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Red Lake in Minnesota is not east of Canandaigua
        Lake in New York. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        states "Lake of the Arbuckles would be west of Lake Harmony" and concludes
        that this is opposite of what the question asks (if Lake of the Arbuckles
        is east of Lake Harmony).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake of the Arbuckles is east of Lake Harmony.
        The model determined that Lake of the Arbuckles is west of Lake Harmony (not
        east), and therefore answered "NO" to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Grapevine Mountains are
        west of Joe Pool Lake (not east), indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Grapevine Mountains
        is west of Joe Pool Lake, indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not that they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Grapevine Mountains,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite directional relationship is true - it states that Grapevine
        Mountains is west of Joe Pool Lake, not east. The model identified a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Grapevine Mountains is not east of Joe Pool Lake, but rather
        west of it. This is a definitive comparative answer.
