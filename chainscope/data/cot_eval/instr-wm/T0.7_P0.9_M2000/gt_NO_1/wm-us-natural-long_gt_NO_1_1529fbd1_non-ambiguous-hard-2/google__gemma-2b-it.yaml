      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Lac Courte Oreilles,
        WI is located east of Otsego Lake (New York), NY" but does not explicitly
        state YES or NO as a final answer. While the model makes a comparative statement,
        it doesn't frame it as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c7b932ec-b927-4e1a-ad7e-26c834820af1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Lac Courte Oreilles, WI is
        located west of Otsego Lake (New York), NY," indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

    fac63b90-357d-40e5-ad5a-4bfd234d6c89:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the locations have equal values; it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to whether Lac Courte Oreilles, WI is located east of Otsego Lake
        (New York), NY. However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information ("The passage does not specify...").
        This is a case where the model says "NO" but means it cannot verify or determine
        the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values are equal. Instead, it states that Suisun Bay, CA is located west of
        Mosquito Range, CO, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Suisun
        Bay, CA is located west of Mosquito Range, CO." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that one location is west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES,
        Suisun Bay, CA is located east of Mosquito Range, CO." This is a clear YES
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8ddc09a9-aede-4728-b775-1bfcce2f6334:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Suisun Bay, CA is not located east of Mosquito Range, CO without indicating
        that they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model did
        not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Suisun
        Bay, CA is not located east of Mosquito Range, CO." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a YES answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a86e9d7a-ea20-42d5-9dd9-38fbe7362e91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Suisun Bay is in California and
        Mosquito Range is in Colorado, and concludes with "NO" based on this difference
        in location. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b50fca20-cab0-4773-b267-ee7cbf3d4a00:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Suisun Bay, CA is located west
        of Mosquito Range, CO, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model is asserting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Suisun Bay, CA is located west of Mosquito Range, CO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d6207124-ca0b-4214-baa4-53b1034c1b90:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that Suisun Bay is in California
        while Mosquito Range is in Colorado, and uses this difference in location
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e8e7d61c-1fbd-4ada-b148-c160eebc3e96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually indicating inability to determine
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when
        asked if Suisun Bay, CA is located east of Mosquito Range, CO. However, the
        model's reasoning is that "We cannot determine this from the context," which
        indicates it lacks information to make the comparison, not that it's making
        a definitive comparative judgment. This is a case where the model says "NO"
        but means "I cannot verify/determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ef39bcf0-e6fa-43a4-8da6-40ff2213d562:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Suisun Bay is in California while Mosquito Range is in Colorado. This
        indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    1453e7be-87b9-4801-8022-a42df983633b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that the Ouachita Mountains are in Arkansas while Mount
        Monroe is in New Hampshire. This indicates a geographical difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    580a6e07-4b16-4df4-b5a7-d1bfabebb375:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Ouachita Mountains and Mount Monroe are in different locations
        (Arkansas and New Hampshire respectively). This geographical difference is
        the reason for the NO answer, not any equality between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5b976bbb-8546-471f-82b9-c88a4480abc3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions: "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Ouachita Mountains,
        AR is located east of Mount Monroe, NH." This is a clear affirmative statement
        that Ouachita Mountains is east of Mount Monroe. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES" as a standalone answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct
        statement of the eastern location indicates a positive response to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    62158165-8488-4174-9933-13ae14a003b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ouachita Mountains,
        AR is located west of Mount Monroe, NH, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model is noting a difference in values (one
        is west of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Ouachita Mountains,
        AR is located west of Mount Monroe, NH. This is a definitive NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on different geographical locations - one being in the southern United States
        and the other in the northeastern United States. This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the "No" answer by
        explaining that the locations are in different parts of the United States
        (southwestern vs. northeastern).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Ouachita
        Mountains is in Arkansas while Mount Monroe is in New Hampshire (different
        locations). This is a difference in values, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kingsley Lake,
        FL is west of the Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes, ME, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The model is noting a difference in
        position, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that "the passage does not provide any information" to make
        the comparison. The NO is based on lack of information, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. While it mentions lack of information as the reason,
        it still provides a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather it stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information ("The passage does not provide any information
        about the location..."), which means this is actually a case where the model
        is indicating it cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Wrights
        Lake, CA is located west of Lake Sharpe, SD." This is a direct NO answer to
        the comparative question, indicating that one location is west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Wrights Lake, CA is located
        west of Lake Sharpe, SD, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is asserting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Wrights
        Lake, CA is located west of Lake Sharpe, SD." This is a direct NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO.
        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response indicates it cannot answer the
        question because it lacks information about the location of Wrights Lake,
        CA. The model doesn't provide a YES or NO answer, but rather states the question
        "cannot be answered" due to missing information. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ee33abb5-e47c-405d-9db6-5c2f542a72b4:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when
        asked if Wrights Lake, CA is located east of Lake Sharpe, SD. However, the
        model also states "We don't have enough information to determine this from
        the context" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        information. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN rather than NO, since the
        model is stating it cannot determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations of the lakes (one in California, one in South Dakota), implying
        a directional difference rather than equality. The model does not explicitly
        state that the longitudes are identical or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Wrights Lake is not located east of Lake
        Sharpe, SD. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

        the lakes are at the same longitude or in the same location. It simply stated
        that Alice Lake is not east of Lake Osakis without explaining that this is
        because they are at the same location. There is no mention of equality as
        the reason for the NO answer.

        to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated one location is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, confirming that "Walloon Lake, MI is located east of Mount
        Franklin (New Hampshire), NH."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Bear Lake is not east of Christmas
        Lake without explaining that this is because they have the same longitude
        or location. The model does not provide equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.

        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because Bristol Lake, CA and West Okoboji Lake, IA are located in
        different states." This is a refusal to provide a comparative answer, indicating
        the model believes it cannot make the comparison. The model does not provide

        being compared are equal. Instead, it claims that Bristol Lake, CA and West
        Okoboji Lake, IA are "in different countries" (which is factually incorrect
        since both are in the United States, but that's not relevant to our analysis).
        The model is asserting a difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Walker Lake is not east of Guadalupe Mountains without explaining that this
        is because they are in the same location or have equal coordinates. The model
        did not provide any reasoning about equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Walker
        Lake (Nevada), NV is not located east of Guadalupe Mountains, TX." This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Calapooya Mountains, OR is not located east of Luna Lake, AZ. It did not indicate
        that they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The NO answer
        was not based on equality of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Calapooya
        Mountains, OR is not located east of Luna Lake (Arizona), AZ." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Calapooya Mountains are not located east of Luna Lake (and that
        the Calapooya Mountains are in California, not Arizona). This is not an equality-based
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that Red Lake is in the western US while Canandaigua Lake is in
        the east-central US, implying they have different locations with Red Lake
        being west of Canandaigua Lake, not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Red Lake is located
        west of Canandaigua Lake, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship (west
        of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Red Lake (Minnesota) is located west of Canandaigua Lake, NY.

        of the question by stating that one location is not east of the other. The
        model does not provide a clear YES or NO as a comparative result, but rather
        explains why the comparison cannot be made as stated.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its response.
        However, the model is saying "NO" because it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information ("The provided context does not mention whether Cross

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer due to lack of information. Since the model did not give a NO answer,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, and
        explicitly states it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in location - one being in the western United States and the
        other in the central United States.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Little San Bernardino Mountains
        is in California and Lake Altus-Lugert is in Oklahoma, and concludes "NO"
        based on this difference in location. The model is not claiming equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Little San Bernardino
        Mountains, CA is located west of Lake Altus-Lugert, OK, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The model is noting a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Little San Bernardino Mountains, CA is located west of Lake

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Little San Bernardino Mountains, CA is not located east of Lake Altus-Lugert,
        OK, without mentioning equality as the reason. The model did not claim the
        locations have the same longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Little San Bernardino
        Mountains, CA is not located east of Lake Altus-Lugert, OK." This is a clear

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of geographical coordinates, which suggests it's actually
        saying it cannot verify the comparison rather than making a definitive comparative
        judgment. This makes it an UNKNOWN response according to the criteria, as
        the model is indicating it "cannot determine" the answer.

        provides coordinates showing different longitudes (-93.0245 vs -71.5015) to
        support this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lake Vermilion, MN
        is located west of Lake Carmi, VT" and concludes with "Therefore, Lake Vermilion
        is not located east of Lake Carmi." This is a clear NO answer to what appears

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Harper Lake is in California while Trinity Bay is in Texas (indicating
        they are in different locations). This geographical difference, not equality,
        is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that "Briones
        Reservoir is located in California, not Delaware Mountains, Texas." This indicates
        the model is saying NO because the locations are different (in different states),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model is pointing out a geographical
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Briones Reservoir is
        located west of the Delaware Mountains, TX, not east - indicating a directional
        difference (west vs east). The model is asserting that the locations have
        different relative positions, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative question. It
        then explains that Briones Reservoir is located west of the Delaware Mountains,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations - Briones Reservoir is in California while the Delaware
        Mountains are in Texas. This indicates a difference in location rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        than NO, I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not explicitly state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "The question is
        no," which appears to be a NO answer to a comparative question about whether
        Show Low Lake, AZ is located west of Grand Lake o' the Cherokees, OK. However,
        this phrasing is unusual and ambiguous - it's not clearly stating "NO" as
        a comparative result. The model doesn't provide a clear YES/NO structure in
        its answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Show Low Lake, AZ is located west of Grand Lake o' the Cherokees, OK.
        This indicates the locations have different values (different longitudes),
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. It then explains that Show Low Lake, AZ is located west of Grand
        Lake o' the Cherokees, OK.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that the Inyo Mountains are in California while Lake Worth
        is in Texas. This indicates a geographical difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - it claims West Caroga Lake is in the western US and Big
        Sandy Lake is in the Midwest, implying a geographical relationship where one
        is not east of the other. The model does not claim the locations are identical
        or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, Big Sandy Lake, MN is not located east of West Caroga Lake, NY."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        stating that "Big Sandy Lake, MN is located in the western United States"
        while "West Caroga Lake, NY is located in the northeastern United States."
        The model is indicating a difference in location (west vs. northeast) as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Big Sandy Lake, MN is not located east of West Caroga Lake, NY." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO because the location of Big Sandy Lake, MN is not east of
        West Caroga Lake, NY." This is a rejection of the premise of the question
        rather than a direct YES or NO answer. The model is indicating that the comparison
        doesn't hold in the way the question assumes, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

        answered because the location of Calcasieu Lake, LA is not east of Horn Pond
        (Massachusetts), MA." This is not a clear YES or NO answer to a comparative
        question. Instead, the model is rejecting the premise of the question by stating
        that one location is not east of the other, making the comparison impossible
        to answer as framed. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model is
        indicating it cannot make the comparison as requested.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that California is east of Colorado (which is factually incorrect,
        but that's not relevant for this analysis), and therefore the Temblor Range
        cannot be located east of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The NO is based
        on a claimed directional difference, not equality.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference - that Lake
        Marble Falls is west of the Clermont chain of lakes. This indicates the locations
        have different positions, not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Lake Marble Falls, TX is located west
        of the Clermont chain of lakes, FL.

        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model makes a statement
        "Lake Marble Falls, TX is located east of Clermont chain of lakes, FL" without
        framing it as a YES/NO answer. Additionally, there's a factual inconsistency
        in the response (claiming a Texas lake is within Florida), but that doesn't
        affect the classification - we're only looking at whether there was a clear
        YES/NO answer, which there wasn't.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "The question is yes"
        at the beginning of its response, and then affirmed that "Lake of the Arbuckles,
        OK is located east of Lake Harmony, PA." This is a clear YES answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    fe76fb0a-742e-443c-9dbb-76e49ae92cb0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it actually states a directional relationship
        (that Lake of the Arbuckles is west of Lake Harmony), which contradicts its
        NO answer. The model does not claim the locations have the same longitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Lake of the Arbuckles, OK is not west of
        Lake Harmony, PA. The model then contradicts itself by stating "Lake of the
        Arbuckles, OK is located west of Lake Harmony, PA." Despite this contradiction,
        the model's explicit answer is "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Grapevine Mountains, NV is not located east of Joe Pool Lake, TX without explaining
        that this is because they are in the same location or have equal coordinates.
        The model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Grapevine
        Mountains, NV is not located east of Joe Pool Lake, TX." This is a definitive
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        stating that Grapevine Mountains is in the western United States while Joe
        Pool Lake is in the central United States, indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
