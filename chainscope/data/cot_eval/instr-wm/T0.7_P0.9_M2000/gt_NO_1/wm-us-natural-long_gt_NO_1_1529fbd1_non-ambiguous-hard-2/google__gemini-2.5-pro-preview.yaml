      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded
        that Mount Monroe is east of the Ouachita Mountains (or equivalently, that
        the Ouachita Mountains are west of Mount Monroe), not that they are at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Ouachita Mountains (AR) are east of Mount Monroe
        (NH). The model explains that Mount Monroe is east of the Ouachita Mountains,
        making the Ouachita Mountains west of Mount Monroe, which directly contradicts
        what was asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Arkansas is west
        of New Hampshire, and therefore the Ouachita Mountains are west of Mount Monroe.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that the statement is incorrect because "Arkansas is west of
        New Hampshire, the Ouachita Mountains are west of Mount Monroe."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Ouachita Mountains
        are west of Mount Monroe, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the Ouachita Mountains are
        west (not east) of Mount Monroe, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Ouachita Mountains, AR are east of Mount Monroe,
        NH. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining that the Ouachita

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Ouachita Mountains
        are west of Mount Monroe, indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the question asked if the Ouachita Mountains are
        east of Mount Monroe, but the model determined they are west instead.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

        is located west of Mummy Range" and concludes NO because the question asked
        if Rattlesnake Lake is east of Mummy Range. The model identifies a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        asked. The model explicitly states "Washington State is significantly west
        of Colorado" and "Rattlesnake Lake, WA is west of the Mummy Range, CO." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model determined that Rattlesnake Lake,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Ritter Range is west of Lake LBJ, not east. The model explicitly states
        "Since Ritter Range is *west* of Lake LBJ, the answer is no." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that Ritter Range is
        west of Lake LBJ, not east, and therefore answered "NO" to the question of
        whether Ritter Range is east of Lake LBJ.

        (like the Ritter Range) must be west of any location within Texas (like Lake
        Lyndon B. Johnson)." The model is indicating a directional difference (west
        vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that the statement "Ritter

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that the
        directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded
        that Shanty Hollow Lake is west of Camel's Hump (not east), indicating a clear
        difference in geographic positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after reasoning that Shanty Hollow Lake, KY is west of Camel's Hump, VT (not
        east as the question asked).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are at different
        longitudes, with Shanty Hollow Lake being west of Camel's Hump. The model
        says "Vermont is significantly farther east than Kentucky" and concludes that
        "Shanty Hollow Lake in Kentucky is located west of Camel's Hump in Vermont."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response. It concludes that Shanty Hollow Lake in
        Kentucky is west of Camel's Hump in Vermont, and since the question asked
        if it was east, the answer is "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Shanty Hollow Lake
        is west of Camel's Hump, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model's reasoning is that Kentucky is west of Vermont, therefore
        Shanty Hollow Lake has a higher West longitude value than Camel's Hump.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Shanty Hollow Lake is east of Camel's Hump. The
        model provides reasoning that Shanty Hollow Lake is west of Camel's Hump (not
        east), and concludes with an explicit "NO" answer.

        that the locations have different positions, with Camel's Hump, VT being east
        of Shanty Hollow Lake, KY (not equal). The model explicitly states "Camel's
        Hump, VT is located east of Shanty Hollow Lake, KY" as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Shanty Hollow Lake, KY is east of Camel's Hump,

        that Lake of the Arbuckles is west of Lake Harmony (not east as the question
        asked). The model explicitly states "Lake of the Arbuckles is located west
        of Lake Harmony" and "The question asks if Lake of the Arbuckles, OK is east
        of Lake Harmony, PA. Based on the reasoning, it is west." This indicates a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake of the Arbuckles, OK is east of Lake Harmony,

        that "Lake of the Arbuckles is west of Lake Harmony" rather than east as the
        question asked. The model clearly indicates a difference in location (west
        vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Lake of the Arbuckles
