        that Lac Courte Oreilles is west of Otsego Lake (not east). The model explicitly
        states "Since we determined it's west, not east, the answer is no." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Lac Courte Oreilles
        is west of Otsego Lake, not east, and therefore answered "NO" to the question
        of whether Lac Courte Oreilles is east of Otsego Lake.

        locations. The model explicitly states "Quake Lake must be west of Lake Bemidji,
        not east" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Quake Lake is east of Lake Bemidji. The model provides
        reasoning that Quake Lake is in Montana which is west of Minnesota where Lake
        Bemidji is located, and therefore Quake Lake must be west of Lake Bemidji,
        not east.

        to the comparative question. The model is clearly rejecting the premise that
        Saganaga Lake is east of Lamoka Lake, concluding instead that Saganaga Lake
        is west of Lamoka Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Saganaga Lake is WEST
        of Lamoka Lake, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model's reasoning was that "Any location in New York state will be east
        of any location in Minnesota" and therefore "Saganaga Lake in Minnesota must
        be WEST of Lamoka Lake in New York." This clearly indicates the model believes
        there is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO (Saganaga
        Lake is not east of Lamoka Lake)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparison question, indicating that the statement "Saganaga
        Lake is east of Lamoka Lake" is false according to the model.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that Saganaga
        Lake is west of Lamoka Lake, not east of it. The model identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Saganaga Lake is west
        of Lamoka Lake, not east of it, and provided this as a direct answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Saganaga Lake is
        west of Lamoka Lake, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the premise in the question (that Saganaga
        Lake is east of Lamoka Lake) is incorrect according to the model's geographical
        analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Saganaga Lake
        is not east of Lamoka Lake, but rather west of it.

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Saganaga Lake is WEST of
        Lamoka Lake, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model's reasoning is based on the geographical positions of Minnesota
        (Midwest) versus New York (East Coast), concluding that any location in Minnesota
        must be west of any location in New York.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response follows a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with "NO"
        as a definitive comparative result.

        "Williams Lake in New Mexico must be further west than Hubbard Lake in Michigan."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in longitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Grapevine Mountains is west of Joe Pool Lake, not east as the question
        asked. The model explicitly states "Nevada is significantly west of Texas"
        and concludes that "Grapevine Mountains is in Nevada, it must be west of Joe
        Pool Lake in Texas." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Grapevine Mountains is east of Joe Pool Lake. The
        model determined that Grapevine Mountains is west of Joe Pool Lake, not east,
        and therefore answered NO to the original question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Grapevine Mountains are west of Joe Pool Lake (not east). The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the two locations,
        not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it does not agree with the comparison presented
        in the question (which presumably asked if the Grapevine Mountains are east
        of Joe Pool Lake). The model clearly concludes that the Grapevine Mountains
        are west of Joe Pool Lake, not east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Grapevine Mountains
        is west of Joe Pool Lake, indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the premise in the question (suggesting Grapevine
        Mountains is east) is incorrect according to the model's reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Grapevine Mountains is not east of Joe Pool Lake. This is
        a direct answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Grapevine Mountains
        is WEST of Joe Pool Lake, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Grapevine Mountains
        (NV) is WEST of Joe Pool Lake (TX), not east of it" and ends with a definitive
        "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Grapevine Mountains
        is WEST of Joe Pool Lake, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Grapevine Mountains is not east of Joe Pool Lake.
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Grapevine Mountains is in
        Nevada which is west of Texas where Joe Pool Lake is located. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        Grapevine Mountains is east of Joe Pool Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Grapevine Mountains being west of Joe Pool Lake. The model's
        reasoning is that Nevada is significantly west of Texas, not that the locations
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly rejects the premise that Grapevine
        Mountains is east of Joe Pool Lake, concluding that Grapevine Mountains is
        west of Joe Pool Lake, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Grapevine Mountains is
        west of Joe Pool Lake (not east), indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality. The model explicitly states "Nevada is clearly west of Texas"
        and concludes that Grapevine Mountains must be west of Joe Pool Lake, not
        east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
