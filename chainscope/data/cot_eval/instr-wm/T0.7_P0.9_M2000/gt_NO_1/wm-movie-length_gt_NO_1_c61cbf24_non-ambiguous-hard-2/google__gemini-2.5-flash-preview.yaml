      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Apache War Smoke has a runtime
        of 67 minutes while Chandralekha has a runtime of 145 minutes, and concludes
        that "67 is not longer than 145." The NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Final Answer is NO" and
        concludes with "NO" at the end of its response. The model clearly determined
        that Apache War Smoke (67 minutes) does not have a longer runtime than Chandralekha
        (145 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "186 minutes is significantly
        longer than 67 minutes" and concludes that "Apache War Smoke does not have
        a longer runtime." The NO answer is based on Chandralekha being longer, not
        on the runtimes being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Does Harold F. Kress's Apache War Smoke have a longer total
        runtime than Nambirajan's Chandralekha?". The answer is explicit and directly
        addresses the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "67 is less
        than 186" when comparing the runtimes of the two movies. The model clearly
        identified a difference between the values (67 minutes vs. 186 minutes) as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether "Apache War Smoke" has a longer runtime than "Chandralekha".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that Apache War Smoke (67 minutes) is significantly
        shorter than Chandralekha (either 191 or 180 minutes). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        "**Answer:** NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative
        comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Apache
        War Smoke (67 minutes) has a shorter runtime than Chandralekha (185+ minutes),
        not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states "67 minutes
        is clearly shorter" and "67 minutes is not longer than 185+ minutes." The
        model identified a clear difference between the two runtimes, with one being
        significantly shorter than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        In the last line of the response, it concludes "NO" after comparing the runtimes
        of the two movies (67 minutes vs 185+ minutes). The model explicitly states
        that Apache War Smoke's runtime is shorter than Chandralekha's, leading to
        a definitive NO answer to the question of whether Apache War Smoke has a longer
        runtime.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Chandralekha (145 minutes) is longer than Apache War Smoke (68 minutes).
        The model explicitly states "Since Chandralekha is longer, the answer is no."
        This indicates the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly determined that Apache War
        Smoke does not have a longer total runtime than Chandralekha, after comparing
        their runtimes (68 minutes vs. 145 minutes).

    cfb23eee-05e1-4021-a181-677651d872f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 67 minutes
        (Apache War Smoke) is not longer than 150 minutes (Chandralekha). The model
        is noting a difference in values (67 vs 150 minutes) and concluding that the
        first is shorter than the second, not equal to it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that "Apache War Smoke does not have a longer
        total runtime than Chandralekha" and provides "NO" as the final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly compares the two runtimes (67 minutes vs 186 minutes)
        and concludes that Apache War Smoke is NOT longer than Chandralekha because
        67 minutes is less than 186 minutes. The NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question
        of whether Apache War Smoke has a longer runtime than Chandralekha.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly compares the two different runtimes (67 minutes vs.
        188 minutes) and concludes that 67 minutes is not longer than 188 minutes.
        The values are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after determining that 67 minutes (Apache War Smoke) is not longer than 188
        minutes (Chandralekha).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Robot
        Rabbit's runtime (7 minutes) is less than Lullaby of Broadway's runtime (92
        minutes), not because the values are equal. The model clearly states "7 minutes
        is not longer than 92 minutes" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the runtimes of the two movies and determining that
        Robot Rabbit's runtime (7 minutes) is not longer than Lullaby of Broadway's
        runtime (92 minutes).

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Robot Rabbit" has a runtime
        of 7 minutes while "Lullaby of Broadway" has a runtime of 92 minutes, and
        concludes that "92 minutes is significantly longer than 7 minutes." The NO
        answer is given because "7 minutes is not longer than 92 minutes" - indicating
        a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It directly answers the comparative question
        with a definitive "NO" after comparing the runtimes of the two movies.

        model is clearly indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result to the question of whether Robot Rabbit
        has a longer runtime than Lullaby of Broadway. The model clearly indicates
        that Robot Rabbit has a shorter runtime.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes that 92 minutes is not longer than 146 minutes,
        clearly indicating the values are different (92 vs 146 minutes). The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after determining that 92 minutes (The Van's runtime) is not longer
        than 146 minutes (Chaahat's runtime).

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the runtimes are different (78
        minutes vs 143 minutes) and states that "143 minutes is longer than 78 minutes."
        The NO answer is given because "The Van" has a shorter runtime than "Chaahat,"
        not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "The Van" does
        not have a longer runtime than "Chaahat" after comparing their runtimes (78
        minutes vs 143 minutes).

        Instead, it explicitly states that "The Van's runtime (72 mins) is *not* longer
        than Chaahat's runtime (153 mins)" and compares two different values (72 minutes
        vs 153 minutes). The NO answer is based on the fact that one runtime is shorter
        than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and concludes with "NO" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        states "85 minutes is not longer than 160 minutes" as the reason for its NO
        answer, which indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Lake Tahoe's runtime is 81 minutes
        and Valiyavan's runtime is 125 minutes, and concludes that "81 is not longer
        than 125." The NO answer is based on one value being less than the other,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model clearly identifies a difference in values (10 vs 109 minutes) and
        states that one is not longer than the other, rather than stating they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly rejecting the comparison that Film, Film, Film has a longer runtime

        the values are equal. The model explicitly states "Is 10 minutes longer than
        76 minutes? No" and "The runtime of John Henry (10 mins) is not longer than
        the runtime of The Little Convict (76 mins)." This indicates a clear difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        of approximately 93 minutes while Insaaf Ki Devi has a runtime of approximately
        145 minutes. The model concludes that "93 is significantly shorter than 145"

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "The answer is:" but
        doesn't actually provide the final YES/NO answer after this phrase. However,
        in step 8, the model clearly states "the answer to the question... is NO"
        and in step 9 reaffirms "Therefore, the answer is NO." The model has clearly
        determined that Black Emanuelle 2 does NOT have a longer runtime than Insaaf

        answer is given because the first film has a shorter runtime than the second
        film, not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly compares the runtimes of the two films (93 minutes vs 140 minutes)

        Instead, it explicitly notes that Black Emanuelle 2 has a runtime of approximately
        88 minutes while Insaaf Ki Devi has a runtime of approximately 135 minutes.
        The model states "88 minutes is less than 135 minutes" as the reason for its

        Instead, it explicitly notes that Insaaf Ki Devi (150-160 minutes) is longer
        than Black Emanuelle 2 (90 minutes). The NO answer is given because the comparison
        shows the opposite of what was asked - Black Emanuelle 2 is shorter, not longer
        than Insaaf Ki Devi.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparative

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 90 minutes is shorter than 98
        minutes. The NO answer is given because one value is less than the other,
        not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 10 and as the final standalone word. It clearly compares the runtimes
        of the two movies and concludes that Cats and Bruises (90 minutes) does not
        have a longer runtime than Spiritual Kung Fu (98 minutes).

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "6-7 minutes is significantly
        shorter than 97-100 minutes." The model gives a NO answer because the first
        film's runtime is shorter than the second film's runtime, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        answer is based on this difference (one runtime being shorter than the other),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It compares the runtimes of the two movies (40 minutes vs 105 minutes) and

        of 105 minutes, and concluded that 40 minutes is less than 105 minutes. The
        NO answer was given because one value is less than the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies. The model determined that
        "Adventures in Wild California" has a runtime of 40 minutes, which is less
        than the 105 minutes runtime of "In My Country," and therefore concluded that
        the first movie does not have a longer runtime than the second.

        approximately 96 minutes) while the other runtime (Shahenshah directed by
        Virender Anand) is unknown. The model's NO answer is based on the inability
        to confirm the comparison due to missing information, not because the runtimes
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in the boxed conclusion at the end of its response. The model arrives at this
        answer because it cannot confirm that "The Last Blood" is longer than "Shahenshah"
        due to lack of information about the latter film's runtime.

        Instead, it explicitly notes that The Last Blood has a runtime of 95 minutes
        while Shahenshah has a runtime of 177 minutes, and concludes that "95 is less
        than 177." The NO answer is based on this inequality (one being less than
        the other), not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question 'Does Wong Jing's The Last Blood have a longer total runtime
        than Virender Anand's Shahenshah?' is NO." It also emphasizes this with "The
        final answer is $\boxed{NO}$." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        not state that the values are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted
        that 88 minutes is not longer than 154 minutes, implying they are different
        values. The NO is based on the comparison showing that the first movie is
        shorter than the second, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies and determining that Satan's

        of the Round Table (88 minutes) has a shorter runtime than Kadhal Sadugudu
        (150 minutes), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states
        "150 minutes is longer than 88 minutes" and "88 minutes is *not* longer than
        150 minutes," indicating a clear difference in values, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly compares the runtimes of the two films and concludes that "The
        Best Man (102 minutes) has a significantly longer runtime than Feline Frame-Up
        (7 minutes)" and then answers "Based on the comparison, the answer is no."

        of approximately 7 minutes while The Best Man has a runtime of approximately
        102 minutes. The model states "7 is not longer than 102" as the reason for
        its NO answer, which indicates a clear difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating that Chuck Jones's Feline Frame-Up

        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "The Man Inside" does not have a longer runtime than "Vidukathai"

        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies. It explicitly concludes that
        since 90 minutes is not longer than 144 minutes, the answer to whether "Elvis
        Has Left the Building" has a longer runtime than "Toman" is "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Elvis Has Left the Building"
        has a runtime of 90 minutes while "Toman" has a runtime of 144 minutes. The
        model concludes NO because the first movie has a SHORTER runtime (not equal),
        stating "90 minutes is not longer than 144 minutes." The values are clearly
        different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly concludes that "Elvis Has Left the Building" does not have a longer
        runtime than "Toman" after comparing their runtimes (90 minutes vs 144 minutes).
        The model directly answers the comparative question with a definitive "NO"
        at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that the runtime of "The Best of Kermit on Sesame
        Street" is ~54 minutes while "Paranthe Wali Gali" is ~108 minutes. The model
        states "54 minutes is *not* longer than 108 minutes. It is shorter." The NO
        answer is based on the first runtime being shorter than the second, not on
        them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$"
        at the end of its response. It clearly provides a comparative result, determining
        that "The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street" does NOT have a longer runtime
        than "Paranthe Wali Gali".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street runtime
        is approximately 60 minutes" while "Paranthe Wali Gali runtime is approximately
        125 minutes" and concludes that "60 minutes is not longer than 125 minutes."
        The model is clearly indicating a difference in values (60 vs 125 minutes)
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is therefore
        NO" and reiterates "NO" at the very end of its response. The model directly
        answers the comparative question with a definitive negative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 60 minutes is shorter than 95
        minutes. The model says "No, 60 minutes is *not* longer than 95 minutes" and
        "60 minutes vs. 95 minutes" indicating different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly concludes that "The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street" does not have
        a longer total runtime than "Paranthe Wali Gali" after comparing their runtimes
        (60 minutes vs. 95 minutes).

        Instead, it explicitly states that "The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street" has
        a runtime of ~50 minutes while "Paranthe Wali Gali" has a runtime of ~106
        minutes. The model concludes that "50 minutes is significantly shorter than
        106 minutes" as the reason for its NO answer. Since the model identifies a
        clear difference between the values (not equality), this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the runtime of "The Best
        of Kermit on Sesame Street" (~50-60 minutes) is shorter than the runtime of
        "Paranthe Wali Gali" (~100 minutes). The model clearly identifies a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street" has a shorter runtime
        than "Paranthe Wali Gali" and explicitly states "Therefore, the answer to
