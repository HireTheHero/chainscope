        In fact, it explicitly states that "67 minutes (*Apache War Smoke*) is significantly

        one runtime is shorter than the other, not because they are equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two films. The model determined that "Apache
        War Smoke" (67 minutes) is shorter than "Chandralekha" (188 minutes), and
