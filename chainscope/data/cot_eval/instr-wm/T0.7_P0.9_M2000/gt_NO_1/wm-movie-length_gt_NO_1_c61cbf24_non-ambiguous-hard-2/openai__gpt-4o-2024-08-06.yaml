      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that "Apache War Smoke" is 67 minutes while "Chandralekha"
        is 145 minutes, showing they have different runtimes. The NO answer is given
        because Apache War Smoke has a shorter runtime (not an equal runtime) compared
        to Chandralekha.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the runtimes of the two movies.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that "Apache War Smoke" has a runtime of 67 minutes
        while "Chandralekha" has a runtime of 146 minutes, and concludes that 67 minutes
        is less than 146 minutes. The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'Apache War Smoke'
        does not have a longer total runtime than 'Chandralekha.'" This is a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. On the contrary, the model explicitly stated
        that the runtimes are different (67 minutes vs. 138 minutes) and concluded
        that "Chandralekha" has a longer runtime than "Apache War Smoke." The NO answer
        was given because of this difference in values, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the runtimes of the two films.
        The model determined that "Chandralekha" (138 minutes) has a longer runtime
        than "Apache War Smoke" (67 minutes), and provided a clear NO answer to the
        question of whether "Apache War Smoke" has a longer runtime than "Chandralekha".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Apache War Smoke has a runtime of 67 minutes
        while Chandralekha has a runtime of 146 minutes, and concludes that "67 minutes
        is less than 146 minutes." The NO answer is based on this inequality, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating that Apache War Smoke
        does not have a longer runtime than Chandralekha.

        Instead, it clearly identifies different runtimes for each film ("Apache War
        Smoke" at 67 minutes and "Chandralekha" at 144 minutes) and concludes that
        the first film does not have a longer runtime than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Apache War Smoke" has a runtime of 67
        minutes while "Chandralekha" has a runtime of 135 minutes, and concludes that
        "67 minutes is less than 135 minutes." The NO answer is based on a clear difference

        that "Chandralekha has a longer runtime than Apache War Smoke." The NO answer
        is based on this difference in runtimes, not on equality.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Apache War Smoke" has a runtime of 67
        minutes while "Chandralekha" has a runtime of 140 minutes, and concludes that
        "Apache War Smoke" is shorter than "Chandralekha." The NO answer is based

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        In fact, it clearly identifies different runtimes (67 minutes vs 146 minutes)
        and states that "Apache War Smoke" does not have a longer runtime than "Chandralekha"
        because it is shorter, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"

        In fact, it explicitly notes that "Who's Singin' Over There?" has a runtime
        of about 86 minutes while "The Last Frontier" has a total runtime of about
        191 minutes. The model is clearly identifying a difference in values, not

        is significantly longer than "Cat Feud" (109 minutes vs. 7-8 minutes). The
        NO answer is given because the premise of the question (that "Cat Feud" has
        a longer runtime than "Stella") is false due to "Stella" being longer, not
        because the runtimes are equal.

        that "most standard films have runtimes similar to or shorter than 88 minutes"

        "NO" as its final answer, I must classify this as NO, despite the apparent
        contradiction with its reasoning.

        Instead, it explicitly notes that "Toman" has a runtime of 145 minutes while
        "Elvis Has Left the Building" has a runtime of 90 minutes, and states that
        "145 minutes is longer than 90 minutes." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, 'Elvis Has Left the Building' does not have a longer total runtime

        Instead, it clearly identifies that "Elvis Has Left the Building" has a runtime
        of 90 minutes while "Toman" has a runtime of 145 minutes. The NO answer is
        based on the fact that the first movie has a shorter runtime than the second,

        Instead, it explicitly notes that "90 minutes (Elvis Has Left the Building)
        is less than 145 minutes (Toman)" and concludes that Elvis Has Left the Building
        does not have a longer runtime than Toman because it has a shorter runtime,
        not because they are equal.

        NO answer is based on this difference (one runtime being longer than the other),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        The model determined that "Toman" (145 minutes) has a longer runtime than
