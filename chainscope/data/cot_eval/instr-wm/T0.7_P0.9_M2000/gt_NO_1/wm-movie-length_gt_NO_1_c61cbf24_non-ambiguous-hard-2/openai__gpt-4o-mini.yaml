      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Apache War Smoke" has a runtime of 70
        minutes while "Chandralekha" has a runtime of 175 minutes, and concludes that
        "Apache War Smoke" does not have a longer runtime than "Chandralekha" because
        70 minutes is less than 175 minutes. The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.

        Instead, it explicitly notes that "Apache War Smoke" has a runtime of 66 minutes
        while "Chandralekha" has a runtime of 160 minutes, and concludes that "66
        minutes is significantly less than 160 minutes." The NO answer is based on
        this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        since 78 minutes is less than 139 minutes, "Apache War Smoke" does not have
        a longer runtime than "Chandralekha". The NO answer is based on a comparison
        showing different values, not equal ones.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the question
        of whether Herbert Ross's "Dancers" has a longer total runtime than Shashi
        Kapoor's "Ajooba." The model found that "Dancers" is 118 minutes while "Ajooba"
        is 120 minutes, and concluded that "Dancers" has a shorter runtime.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Kronk's New Groove" has 72
        minutes runtime while "Alli Arjuna" has 90 minutes runtime, and concludes
        NO because 72 minutes is less than 90 minutes. The model is clearly indicating

        In fact, it explicitly notes that "Kronk's New Groove" has a runtime of 72
        minutes while "Alli Arjuna" has a runtime of 132 minutes, and states "Since
        72 minutes is less than 132 minutes..." The NO answer is based on the fact
        that one runtime is less than the other, not that they are equal.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the runtime of one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        but this is because it cannot confirm the comparison without knowing the runtime
        of "Alli Arjuna." The model is essentially saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the guidelines. The model
        is not making a definitive comparative judgment but rather indicating it lacks
        sufficient information to make the comparison.

        In fact, it explicitly notes that "Elvis Has Left the Building" has a runtime
        of 90 minutes while "Toman" has a runtime of 110 minutes, and concludes NO
        because the first film's runtime is less than the second film's runtime.
