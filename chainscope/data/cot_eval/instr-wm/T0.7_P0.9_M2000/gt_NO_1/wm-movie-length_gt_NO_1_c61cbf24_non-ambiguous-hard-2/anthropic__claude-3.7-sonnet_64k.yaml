      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values, not on equality. It states that "Apache War Smoke" has a runtime
        of 67 minutes while "Chandralekha" has a runtime of 193 minutes, and concludes
        that "67 minutes is less than 193 minutes." The model is indicating a significant
        difference between the runtimes, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model directly answers the comparative question with "Harold F. Kress's
        'Apache War Smoke' does not have a longer total runtime than 'Chandralekha.'"
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Apache War Smoke (67 minutes) is "considerably
        shorter than" Chandralekha (193-207 minutes). The model gives a clear difference
        in values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
        "Does Harold F. Kress's Apache War Smoke have a longer total runtime than
        Nambirajan's Chandralekha?" with "NO" after comparing the runtimes.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model compares the runtimes of "Apache War Smoke" (67 minutes) and "Chandralekha"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Refused Are Fucking Dead" has a runtime
        of 61 minutes while "Morgan - A Suitable Case for Treatment" has a runtime
        of 97 minutes. The model concludes that "Since 61 minutes is less than 97
        minutes, 'Refused Are Fucking Dead' has a shorter runtime than 'Morgan - A
        Suitable Case for Treatment.'" The model is clearly indicating a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question with a definitive "NO" after comparing the runtimes of the two films.

        a runtime of about 45 minutes while "Morgan - A Suitable Case for Treatment"
        has a runtime of about 97 minutes. The model clearly indicates a difference
        in values (45 minutes vs 97 minutes) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that "Refused Are Fucking Dead" does not have a longer

        it found that "Morgan - A Suitable Case for Treatment" has a longer runtime
        (97 minutes) than "Refused Are Fucking Dead" (45-60 minutes). The model explicitly
        states there is a difference of "approximately 37-52 minutes" between the

        states that "Refused Are Fucking Dead" has a runtime of 75 minutes while "Morgan
        - A Suitable Case for Treatment" has a runtime of 97 minutes, and concludes
        that "Since 75 minutes is less than 97 minutes, Kristofer Steen's film does
        not have a longer runtime than Karel Reisz's film." The values are clearly
        different, not equal.

        response after comparing the runtimes of the two movies. The model concludes
        that "Refused Are Fucking Dead" does not have a longer runtime than "Morgan

        In fact, it explicitly states that "The Little Convict" is significantly longer

        runtimes for each film (10-11 minutes vs. 80-85 minutes) and bases its NO

        In fact, it explicitly states that one runtime is significantly less than

        first film's runtime is shorter than the second film's runtime, not because

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that "Cat Feud" has a runtime of approximately
        7 minutes while "Stella" has a runtime of approximately 109 minutes. The model
        states that "7 minutes is significantly less than 109 minutes," which is the
        reason for the NO answer. The model is clearly indicating a difference in
        values, not equality.

        The model concludes that "Chuck Jones's 'Cat Feud' does NOT have a longer

        "Cat Feud" being approximately 6-8 minutes and "Stella" being approximately
        109 minutes. The model's NO answer is based on this difference, specifically
        that Stella's runtime is significantly longer than Cat Feud's runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Chuck Jones's Cat Feud does NOT have a longer total

        Instead, it explicitly notes that "Cat Feud" has a runtime of approximately

        answer is based on "Cat Feud" having a shorter runtime than "Stella," not

        while "Kadhal Sadugudu" has 137 minutes, and since 89 is less than 137, the
        first movie does not have a longer runtime than the second.

        a runtime of 53 minutes while "Shiva" has a runtime of 137 minutes (or 120
        minutes for the 2006 version), and concludes that "53 minutes is less than

        while "Rustlers' Rhapsody" has a runtime of 88 minutes, and concludes that
        "Supertwink" is "significantly less than" the other film. The NO answer is

        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two films. The model concludes that "Since
        86 minutes is less than 142 minutes, Dr. Plonk does not have a longer total
        runtime than Mera Rakshak."

        that there doesn't appear to be a film called "Yolki" directed by Ignas Jonynas,
        so it cannot have a runtime that exceeds "Sherman's March". The model also
        mentions that if referring to the Russian "Yolki" film (not by Jonynas), its
        runtime is approximately 89 minutes, which is significantly shorter than "Sherman's

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Kermit compilation is "almost
        certainly has a shorter runtime" and would be "significantly shorter" than
        the Indian feature film. The model gives a clear directional comparison, indicating
        one runtime is shorter than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model directly answers the comparative question with
        a definitive "NO" statement, indicating that "The Best of Kermit on Sesame
        Street" does not have a longer total runtime than "Paranthe Wali Gali".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        runtime is shorter than the other, not because they are equal. It specifically
        states that "The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street" has a runtime of ~30 minutes
        while "Paranthe Wali Gali" has a runtime of ~110 minutes, and concludes that
        "Since 30 minutes is less than 110 minutes, 'The Best of Kermit on Sesame
        Street' does NOT have a longer total runtime than 'Paranthe Wali Gali.'"
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes with "# Answer: NO" after determining that "The Best of
        Kermit on Sesame Street" does NOT have a longer total runtime than "Paranthe
        Wali Gali."'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    faf06799-23cb-4050-86f7-97e8d53dbf86:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions: "If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated in the
        conclusion section as "YES - Sachin Gupta's 'Paranthe Wali Gali' has a longer
        total runtime than Emily Squires's 'The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street.'"
        The model explicitly states YES as its comparative answer.
