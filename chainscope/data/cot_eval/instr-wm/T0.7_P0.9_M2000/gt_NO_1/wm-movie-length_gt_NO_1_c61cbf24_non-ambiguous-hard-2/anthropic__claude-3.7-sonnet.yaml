      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that the runtimes are different
        (67 minutes vs 193 minutes) and concludes that "67 minutes is less than 193
        minutes." The NO answer is based on this inequality, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies and determining that "Apache
        War Smoke" (67 minutes) is less than "Chandralekha" (193 minutes).

        The NO answer is based on one runtime being shorter than the other, not on
        the runtimes being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Harold F. Kress's
        'Apache War Smoke' does not have a longer total runtime than 'Chandralekha.'"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that the runtimes are different (83 minutes vs
        140 minutes) and states "83 minutes < 140 minutes" as the reason for its NO
        answer. The model is saying NO because one runtime is shorter than the other,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Boris Durov's "Pirates of the 20th Century" does not have
        a longer total runtime than Sabapathy's "V.I.P". This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer to this question" due to uncertainty about the second film.
        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison because information about

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a
        NO answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of information about the runtime of the second
        film. The model acknowledges it has information about "Pirates of the 20th
        Century" (83 minutes) but cannot make the comparison because it lacks reliable
        information about "V.I.P" directed by Sabapathy.

        that Lake Tahoe has a shorter runtime (81 minutes) than Valiyavan (157 minutes).
        The model explicitly states the values are different (81 vs 157 minutes) and
        this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Lake Tahoe has a shorter
        runtime (81 minutes) than Valiyavan (157 minutes), and therefore answered
        "NO" to what appears to be a question about whether Lake Tahoe has a longer
        runtime than Valiyavan.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what I classified as UNKNOWN because it couldn't verify the
        premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's explanation indicates it cannot make the comparison because
        it cannot verify that Peter Lord directed a film called "War Story" and doesn't
        have runtime information for either film. This is a case where the model is
        rejecting the premise of the question (that Peter Lord directed "War Story")
        and stating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model says "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means "I cannot confirm" due to lacking information. This is effectively
        saying "I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category. The model
        is not making a comparative determination but stating it lacks the necessary
        data.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"
        because it cannot confirm the existence of one of the films. This is a case
        where the model rejects the premise of the question (suggesting one film may
        be fictional) and explicitly states it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" due to lack of information about the films
        and their runtimes. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison because
        it doesn't have the runtime data for either film and is uncertain if one of
        the films exists.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, but
        then immediately clarifies that this is not a comparative result but rather
        indicates inability to verify the comparison. The model states "I cannot verify
        that it is longer" and "I cannot determine which film has a longer runtime."
        This makes it clear the model is saying it cannot make the determination,
        not that one film is actually shorter than the other.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer" because it lacks information about the runtime of "Mr. Sampati."

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question with the information available to me" because
        it lacks information about one of the films. This indicates the model cannot

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the criteria, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather,
        it indicated it couldn't make the comparison due to lack of information about
        one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Seijun Suzuki's 'Kanto Wanderer' has a longer runtime than S. S. Vasan's
        'Mr. Sampati'..." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify"
        or "NO, I cannot determine" because it lacks information about one of the
        films. According to the criteria, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, since the model is not making a comparative determination but rather
        stating its inability to make the comparison due to lack of information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that "The Best of
        Kermit on Sesame Street" has a runtime of 30 minutes while "Paranthe Wali
        Gali" has a runtime of 120 minutes, and concludes NO because 30 minutes is
        less than 120 minutes. The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies. The model determined that
        "The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street" does not have a longer total runtime
        than "Paranthe Wali Gali" because 30 minutes is less than 120 minutes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that the runtimes are different (30 minutes
        vs. 120 minutes) and that one is shorter than the other. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "30 minutes is less than 120 minutes" as
        the reason for its NO answer, indicating a clear difference between the values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that "The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street" has
        a runtime of 60 minutes while "Paranthe Wali Gali" has a runtime of 120 minutes,
        and concludes that 60 minutes is less than 120 minutes. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that "The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street" does not have
        a longer runtime than "Paranthe Wali Gali." This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.
