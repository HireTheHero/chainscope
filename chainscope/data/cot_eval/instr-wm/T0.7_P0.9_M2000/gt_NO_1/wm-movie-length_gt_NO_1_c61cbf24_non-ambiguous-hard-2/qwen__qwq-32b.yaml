      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Chandralekha has a significantly longer
        runtime (approximately 180 minutes) compared to Apache War Smoke (approximately
        75-85 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference in runtime, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Apache War Smoke does not have a longer total runtime
        than Chandralekha. This is a clear comparative judgment with a definitive
        NO answer.

        of approximately 7.5 minutes while War Requiem has a runtime of approximately
        85 minutes. The model concludes "NO" because the first film's runtime is "significantly
        shorter than" the second film's runtime, not because they are equal.

        while Jaani Dushman has a runtime of 162 minutes, and it concludes "95 minutes
        (The Norseman) < 162 minutes (Jaani Dushman)." The NO answer is based on this
        inequality, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that The Norseman has a runtime of
        approximately 84-85 minutes while Jaani Dushman has a runtime of 163 minutes.
        The model's NO answer is based on the fact that 85 minutes is less than 163
        minutes, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. This is stated both in the one-word

        does not have a longer total runtime than Jaani Dushman."

        values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. The Norseman does

        Instead, it explicitly compares the two runtimes (98 minutes vs 146 minutes)

        model states "Since 146 minutes is longer than 98 minutes, The Norseman does
        not have a longer runtime." This indicates a clear difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Charles B. Pierce's The Norseman does not have a longer total

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison where
        it found the values to be different, not equal. It specifically states that
        "Distance" is longer (129 minutes) than "Hawaiian Aye Aye" (93 minutes). The
        model concludes "NO" because one runtime is clearly longer than the other,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Hawaiian Aye Aye" has a longer runtime than "Distance." The model
        provides a clear comparative conclusion based on the runtimes it identifies
        (93 minutes vs 129 minutes).

        or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Distance" is significantly longer
        (approximately 130 minutes) than "Hawaiian Aye Aye" (approximately 90 minutes).
        The model explicitly states "the latter is significantly longer" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Hawaiian Aye Aye" has a longer runtime than "Distance."
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        Instead, it explicitly compares the runtimes as 87 minutes for Hawaiian Aye
        Aye versus 117 minutes for Distance, concluding that Distance is longer. The
        NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        of 120+ minutes. The model concludes NO because the first film is shorter
        than the second film, not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its final conclusion. It provides a clear comparative judgment that David

        Instead, it explicitly compares the runtimes and states that Z Storm (99 minutes)
        is shorter than Gie (165 minutes). The model says "NO" because one is longer
        than the other, not because they are the same.

        Instead, it explicitly gives different runtimes for the two movies (114 minutes
        for Honkytonk Man vs. 90 minutes for Chaser on the Rocks) and concludes that
        Honkytonk Man is longer. The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that "Chaser on the Rocks" does not have a longer

        states "Sherman's March is longer" and notes that Yolki "falls short of Sherman's

        a comparison showing one runtime is longer than the other, not that they are

        runtime is shorter than Sherman's March, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model compares the runtime of Ignas Jonynas's Yolki
        (346 minutes) with Sherman's March (490 minutes) and concludes that Yolki

        Instead, it clearly indicates that "Paranthe Wali Gali" has a much longer

        states that the TV series has "exponentially longer" runtime than the Kermit

        ~60-90 minutes for the Kermit compilation.

        Instead, it explicitly states that the values are different, with Paranthe

        Kermit on Sesame Street (estimated at 60-90 minutes, or at maximum around
        120 minutes). The model's NO answer is based on this difference in runtime.

        In fact, it explicitly states that the Bollywood film is "significantly longer"

        Wali Gali" is longer, not because the runtimes are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
