      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Apache
        War Smoke (67 minutes) is significantly shorter than Chandralekha (186 minutes),
        not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states "No, it is significantly
        shorter" when comparing the runtimes, indicating a clear difference between
        the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Does Apache War Smoke have a longer runtime than Chandralekha?"
        The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing the runtimes (67
        minutes vs 186 minutes) and determining that Apache War Smoke is "significantly
        shorter."
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Instead, it explicitly notes that "67 minutes is significantly shorter than
        186 minutes" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is comparing different
        values (67 vs 186 minutes) and concluding that Apache War Smoke does not have
        a longer runtime than Chandralekha because it is shorter.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that World of Tomorrow has a runtime
        of 74 minutes while Ostitto has a runtime of 140 minutes, and concludes that
        74 minutes is not longer than 140 minutes. The model is comparing different
        values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether World of Tomorrow's total runtime is longer than
        Ostitto's runtime. The answer is explicitly stated in bold at the end of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies that one runtime (74 minutes) is
        less than the other (141 minutes), and this inequality is the reason for the
        NO answer. The model is saying NO because the first work is shorter than the
        second, not because they have equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two works. The model concludes that "World
        of Tomorrow" (74 minutes) is not longer than "Ostitto" (141 minutes).

        being longer than 85 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off before
        providing a final answer. The model begins analyzing the question but doesn't
        reach a conclusion or provide a clear YES/NO answer. It only gets as far as
        identifying the first movie and starting to identify the second movie before
        cutting off.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it states that one film appears to be non-existent (with
        a runtime of 0 minutes or undefined), while the other has a runtime of approximately
        155 minutes. The model concludes that "A runtime of 0 minutes (or an undefined
        runtime for a non-existent film) is not longer than ~155 minutes." This indicates
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. This is a clear negative comparative result to the question
        of whether the first film's runtime is longer than the second film's runtime.

        while Sherman's March is approximately 157 minutes, and concludes that 90
        minutes is not longer than 157 minutes. The NO answer is based on one runtime
        being shorter than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies and determining that 90 minutes

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly states that 90 minutes is shorter than 145 minutes, which
        is the reason for the NO answer. The model identifies a difference in values,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Elvis Has Left the Building"
        has a runtime of 90 minutes while "Toman" has a runtime of 145 minutes, and
        concludes that 90 minutes is shorter than 145 minutes. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. It directly answers the comparative question with
        a definitive negative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies that one runtime is 30 minutes and
        the other is 109 minutes, and determines that the first is not longer than
        the second because it is shorter. The model is comparing different values,
        not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two films. The model concludes that 30

        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies. The model concludes that "The
        Best of Kermit on Sesame Street" is not longer than "Paranthe Wali Gali" because

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that 30 minutes is shorter than 95
        minutes, which is the reason for the NO answer. The model identifies a clear
        difference between the two runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two movies. The model concludes that "30
