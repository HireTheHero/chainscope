      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, the answer is YES"
        at the beginning of its response, making it clear that its final answer is
        YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes, Apache War Smoke
        has a longer total runtime than Chandralekha." This is a clear affirmative
        answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    241ead23-4654-4a3a-b6d1-c882bf104736:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer because it couldn't determine the values at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot
        determine the runtimes of either movie, which means it cannot make the comparison.
        This is a case where the model says "NO" but actually means it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question doesn't apply. The model didn't give a NO answer at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Harold F. Kress's Apache War
        Smoke does have a longer total runtime than Nambirajan's Chandralekha" but
        this directly contradicts the runtime data it provided (151 minutes vs 170
        minutes). The model never explicitly states YES or NO in its answer. While
        it makes a comparative claim, it doesn't frame it as a direct YES/NO answer
        to the original question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response after comparing the runtimes of the two films (150 minutes
        vs 120 minutes) and concluding that Nambirajan''s Chandralekha has a longer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer to the question" because it lacks information about the runtimes
        of both movies. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a clear YES or NO answer. The model indicates
        it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison between the runtimes
        of the two films.

      result: UNKNOWN
    cc2022d2-daa3-4050-bb7e-9d5e9b46230e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Apache War Smoke
        has a shorter total runtime than Chandralekha," indicating a difference between
        the two values. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO."
        followed by an explanation that "Apache War Smoke has a shorter total runtime
        than Chandralekha."'

        In fact, it explicitly states that Apache War Smoke has a shorter runtime
        than Chandralekha, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and then clarifies that "Apache War Smoke has a shorter runtime than
        Chandralekha." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather, it stated it couldn't
        determine the comparison due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response. However, the explanation indicates that the
        model cannot determine the comparison because it lacks information about the
        runtime of "Apache War Smoke." This means the model is actually saying it
        cannot make the determination, which qualifies as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.

      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. However, this NO is given because the model
        cannot determine the runtime of one of the movies (Food), not because it has
        determined that one runtime is not longer than the other. This is a case where
        the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it calculates different runtimes (150 minutes for "The Dot and the
        Line" and 120 minutes for "The Earrings of Madame de...") and uses this difference
        as the basis for its NO answer. The model is saying NO because "The Dot and
        the Line" is longer (150 minutes), not shorter than "The Earrings of Madame
        de..." (120 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" when
        comparing whether "The Dot and the Line" has a shorter total runtime than
        "The Earrings of Madame de...". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model immediately explains that it cannot determine the comparison
        because it lacks information about one of the movies' runtimes. This indicates
        the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative

        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what appears to be a NO answer but actually indicated it couldn't
        determine the information needed for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: No" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
        However, the model also states that it cannot determine the runtimes of either
        film from the provided context, which means it cannot actually make the comparison.
        This makes the final answer UNKNOWN rather than NO, as the model is essentially
        saying it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (runtimes)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Chow Hound does not have a longer
        runtime than Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, but doesn't explain whether this is
        because they're equal or because Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid has a longer runtime.
        Since equality is not explicitly mentioned as the reason for the NO answer,
        I cannot classify this as being due to equal values.

        runtime. The NO answer is based on a difference in values (100 vs 101 minutes),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and then explains that "Chuck Jones's Chow Hound has a shorter total
        runtime than Carl Reiner's Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid." This is a clear NO

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather,
        it indicated it couldn't make the comparison due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also states that it cannot answer the question because
        it doesn't have information about the runtime of "Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai."

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a comparison of runtimes (130 minutes
        vs 90 minutes) and concludes that "Last Plane Out does have a longer total
        runtime than Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai." While the model doesn't explicitly state
        "YES" as a single word answer, it clearly affirms the comparative statement
        in the question with a positive conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        couldn't determine the runtimes at all.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.
        However, in the explanation leading up to this answer, the model states that
        it cannot determine the answer because it lacks information about the runtimes
        of both movies. This indicates the model is actually expressing uncertainty
        rather than making a negative comparative judgment.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Hooked Bear does have
        a longer total runtime than Lost in the Stars" after comparing the runtimes
        (1 hour 30 minutes vs 1 hour 40 minutes). This is a clear comparative statement,
        but it's actually incorrect based on the times provided. The model did not
        explicitly state YES or NO, but made a definitive comparative claim without
        using those exact words.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Hooked Bear does have a longer
        total runtime than Lost in the Stars" which is a clear affirmative statement,
        but it doesn't explicitly state "YES" as required by the criteria. According
        to the instructions, we should classify this as UNKNOWN since there is no
        clear YES/NO answer explicitly stated.

        are equal or the same. In fact, the model states it doesn't know the runtime
        of "Guided Mouse-ille" at all, so it's not making an equality comparison.
        The model simply concludes "NO" without establishing equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        about the runtime of "Guided Mouse-ille" while noting that "Lady Caroline
        Lamb" has a runtime of 90 minutes. The NO answer is based on insufficient
        information about one of the values rather than equality between the values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot determine the runtime
        of "Guided Mouse-ille" and therefore concludes that it does not have a longer
        runtime than "Lady Caroline Lamb" (which has a known runtime of 1 hour and
        42 minutes). The NO is based on lack of information about one value, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Abe Levitow's "Guided Mouse-ille"

        have a longer runtime than Lucas Reiner's film, without specifying whether
        the runtimes are equal or if Lucas Reiner's film is actually longer. The model
        does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        NO), the instructions state that I should put False for this question. The
        model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather it
        indicated it couldn't determine the answer due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, but
        then immediately explains that it cannot answer the question because the context
        does not specify the runtime of either movie. This indicates the model is
        saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category per
        the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it notes "Unknown" for both runtimes in its
        step-by-step reasoning, but does not explicitly state that they are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. Without an explicit statement that the runtimes
        are equal/identical/the same as the reason for the NO answer, this cannot
        be classified as True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifications or indications that it cannot determine the answer.
        While the model notes "Unknown" for both runtimes in its steps, it still provides
        a definitive "NO" as its comparative conclusion.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot ascertain the runtime
        of either film because this information is not provided in the context. The
        NO answer appears to be given because the model cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "John Henry does have
        a longer total runtime than The Little Convict." This is a positive comparative
        statement, but it doesn't explicitly state "YES" as required by the criteria.
        The model clearly indicates John Henry is longer (123 minutes vs 90 minutes)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer is classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; it gave
        what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer because it lacks information about the runtime of "Playdate with
        Destiny" and states that "Insaaf Main Karoongaa" has an unknown runtime. This
        means the model is actually indicating it cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information, which qualifies as UNKNOWN despite the explicit
        "NO" statement.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot determine the comparison
        because Z Storm's runtime is not mentioned or specified. This is a case where

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "we cannot determine whether 'The Last
        Blood' has a longer total runtime than 'Shahenshah'" because it lacks information
        about the runtimes of both movies. This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.

        are equal. Instead, it states that "Galileo has an unknown runtime" and concludes
        that "it cannot be longer than 143 minutes." The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer, but rather making a determination based on
        incomplete information about one of the values.

        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it believes Jacques Doillon's Family Life
        has a longer total runtime than Mahesh Amber Kothare's Dhum Dhadaka. The model
        reinforces this by stating "we can infer from the context that Family Life
        is a longer movie than Dhum Dhadaka."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually indicating it couldn't make
        the comparison due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison because it
        lacks information about the runtimes of both movies. This is a case where
        the model says "NO" but actually means it cannot determine the answer due
        to insufficient information.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make a comparison that resulted in a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it outlined steps for how to approach the question
        but then stated "we cannot provide a specific runtime for either movie" without
        giving a final comparative judgment. The model essentially refused to complete
        the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer. Instead, it gives a comparative statement "Dr. Plonk has a longer
        total runtime than Mera Rakshak" without explicitly stating YES or NO. The
        model also doesn't provide actual runtime information for either film, just
        placeholders like "(Give the runtime here)" and "(Provide the answer here)".

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what I classified as UNKNOWN because it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response. However, the model is actually indicating
        it cannot determine the answer because it lacks information about the runtime
        of "Come Dance with Me!" This is a case where the model says "NO" but means
        it cannot verify or determine the answer due to missing information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. In fact, the model states that Elvis Has Left the Building is 157
        minutes while Toman is 156 minutes. The model's reasoning appears to be that
        Elvis Has Left the Building is actually longer (not shorter) than Toman, which
        is why it answers NO to the question of whether Elvis Has Left the Building
        has a shorter runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Elvis Has Left the Building does not have a shorter runtime
        than Toman. The model provides a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it mentions that "the question is about the
        runtime of two movies, not the runtime of The Sesame Street gang's episode,"
        suggesting a rejection of the premise rather than equality of values. However,
        since the final answer was clearly "NO" and not a rejection of the premise
        (which would be UNKNOWN), I must evaluate whether equality was the reason
        for the NO, which it was not.
