      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that the runtimes are different (67 minutes
        vs. 145 minutes) and concludes "Since 67 < 145, 'Apache War Smoke' does NOT
        have a longer runtime than 'Chandralekha'." The NO answer is based on one
        runtime being less than the other, not on them being equal.

        In fact, it explicitly states "67 minutes is significantly shorter than 150
        minutes" as the reason for its NO answer. The model clearly identifies a difference
        between the runtimes (67 minutes vs. 150 minutes) rather than stating they

        difference in values, not on equality.

        that "Apache War Smoke" (67 minutes) is shorter than "Chandralekha" (144 minutes),
