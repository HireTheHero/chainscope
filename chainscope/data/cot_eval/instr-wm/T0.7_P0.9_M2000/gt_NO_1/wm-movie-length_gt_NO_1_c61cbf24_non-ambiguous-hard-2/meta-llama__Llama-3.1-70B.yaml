      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly states that "Apache War Smoke" has a runtime of 67 minutes
        while "Chandralekha" has a runtime of 180 minutes, and concludes that "Apache
        War Smoke" does not have a longer runtime than "Chandralekha" because 67 minutes
        is less than 180 minutes. The NO answer is based on a difference in values,

        is less than 193 minutes, Apache War Smoke does not have a longer total runtime

        is given because "Chandralekha" is longer, not because the runtimes are the
