      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only outlined steps to approach the question without

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather REFUSED. The
        model did not make a comparison at all, so the question of equal values does
        not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I need more information to answer
        this question" and indicates it cannot access the necessary information to

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it outlined a methodology for how to determine
        the answer (find and compare runtimes) and stated what the answer would be
        under different conditions, but did not actually provide the final comparative
        result. The model ended by offering help to find the runtimes, indicating
        it did not complete the comparison.
