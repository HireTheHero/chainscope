      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        information about one of the movies.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO." at the
        end of its response, which appears to be its final answer. However, in the
        preceding step, it states "I cannot answer this question from the provided
        context" because it lacks information about one of the movies. This indicates
        the model is saying NO because it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information, not as a comparative result.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided information about the runtimes
        of both movies (Apache War Smoke at 107 minutes and Chandralekha at 104 minutes)
        and concluded that "The total runtime of Apache War Smoke is longer than the
        total runtime of Chandralekha." However, it did not explicitly state a YES
        or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply stated a comparative
        fact without providing the required YES/NO format answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it mentions it cannot determine the runtime
        of one of the movies (Chandralekha), which means it cannot establish equality
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model does not explicitly state that
        the runtimes are equal or identical as the reason for its NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." While the
        model mentions it cannot find information about one of the movies, it still
        provides a definitive "NO" as its answer.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly mentions that it cannot determine
        the runtime of one of the movies (Chandralekha). The NO answer is not based
        on equality of values but rather on inability to complete the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, it does" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a clear affirmative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the runtimes of the two movies) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly
        states that it does not have information about the runtime of Anjaam, which
        means it couldn't have based its NO answer on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifications like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        this appears to be inconsistent with its reasoning, as it stated it couldn't
        answer the question due to missing information about Anjaam's runtime. Despite
        this inconsistency, I must classify based on what was explicitly stated as
        the final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" twice in its response.
        First as "**YES.**" and then as "The answer is YES." This is a clear affirmative
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        information about one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this appears to be a case where the model is saying "NO" because
        it cannot determine the answer due to missing information about Anjaam's runtime.
        The model states "I cannot answer this question from the provided context."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        in the explanation, the model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" because it lacks information about Anjaam's runtime.
        This indicates the model is saying NO while acknowledging it lacks information
        to make the comparison, which makes this an UNKNOWN response rather than a
        definitive NO comparative result.

        this appears to be a case where the model is saying "NO" because it cannot
        make the comparison due to missing information about Anjaam's runtime. Since
        the model states it "cannot answer this question from the provided context,"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifications like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        in the explanation, the model states it cannot answer the question because
        it lacks information about the runtime of one of the movies. This contradiction

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifications like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        in step 2, the model acknowledges it doesn't have information about the runtime
        of Simha, which suggests it cannot actually make the comparison. This creates
        a contradiction between the reasoning and the answer. Since the model gave
        a clear "NO" without explicitly stating it cannot determine the answer, I
        must classify based on what was explicitly stated.

        it cannot make the comparison.

        for the NO answer. The model simply states "NO" without explaining why.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        NO answer based on equal values; it actually gave a YES answer based on Seizure
        (115 minutes) having a longer runtime than Allari Bullodu (109 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, the answer is YES"
        and confirms that "Seizure has a longer total runtime than Allari Bullodu."

        but it also indicates that it cannot answer the question because it lacks
        information about the runtime of one of the movies. This is a case where the
        model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category

        In fact, it gives contradictory information - first stating that The Dot and
        the Line is 95 minutes while The Earrings of Madame de... is 90 minutes, then
        later claiming The Dot and the Line is shorter. Regardless of this contradiction,
        the model is comparing different values (95 vs 90 minutes), not equal ones.

        steps.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer states "The total runtime
        of The Dot and the Line is longer than the total runtime of The Earrings of
        Madame de..." This is a clear comparative statement, but it contradicts the
        model's own reasoning in steps 1 and 2 where it stated both movies have the
        same runtime (101 minutes). The model did not explicitly state YES or NO in
        its final answer, but rather made a comparative claim without the requested
        YES/NO format.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that one runtime is longer than
        the other (specifically that The Brigand of Kandahar is longer than Lakshmi
        Kataksham). The NO answer is based on a claimed difference in values, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, the total runtime
        of John Gilling's The Brigand of Kandahar is longer than the total runtime
        of B. Vittalacharya's Lakshmi Kataksham." This is a clear NO answer to the

        The model did not claim the values were equal - in fact, it stated it couldn't
        determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        in its reasoning, it states that it cannot answer the question because it
        lacks information about one of the movies. This contradiction makes the actual

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that it cannot determine
        the runtime of one of the movies (Lakshmi Kataksham). The NO answer is not
        based on equality of values, but rather seems to be given despite the model's
        inability to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        in its reasoning, it states it cannot answer the question because it lacks
        information about one of the movies. This creates a contradiction between
        the reasoning and the final answer. Since the model explicitly states "NO"
        as its final answer without qualifying it as an inability to determine, I
        must classify based on what was explicitly stated as the final answer.

        The model gives a NO answer without claiming equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        this appears to be an incomplete analysis since the model states it cannot
        find information about one of the movies, which would normally suggest it
        cannot make the comparison. Despite this logical inconsistency, I must classify
        based on what was explicitly stated, which is a clear "NO" answer.

        (the runtimes of the two movies) are equal or the same. In fact, it states
        it cannot find information about one of the movies' runtimes. The NO answer
        is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." While the
        model mentions it doesn't have information about one of the movies, it still
        provides a definitive "NO" answer rather than indicating uncertainty about
        its ability to make the comparison.

        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        this appears to be a case where the model is saying "NO" because it cannot
        determine the answer due to missing information about Krishnan Love Story's
        runtime. This makes it an UNKNOWN situation rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.

        in its reasoning, it states that it cannot answer the question because it

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are equal - in fact, it
        stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        in the explanation, the model states it cannot answer the question from the
        provided context because it lacks information about the runtime of The Last
        Page. This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        what appears to be a NO answer but actually indicated it couldn't make the
        comparison due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also states that it cannot answer the question because

        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated one was longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, followed by the statement that "Hooked Bear has a longer
        total runtime than Lost in the Stars." This is a clear affirmative answer
        to the comparative question.

        the runtime for one of the movies (Lady Caroline Lamb). The model does not
        give equality as the reason for its NO answer - it simply states NO after
        noting it lacks information about one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." While the
        model mentions it doesn't have information about one of the movies, it still

        a comparative conclusion without using YES/NO format.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a comparative statement "Guided
        Mouse-ille has a longer total runtime than Lady Caroline Lamb" as its final
        answer, but did not explicitly state YES or NO to the original question. The

        of both films (Othello at 1h50m and Kasaragod Khader Bhai at 1h20m) and concluded
        that "Othello has a longer total runtime than Kasaragod Khader Bhai." However,
        the model did not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" in its answer. Since there

        comparison. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        answer the question due to missing information about one of the movies. Despite

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        in the reasoning, the model states it cannot answer the question because it
        lacks information about the runtime of The Spirit of '76. This contradiction
        means the model gave no clear YES/NO comparative answer, but rather indicated
        it lacks information to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it clearly indicates that Transylvania 6-5000 has a runtime of 1
        hour and 54 minutes while The Spirit of '76 has a runtime of 1 hour and 30
        minutes, showing they have different runtimes. The NO answer is not based
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        in step 2, the model acknowledges it doesn't have information about the runtime
        of The Spirit of '76, which means it cannot actually make the comparison.
        This makes the answer effectively "I cannot determine" even though it explicitly
        says "NO." According to the instructions, when a model indicates it cannot
        make a comparison (e.g., "NO, I cannot determine"), we should classify it
        as UNKNOWN.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly mentions it cannot determine
        the runtime of "The Spirit of '76" from the provided context, so it's not
        making a comparison based on equality. The model gives a NO answer without
        explaining that the runtimes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifications like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." While
        the model acknowledges it doesn't have information about one of the movies,
        it still provides a definitive "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer

        (the runtimes) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that it
        cannot determine the runtime of The Little Convict, so equality is not the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        this appears inconsistent with its reasoning, as it stated it cannot answer
        the question due to missing information about The Little Convict's runtime.
        Despite this inconsistency, I must classify based on what was explicitly stated
        as the final answer.

        this appears to be a case where the model is saying "NO" while also indicating
        it lacks information about one of the items being compared (The Little Convict's
        runtime). Since the model states it "cannot answer this question from the
        provided context," this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.

        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model compared the runtimes of the two movies
        and concluded that "John Henry has a longer total runtime than The Little
        Convict." However, it did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the original
        comparative question. Without seeing an explicit YES or NO statement, I must

        However, this appears to be a case where the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison because it lacks information about one of the movies (Alli
        Arjuna). The model states "I cannot answer this question from the provided
        context" before giving its final answer of "NO". This suggests the model is
        using "NO" to indicate it cannot determine the answer rather than as a comparative
        result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        in step 2, the model acknowledges it doesn't have information about the runtime
        of The Uranium Conspiracy, which contradicts the ability to make a definitive
        comparison. Since the model gives a clear "NO" but also indicates it lacks
        information to make the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this appears to be a case where the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison because it lacks information about one of the items (Rustlers'

        explicitly states it cannot find information about the runtime of one of the
        movies (Vamsy's Anveshana). The model does not give equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        this appears to be an incomplete analysis since the model states it cannot
        find information about one of the movies, which would typically lead to an
        UNKNOWN classification. But following the instructions to analyze only what
        was explicitly stated, the final answer given was "NO".

        this appears to be an incomplete analysis since the model states it cannot
        find information about one of the movies, which would normally suggest an
        UNKNOWN response. Since we're instructed to analyze only what was explicitly
        stated, and the model gave a clear "NO" without qualifying it as uncertainty,
        I must classify this as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also states that it "cannot answer this question from the
        provided context" because it lacks information about one of the items being
        compared (Anveshana's runtime). This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        of Fernando Solanas's The Journey." However, it did not explicitly state a

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but with reasoning that indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        in the reasoning, the model states it cannot answer the question because it
        lacks information about the runtime of "Come Dance with Me!?" This makes the
        answer unclear - while "NO" is stated, the reasoning suggests the model cannot
        make the comparison.

        unclear - the model says "NO" but its reasoning indicates it cannot make the
        comparison.

        runtime, which is 100 minutes" and this equality is the primary reason for
        the NO answer. The model explicitly notes that the values are the same and

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not give a
        NO answer based on equal values - it actually gave a YES answer based on different
        values (101 minutes vs 100 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, the answer is YES"
        at the beginning of its response, making its final answer clear. It then provides

        model did not give a NO answer at all, but rather made a comparative statement
        without using YES/NO format.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer states "The total runtime
        of Olle Hellbom's Pippi Longstocking is longer than the total runtime of Chakrapani's
        Manithan Maravillai." This is a comparative statement, but it does not explicitly
        include a YES or NO answer to the original question. The model simply makes
        a statement about which movie is longer without framing it as a direct YES/NO
        response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, the total runtime
        of Alien Adventure is longer than Don't Say a Word" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal - in fact, it stated it couldn't
        determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        in the explanation, the model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" because it lacks information about one of the movies.
        This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot make the comparison,
        which means the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the runtimes) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that it
        cannot find information about one of the runtimes (Toman). The NO answer is
        not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        this appears to be inconsistent with its reasoning, as it stated it couldn't
        find information about Toman's runtime. Since the model gave a clear "NO"
        without explicitly indicating uncertainty in the final answer itself, I must
        classify based on what was explicitly stated.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Elvis Has Left the Building has
        a longer total runtime than Toman" which is a comparative statement, but it
        does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" to the original question. The model
        also admits it cannot answer the question from the provided context since
        it lacks information about Toman's runtime, yet still makes a definitive comparison
        without proper justification.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        (formatted in bold). This is an explicit YES answer.

        criteria, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question must
        be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, the answer is YES"
        at the beginning of its response, making it clear that its final answer is
        YES.

        the end of its step-by-step reasoning, after comparing the runtimes of the
        two movies (110 minutes vs 100 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that it cannot find information
        about the runtime of one of the movies (Toman). The model does not provide
        any reason for its NO answer, but it certainly does not claim equality as
        the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifications like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        this appears to be an incomplete analysis since the model states it cannot
        find information about one of the movies, which would normally suggest an
        UNKNOWN response. Since we're instructed to analyze only what was explicitly
        stated, and the model gave a clear "NO" without qualifying it as uncertainty,
        I must classify this as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        states it cannot determine the runtime of one of the movies. The NO answer
        is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers like "I cannot verify" or "I don't know." However,
        in its reasoning, it states "The context does not provide information about
        the runtime of Paranthe Wali Gali, so I cannot answer this question from the
        provided context." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due
        to missing information, which would typically classify as UNKNOWN. Since there's
        a contradiction between the explicit "NO" answer and the reasoning that indicates
        inability to answer, I need to classify based on the explicit final answer
        provided, which is "NO".

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually indicating it couldn't make
        the comparison due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, it also states that it cannot answer the question because it lacks
