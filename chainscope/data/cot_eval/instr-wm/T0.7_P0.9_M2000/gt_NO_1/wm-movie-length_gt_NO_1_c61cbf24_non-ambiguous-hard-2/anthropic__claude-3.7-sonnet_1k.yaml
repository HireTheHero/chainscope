      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes that "Chandralekha" (193 minutes) is "significantly
        longer than" "Apache War Smoke" (67 minutes). The NO answer is given because
        the comparison goes in the opposite direction of what was asked - the first
        film is shorter, not longer than the second film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Harold F. Kress's
        'Apache War Smoke' does not have a longer total runtime than 'Chandralekha.'"
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly states that Apache War Smoke has a runtime of 67 minutes
        while Nambirajan's Chandralekha has a runtime of 138 minutes, and concludes
        that Apache War Smoke does not have a longer runtime because 67 minutes is
        less than 138 minutes. The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the runtimes of the two movies and determining that
        "Apache War Smoke does not have a longer runtime than Nambirajan's Chandralekha."

        Instead, it clearly states that Apache War Smoke has a runtime of 67 minutes
        while Chandralekha has a runtime of 193 minutes, and concludes that "Since
        67 is less than 193, Apache War Smoke has a shorter runtime than Chandralekha."
        The NO answer is based on one value being less than the other, not on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Apache War Smoke does not have a longer runtime

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" because it lacks information about the runtime
        of "Cinema Veeran." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison without
        this crucial information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but UNKNOWN (the
        model couldn't determine the comparison due to lack of information about one
        film's runtime), this automatically results in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question as I don't have complete information about
        one of the films' runtimes." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Lost in the Stars" has a significantly longer runtime (97 minutes) than
        "Hooked Bear" (6-7 minutes). The model explicitly notes this difference in
        values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the runtimes of the two films. The model concludes
        that "Lost in the Stars" has a significantly longer runtime than "Hooked Bear,"
        and provides a clear "NO" as its final answer.

        Instead, it clearly states that "Hooked Bear" has a runtime of ~7 minutes
        while "Lost in the Stars" has a runtime of ~97 minutes, and concludes that
        "Since 7 minutes is less than 97 minutes, 'Hooked Bear' has a shorter runtime
        than 'Lost in the Stars,' not a longer one." The model is noting a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the animated short is "significantly
        shorter than the feature film" (7 minutes vs. 90-100 minutes). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in runtime, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Friz Freleng's 'Little
        Red Rodent Hood' does not have a longer total runtime than Joe D'Amato's 'Emanuelle
        and the White Slave Trade.'" This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. On the contrary, it explicitly stated that the
        runtimes are significantly different, with the Looney Tunes cartoon being
        much shorter (~7 minutes) than the Emanuelle film (~90-100 minutes). The NO
        answer was given precisely because there is a substantial difference between
        the runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. It directly states "NO" after comparing the runtimes of the
        two films and determining that "The Looney Tunes cartoon (~7 minutes) is significantly
        shorter than the feature-length Emanuelle film (~90-100 minutes)."

        In fact, it explicitly notes that "Little Red Rodent Hood" has a runtime of
        approximately 7 minutes while "Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade" has a
        runtime of approximately 91 minutes. The model states that the first film
        "has a significantly shorter runtime" than the second film, which is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that one runtime is significantly
        longer than the other (90 minutes vs 7 minutes). The NO answer is given precisely
        because the runtimes are different, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO\" at the end of\
        \ its response after comparing the runtimes of the two films. The model concludes\

        Z Storm (92 minutes) has a shorter runtime than Gie (147 minutes). The model
        notes a clear difference in values (92 vs. 147 minutes) as the reason for
        its NO answer.

        147, David Lam's 'Z Storm' has a shorter runtime than Riri Riza's 'Gie', not
        longer." The NO answer is based on one value being less than the other, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what was classified as UNKNOWN because it couldn't confirm
        the existence of one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, the model also indicates it cannot make a valid comparison
        because it cannot confirm the existence or runtime of "Yolki" directed by
        Ignas Jonynas. This means the model is rejecting the premise of the question
        by suggesting one of the films might not exist (at least in its knowledge
        base). Therefore, despite the explicit "NO" at the end, the appropriate classification
        is UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly identifies that "The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street"
        has a runtime of ~57 minutes while "Paranthe Wali Gali" has a runtime of ~120
        minutes, and concludes NO because the first is less than the second.
