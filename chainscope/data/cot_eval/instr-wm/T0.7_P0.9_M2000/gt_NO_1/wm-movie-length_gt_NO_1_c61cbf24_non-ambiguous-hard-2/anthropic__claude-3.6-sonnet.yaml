        In fact, it explicitly states that "88 is less than 157" when comparing the
        runtimes of the two movies. The NO answer is based on the fact that Last Holiday's
        runtime is shorter than Gumrah's, not that they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that "102 minutes is clearly longer than 7 minutes"
        and concludes that "Feline Frame-Up does not have a longer runtime than The
        Best Man." The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Feline Frame-Up does

        a clear negative comparative result.

        clearly much longer." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
