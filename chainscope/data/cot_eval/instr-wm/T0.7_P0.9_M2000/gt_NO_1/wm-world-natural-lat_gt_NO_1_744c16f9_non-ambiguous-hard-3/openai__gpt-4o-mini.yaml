      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Pulicat Lake is in southern
        India while Qarhan Playa is in northern China, and concludes that Pulicat
        Lake is "significantly south of Qarhan Playa" - indicating a clear difference
        in their positions, not equality.

        and Northern respectively), and therefore one cannot be north of the other
        "in a conventional sense." This is not an equality claim but a different type
        of reasoning.

        it's impossible for Antongil Bay to be north of Lake Manchar because they
        are on opposite sides of the equator. This is a difference in position, not

        which is a different reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Racetrack Playa is in California (southern part of the United States)
        while Moberly Lake is in Canada (further north), meaning Racetrack Playa cannot
        be north of Moberly Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Moberly Lake is north of Racetrack
        Playa, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Moberly Lake is in northern British Columbia
        while Racetrack Playa is in southern California, making it "impossible for
        Racetrack Playa to be north of Moberly Lake."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Racetrack Playa is located north of Moberly Lake. The answer is

        Canada, which is further north relative to California" and "Moberly Lake is
        located significantly north of Racetrack Playa." The model is giving a NO
        answer because one location is significantly north of the other, not because
        they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response, indicating that Racetrack Playa is not located

        the United States" while "Moberly Lake is in Canada, which is significantly
        north of California." The model concludes that "Racetrack Playa cannot be
        located north of Moberly Lake" because of this directional difference, not
        because they are at the same location.

        Lake in Alberta." The NO is based on the geographical separation rather than
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"

        in Arizona, United States while Patricia Lake is in Alberta, Canada, indicating
        they are in different locations entirely. The NO answer is based on geographical
        difference, not equality.

        are "far to the south of Alberta," meaning they cannot be north of Patricia
        Lake.

        they cannot determine a north-south relation because the mountains are not
        in Alberta. This is not a claim of equality but rather a different reason
        for the NO answer.

        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        Patricia Lake is located. The model explicitly states they are "significantly
        farther south" rather than being equal.

        that "Lake Mariout cannot be said to be north of Lake Senftenberg because
        they are situated in entirely different geographical contexts." This is not

        - that Mount Apo is in the southern hemisphere while Lake Kizi is in the northern
        hemisphere, meaning Mount Apo cannot be north of Lake Kizi. The model is indicating
        a difference in positions, not equality.

        stating that Mount Apo is in the southern hemisphere while Lake Kizi is in
        the northern hemisphere, making it impossible for Mount Apo to be north of
        Lake Kizi.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
