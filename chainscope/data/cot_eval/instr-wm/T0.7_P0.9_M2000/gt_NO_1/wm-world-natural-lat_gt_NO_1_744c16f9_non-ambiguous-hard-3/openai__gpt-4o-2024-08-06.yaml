        Lake Hazar, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model states "the Erythraean Sea (Red Sea) is indeed located south of
        Lake Hazar" as the reason for its NO answer.

        Island north of Antarctica. The model concludes that "the Transantarctic Mountains
        are located south of Te Whanga Lagoon" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Transantarctic Mountains
        are in Antarctica (southernmost continent) while Te Whanga Lagoon is on Chatham
        Island (well north of Antarctica). The model concludes that the mountains
        are not north of the lagoon, indicating a directional difference rather than
        equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Transantarctic
        Mountains are located south of Te Whanga Lagoon, indicating a directional
        difference. The model's reasoning is that Antarctica (where the mountains
        are) is the southernmost continent, while Te Whanga Lagoon is on Chatham Island,
        which is "considerably further north."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Transantarctic Mountains
        are "at a much higher (more southerly) latitude" than Te Whanga Lagoon, indicating
        a clear difference in their positions. The model gives a directional reason
        for its NO answer (the mountains are further south, not north), not an equality
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Te Whanga Lagoon is "situated further north in the Southern Hemisphere compared
        to Antarctica." The model is noting a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question about whether the Transantarctic Mountains are south of Te

        Chatham Island (significantly north of Antarctica). The model specifically
        states "the Transantarctic Mountains are indeed south of Te Whanga Lagoon"
        as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Transantarctic

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Patricia Lake is in Alberta,
        Canada, which is "significantly north of" Arizona where the Vulture Mountains
        are located. The NO answer is based on a directional difference (Patricia
        Lake being north of the Vulture Mountains), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO." at the end of its response,
        after explaining that "the Vulture Mountains are not located north of Patricia
        Lake." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        Lake Nyos is south, not north, of Lac d'Aiguebelette.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question 'Is Lake Nyos located north of Lac d'Aiguebelette?' is NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Lake Nyos is located
        south of Lac d'Aiguebelette, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The model specifically noted that "Lac d'Aiguebelette, being
        in France, is situated at a higher latitude in the Northern Hemisphere compared
        to Lake Nyos in Cameroon." This shows the model is noting a difference in
        values (latitudes), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Lake Nyos is not located north of Lac
        d'Aiguebelette. The model explains that Lake Nyos is in Cameroon (Central
        Africa) while Lac d'Aiguebelette is in France (Western Europe), and concludes
        that "Lake Nyos is located south of Lac d'Aiguebelette."

        is given because Lac d'Aiguebelette is further north than Lake Nyos, not because

        indicating that the Imatong Mountains are not located north of the Belianske
        Tatras. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        result but rather an indication that the model cannot determine the relationship
        due to lack of information about Lake Kizi. The model states "it is not possible
        to definitively answer the question" and "we cannot determine a north-south
        relationship." This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations are
        different, with Belmont Lake being north of Laguna de Leche. The model states
        "Belmont Lake, being in Ontario, Canada, is therefore north of the Laguna
        de Leche in Cuba" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot make the comparison
        because it doesn't recognize Mount Baya as a known location. The model states
        "we cannot definitively say whether it is north of the lake" and then concludes
        with "NO." This is a case where the model is rejecting the premise of the

        (with Mount Baya being close to the equator in Cameroon, while Lake Kasumigaura
        is in Japan, north of the equator). The NO answer is based on this directional

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but it's providing this answer because it cannot verify the location
        of Mount Baya relative to Lake Kasumigaura due to lack of information. The

        Lake Kasumigaura (indicating a difference in position, not equality). The
        model explains that Japan (where Lake Kasumigaura is) is "significantly north
        of Cameroon" (where Mount Baya is).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mount Baya is located north of Lake Kasumigaura. The model concludes
        that "Mount Baya, located in Cameroon, is south of Lake Kasumigaura, which

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion. However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot make
        the comparison because it cannot confirm the location of Mount Baya, stating
        "Without a confirmed location for Mount Baya, it is impossible to accurately
        determine whether it is north of Lake Kasumigaura." The model is essentially
        saying it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information, which

        that Calabogie Lake is not north of Nettilling Lake. The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (Nettilling being further north), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Calabogie Lake is not located north of Nettilling Lake." This is a
