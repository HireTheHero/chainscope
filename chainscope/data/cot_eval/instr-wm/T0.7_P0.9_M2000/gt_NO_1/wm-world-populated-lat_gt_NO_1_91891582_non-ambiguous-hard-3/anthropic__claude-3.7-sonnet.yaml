        explains that Munroe Island is located south of Sarmathura, not north of it,
        based on their respective latitudes.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        at different latitudes, with Sarmathura being "significantly north of Munroe
        Island" and Munroe Island being "south of Sarmathura." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Munroe Island
        is not north of Sarmathura, but rather south of it.

        is south of Motosu, Gifu," indicating a clear difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Ko Kret must be south of Nalaikh, not north."
        The model is indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct at the end of
        the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Nalaikh is north
        of Ko Kret, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The
        reason for the NO answer is that the relationship is reversed from what was
        asked (Nalaikh is north of Ko Kret, not the other way around).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        indicating that Ko Kret is not located north of Nalaikh. The model clearly
        provides a comparative result with a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Ko Kret is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Nalaikh is located north of Ko Kret, indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. The model's reasoning
        is based on their different latitudes, not on them being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Ko Kret is not located
        north of Nalaikh. Rather, Nalaikh is located north of Ko Kret." This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ko Kret is south
        of Nalaikh, indicating a clear directional difference between their locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Ko Kret is in Thailand (further south)
        while Nalaikh is in Mongolia (further north).

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Ko Kret is further south than Nalaikh (and
        Nalaikh is further north than Ko Kret). The model is giving a NO answer because
        of a directional difference, not because the locations have the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ko Kret is not located
        north of Nalaikh. Ko Kret is further south than Nalaikh." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
