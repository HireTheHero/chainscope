      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Bargal is in Somalia and
        Jezzine District is in Lebanon, and concludes that Bargal is not north of
        Jezzine District because Somalia is southeast of the Arabian Peninsula while
        Lebanon is in the Middle East to the north of Somalia. The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bargal is located north of Jezzine District. The
        answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        of Lebanon) while Jezzine District is in Lebanon, and concludes that Bargal
        "cannot be north of Jezzine District" because of their relative geographical
        positions. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Nala Local Municipality
        is located south of Agame, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Nala is in southern Africa
        while Agame is in northern Africa.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Nala Local Municipality located north of Agame?" The model
        provides a direct and explicit negative response.

        indicating a clear directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        (southern part of Africa) while Agame is in Ethiopia (northeastern part of
        Africa), and concludes that "Nala Local Municipality is located south of Agame."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        reason for the NO answer is that Nala is south of Agame, not that they are
        at the same location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are equal.\
        \ Instead, it explicitly states that \"Lumle is significantly north of Thiruparankundram\"\
        \ and provides different latitude values (Thiruparankundram at around 9.9\xB0\
        \ N and Lumle at around 28.2\xB0 N). The NO answer is based on this difference\
        \ in position, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question, 'Is Thiruparankundram Dargah located north of Lumle?' is **NO**."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Thiruparankundram Dargah
        is in southern India while Lumle is in northern part of the Indian subcontinent,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based on Thiruparankundram
        being south of Lumle, not on them being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lumle is to the
        north of Thiruparankundram Dargah" and "India (where Thiruparankundram is
        located) is south of Nepal (where Lumle is located)." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are equal.\
        \ Instead, it explicitly notes that Lumle is at a higher latitude (28.2\xB0\
        \ N) than Thiruparankundram (9.9\xB0 N), and concludes that Lumle is located\

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that Thiruparankundram Dargah is in southern India while Lumle is
        in Nepal which is "significantly north of India." The model is indicating
        a clear directional difference (one is south, one is north) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is **NO**" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.
