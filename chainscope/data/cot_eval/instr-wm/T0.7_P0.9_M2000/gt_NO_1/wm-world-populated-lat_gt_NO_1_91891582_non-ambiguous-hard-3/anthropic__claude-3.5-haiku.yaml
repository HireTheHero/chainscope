      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion section and as a standalone answer at the end. The

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, explaining that "Tamil Nadu is in the southernmost part
        of India" while "Jammu and Kashmir is in the northernmost part of India" and
        concludes that "Namakkal district cannot be north of Uri" because of this
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO, Namakkal
        district is NOT located north of Uri, Jammu and Kashmir" and concludes with
        "NO" as its final answer.

        a clear directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" as its

        because the values are the same, but rather because it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        information about Sarmathura's location. The model explains "NO (I do not
        have sufficient information to confidently say YES)" which indicates it cannot
        verify the comparison rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.

        give a NO answer based on equal values; it expressed uncertainty about making
        the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" due to uncertainty about Sarmathura's location.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. The model did not give a NO
        answer because the values being compared are the same, but rather because
        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's clear from the explanation that the model is saying "NO" because
        it cannot confirm the positioning with certainty, not as a comparative result.
        The model states "I cannot determine whether Munroe Island is north or south
        of it" and "I do not have enough information to confidently answer." This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        say NO, but I want to be clear that this is not based on certain knowledge."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information,

        The reason for the NO answer is that Munroe Island is south of Sarmathura,

        answers NO to whether Munroe Island is north of Sarmathura.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Munroe Island is north of Sarmathura. The model provides a direct
