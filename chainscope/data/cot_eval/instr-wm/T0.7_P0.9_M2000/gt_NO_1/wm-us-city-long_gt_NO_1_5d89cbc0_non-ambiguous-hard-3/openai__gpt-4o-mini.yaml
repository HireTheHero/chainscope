        for Kieler, WI vs -83.9 degrees for Essexville, MI) and concludes that "Kieler
        is actually west of Essexville." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

        approximately -100.4 degrees and Biwabik at approximately -92.4 degrees) and
        concludes that "Parshall's longitude is further west than Biwabik's." The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to
        the comparative question of whether Parshall, ND is located east of Biwabik,
        MN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether White Pigeon, MI is located east of Reynolds Heights,
