      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that White Pigeon, MI is not east of Reynolds Heights,
        PA. This is a clear negative comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model clearly determined that Fairmead, CA is not east
        of Red Mesa, AZ (it's west of it), and provided this as a definitive comparative
        result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after providing a step-by-step reasoning about the longitudes of
        La Vergne, TN and Vander, NC. The model concludes that "La Vergne, TN is west
