      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that one location (Cedar Crest,
        MA) cannot be precisely located, making a definitive comparison impossible.
        The model even notes that Ohio is generally west of Massachusetts. The NO
        answer appears to be based on the inability to make the comparison rather
        than on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While it does explain that "Cedar Crest, MA" doesn't appear to be
        a recognized place and that the question cannot be answered definitively,
        it ultimately provides a clear "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Cedar Crest, MA is east of Bloomdale, OH. Despite
        initially expressing uncertainty about the exact location of Cedar Crest,
        MA, the model ultimately provides a definitive YES answer based on the general
        geography of Massachusetts being east of Ohio.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        provides a step-by-step analysis of the longitudes and concludes that "Bloomdale,

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Pine Haven, WY located east of Hugo, MN?" The model explains
        that Hugo, MN is east of Pine Haven, WY, and therefore Pine Haven, WY is west
        of Hugo, MN, leading to the NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pine Haven, WY is

        The reason for the NO answer is that Pine Haven is west of Hugo, not east
        as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Pine Haven, WY is located east of Hugo, MN. The model explicitly

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Duson, LA is west
        of Fort Rucker, AL" and that "southwestern Louisiana is further west than
        southeastern Alabama," indicating a difference in longitude rather than equality.
        The NO answer appears to be in response to the original question (likely asking
        if Duson is east of Fort Rucker).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.
