      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Blende would be
        west of Florissant (indicating a difference in position), which is the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Blende is east of Florissant. The model provides reasoning that
        Blende is in Colorado (west) while Florissant is in Missouri (east), concluding
        that Blende would be west of Florissant, not east of it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Blende, CO is west
        of Florissant, MO, indicating a directional difference. The model's reasoning
        is that Colorado is west of Missouri, and therefore Blende must be west of
        Florissant, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Blende, CO is east of Florissant, MO. The model
        clearly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step reasoning.

        of Florissant, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Blende is NOT
        east of Florissant (it's west of it)" and ends with "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite relationship is true - that Cascades, VA is east of Lakeside
        Park, KY (not that Lakeside Park is east of Cascades). The model identified
        a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question about whether
        Lakeside Park, KY is east of Cascades, VA. The model explains its reasoning
        by determining that Virginia is east of Kentucky, so Cascades would be east
        of Lakeside Park, not the other way around.

        of Lakeside Park, KY (not the other way around). The model clearly indicates
        a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model determined that Cascades, VA is east of Lakeside Park, KY (not the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Watterson Park is west of
        Westphalia (not east), indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model's reasoning is based on the geographic positions of Kentucky
        and Maryland, concluding that Watterson Park must be west of Westphalia, not
        east.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Mogul, NV is west of Hot Sulphur Springs, CO, not east as the question
        asked. The model explicitly states "Mogul, NV must be west of Hot Sulphur
        Springs, CO" and "Hot Sulphur Springs, CO is east of Mogul, NV" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mogul, NV is east of Hot Sulphur Springs, CO. The
