      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to the uncertainty about the existence of Blende, CO." The
        model is indicating it cannot make the comparison because it cannot confirm
        the existence of one of the locations being compared.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question"
        because it cannot confirm the existence of one of the locations (Blende, CO).
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but UNKNOWN, this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer due to the uncertainty
        about the existence of Blende, CO." The model is rejecting the premise of
        the question because it cannot find one of the locations (Blende, CO).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the geographical relationship
        because one of the locations (Blende, CO) appears to be fictional or mistaken.
        The model is rejecting the premise of the question since it believes one location
        doesn't exist.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Blende, CO is west of Florissant, MO, not
        east" because "Colorado is located west of Missouri in the United States."
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to lack of verifiable information." The model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison because it cannot confirm the cities' locations.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO.
        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" after explaining that it cannot confirm the
        location of one of the places. This indicates the model is unable to make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates that it cannot make the comparison because one
        of the cities (Blende) "does not appear to exist." The model is rejecting
        the premise of the question by suggesting one location doesn't exist.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and concludes with "Cannot determine (insufficient information)".
        The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to uncertainty about one of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        the premise of the question due to the uncertainty of Blende, CO's existence)".
        This is a case where the model is rejecting the premise of the question by
        stating that one of the locations doesn't exist or is unverifiable. According
        to the criteria, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Bloomdale, OH is definitively
        west of Cedar Crest, MA" which indicates a difference in location. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ohio is west of Massachusetts,
        and therefore Bloomdale (in Ohio) would be west of Cedar Crest (in Massachusetts).
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Bloomdale, OH is NOT east of Cedar Crest,

        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that "Maple Lake is southwest
        of Mole Lake" which indicates a directional difference. The model explicitly
        states that "Maple Lake is NOT east of Mole Lake" because it is southwest,
        not because they are at the same location or longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, indicating that Maple Lake, MN is NOT east of Mole Lake, WI.
        The answer is explicitly stated as "NO" in step 4 and then repeated as a standalone
        "NO" at the very end.

        at the end of its response. While the model explains that it cannot confirm
        the geographic relationship due to uncertainty about the locations, it explicitly
        provides "NO" as its final answer.
