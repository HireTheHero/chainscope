      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Wei Zifu was born
        around 150 BCE while Antiochus XII was born around 115 BCE, and concludes
        that Wei Zifu was born earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the birth dates and concluding that Wei Zifu was born earlier,
        not later than Antiochus XII.

        The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the birth dates, where it determined Wei Zifu was born
        earlier than Antiochus XII Dionysus. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        born EARLIER (around 360-370 CE) compared to Melania (383 CE), indicating
        a difference in their birth dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the birth dates and determining that Sima Yuanxian was born
        EARLIER than Melania.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in birth years (382 CE vs 383 CE) and concluded NO because one was earlier
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Sima Yuanxian was born EARLIER than Melania the Younger. This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the figures were born
        at the same time. In fact, it concludes that Zhu Ling was "probably born before
        Sima Lang," indicating a difference in birth years. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it suggests Zhu Ling was "slightly older than or around
        the same age" and concludes he was "most likely not born later than" Sima
        Lang, indicating a difference (even if slight) rather than equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and maintains
        this answer in its final parenthetical statement, indicating that Zhu Ling
        was most likely not born later than Sima Lang.

        was not used to justify a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear

        being similar or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it notes some uncertainty about exact dates. Since there is a

        the same time or slightly earlier than Sima Lang" and concludes NO based on
        evidence suggesting he was not born later. The presence of even potential
        difference ("slightly earlier") means this is not a case of equal values being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a comparative conclusion even while noting some uncertainty. While
        there is uncertainty mentioned, it's presented as qualifying context rather
        than preventing a determination.

        year while noting Sima Lang's specific birth year (171 CE). The NO answer
        appears to be based on insufficient evidence to confirm the comparison, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even though it notes uncertainty. Since it provides a clear NO answer
        (not refusing to answer or saying it cannot determine), this should be classified
        as NO.

        it ultimately concludes NO based on the likelihood that Zhu Ling was NOT born
        after Sima Lang (indicating a temporal difference). The model does not state
        they were born at exactly the same time, and the NO is based on a directional
        comparison rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that 1603 comes before 1604, indicating a difference in values, not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states Khabarov was born EARLIER than
        Bosse.

        being equal. While it notes they were "essentially contemporaries" and born
        "within 1-2 years of each other," it explicitly mentions there are overlapping
        but different possible birth dates (1602-1604 vs around 1603). The NO answer
        appears to be based on comparing commonly cited dates, not on the dates being
        exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model initially expresses uncertainty and
        reluctance to give a definitive answer, it ultimately provides "NO" as its
        final answer, even though it qualifies this with "very low confidence." Since
        we're instructed to take the explicit final answer when one is given, this
        should be classified as NO.

        on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in birth years (1084 vs 1160) and concluded NO based on this difference. The
        values being compared were not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Mo Zichun was born earlier than Abu
        Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the birth dates are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states there is a temporal difference of "approximately
        100 years" between them. The NO answer is based on the fact that Zhuge Hui
        lived earlier, not because of any equality in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after walking through the chronological comparison, indicating
        Zhuge Hui could not have been born later than Joseph of Tiberias because he
        lived earlier.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the birth dates are equal. Instead, it concludes that Zhuge Hui lived earlier
        than Joseph of Tiberias (died 263 CE vs lived in 300s CE), making their birth
        dates different. The NO answer is given because the comparison goes in the
        opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Zhuge Hui was not
        born later than Joseph of Tiberias)" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO comparative result.

        "appears to have been born earlier than Joseph of Tiberias." The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in time periods
        (3rd century vs 4th century) and used this difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the chronological order of the two figures, determining
        that Zhuge Hui came before Joseph of Tiberias.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different birth periods (late 3rd
        century for Joseph vs early 4th century for Zhuge Hui) and concluded NO because
        Zhuge Hui was actually born later, not earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and clarified

        than Joseph of Tiberias" and gave different time periods for their lives.
        The NO answer was based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the timeline of both historical figures.
        This was a clear negative response to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's
        discussion of both figures being active in the same time period is not relevant
        since it didn't give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient historical records. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the birth dates are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states a difference, concluding that Zhuge
        Hui was likely born earlier (in late 3rd century) compared to Joseph of Tiberias
        (suggested later birth date in mid-4th century). The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in timing (Marina being born before Lucian), not because they were born at
        the same time. The model explicitly states "Marina was likely born BEFORE
        Lucian of Samosata."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they were born "around the same
        time or slightly before," this actually indicates a small difference (with
        Marina being slightly before), not exact equality. The presence of "slightly
        before" means they're not described as exactly equal.

        in timing (Marina being born before Lucian), not because the birth dates were
        equal. The model explicitly states "Marina was likely born before Lucian"
        as its reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the birth dates are equal. In fact, the model explicitly concludes that Marina
        was born before Lucian, indicating a difference in timing rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after reasoning
        through the timeline, indicating that one person was born before the other
        (specifically that Marina was born before Lucian).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they were "rough contemporaries,"
        it explicitly states that Marina was "likely born slightly earlier than Lucian."
        Since it identifies a difference (even if slight) rather than exact equality
        as the basis for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - instead,
        it explicitly concludes that Marina was born before Lucian based on their
        different time periods (Marina being martyred by 139 AD while Lucian was born
        around 125 AD). The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1011 comes before
        1016, showing a difference in birth years. The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(Shao
        Yong was not born later than Abbad II al-Mu'tadid)" as its final comparative
        answer. This is a clear NO response to whether Shao Yong was born later.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that 1011 comes before 1016 and used this difference
        as the basis for its NO answer. The values being compared (birth years 1011
        and 1016) were different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Shao Yong was born earlier than Abbad II al-Mu'tadid. This is a clear
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in birth years (158 AH vs 159 AH) and uses this difference to conclude that
        Yahya ibn Ma'in was born first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Yahya ibn Ma'in was not born later than Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah. This is
        a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (158 AH)
        comes before the other (159 AH), and uses this difference to conclude that
        Yahya was born first, not later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific dates for both scholars,
        it does not state that they were born at the same time. In fact, it explicitly
        notes a difference (158 AH vs 159 AH) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The NO is based on the first person being born earlier,
        not on equal birth dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        explanation that Yahya ibn Ma'in was born earlier, not later, than Abu Bakr
        ibn Abi Shaybah. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different birth dates
        (578 BCE vs 590-580 BCE) and concludes NO because Yan Ying was born after
        Anaxandridas II, not because the dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Anaxandridas II
        was born about 10-12 years before Yan Ying," indicating a clear difference
        in birth dates. The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Yan Ying
        was not born later than Anaxandridas II)" as a direct comparative answer.
        The model determined that Anaxandridas II was actually born first, making
        this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in birth dates (12-22 years), and this difference is the reason for the NO
        answer. It does not claim the dates are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the birth dates and determining Anaxandridas II was born before
        Yan Ying.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares the dates, it does not state
        that the birth dates are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that Yan
        Ying (580 BCE) was born before Anaxandridas II (before 560 BCE), indicating
        a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states "Yan Ying was NOT born later than Anaxandridas II" as a comparative
        result.

        in birth dates, with Anaxandridas II being born "about 10-20 years before
        Yan Ying". Since the NO answer is based on a difference in values rather than
        equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Yan Ying was not born later than Anaxandridas
        II, with specific dates to support this conclusion.

        birth dates are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference of
        10-20 years between their births, with Anaxandridas II being born before Yan
        Ying.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Yan Ying
        was not born later than Anaxandridas II" and provides a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Wenceslaus
        was born in 1413 and Albrecht in 1414, showing different values with Wenceslaus
        being earlier. The NO was not due to equal values but due to finding a difference
        in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the birth dates and determining that Wenceslaus I was born

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1227 comes before 1266 and
        that Chiba Munetane was born earlier than Beatrice Portinari. The NO is based
        on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Chiba Munetane was born earlier than Beatrice Portinari,
        directly answering whether he was born later than her.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Theophanes was born earlier than Cleopatra VI. This is a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in birth dates ("Theophanes was born about 20-25 years BEFORE Cleopatra VI")
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        values (birth dates) are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that
        Theophanes was likely born before Cleopatra VI, indicating a difference in
        timing. The NO appears to be a direct response to a question about whether
        Cleopatra VI was born before Theophanes (with NO meaning the opposite was
        true).

        was "likely born before 95-85 BC when Cleopatra VI was born" - indicating
        a difference in birth dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Theophanes

        Cleopatra VI" and provides reasoning about the relative timing differences
        between them.

        was born BEFORE Cleopatra VI (around 110-100 BC vs 95-85 BC), not because
        the dates were equal. It explicitly noted a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        the same time. Instead, it indicates "Cleopatra VI was born earlier than or
        around the same time as Theophanes" and gives slightly different estimated
        birth ranges for each person. Since it notes a possible difference (with Cleopatra
        potentially being born earlier), this is not a case of equal values being
        the reason for the NO answer.

        and van Noort in 1561/1562, making them possibly born in the same year, this
        is not presented as the reason for the NO answer. Rather, the NO is because
        Yi Eokgi was "either born in the same year or earlier than van Noort" - allowing
        for potential difference in birth years. Since the model acknowledges possible
        different values and doesn't base its NO answer solely on equality, this should
        be classified as False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values (birth dates) are equal. The model explicitly states that Chu Liang
        lived several centuries before Wu Shihuo and died before Wu Shihuo was born.
        The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the chronological order of Wu Shihuo and Chu Liang's lives.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        - it actually estimates different dates (320-290 BC for Song Yu vs 240-230
        BC for Ziying) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that William was born around
        1280 while Alice was born in 1287, and concludes that "1280 comes before 1287".
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.

    0a3ff4f9-cbf4-4736-b409-4a90adf9ce5c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the birth dates are equal/same
        as the reason for NO. Instead, it states Sabinus was "likely born before or
        around the same time" and concludes NO because Sabinus was not born later.
        The possibility of being born before means they're not treated as equal values.

        of any discussion of the figures being contemporaries or from similar time
        periods.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "CANNOT BE DETERMINED"
        and notes that while a YES/NO was requested, it cannot make that determination
        due to insufficient information. The model is indicating it cannot verify
        the comparison due to missing birth date information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the birth dates
        were equal - it actually indicated uncertainty about Sabinus's birth date.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it immediately qualifies
        this by stating it's due to insufficient evidence to make the determination
        ("because there isn't enough evidence to conclude"). This indicates the model
        cannot actually determine the comparison, making this effectively a statement
        of inability to verify rather than a comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they were "rough contemporaries,"
        it explicitly states "Sabinus was born slightly before or around the same
        time as Huiyuan." The mention of "slightly before" indicates a difference,
        even if small. Since the model indicates a directional difference rather than
        exact equality, this does not qualify as equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.

        of overlapping date ranges is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as
        the reason for a NO answer when the final answer is actually NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot conclusively say...)"
        indicating it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the model
        explicitly states it cannot verify/determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN
        rather than a NO comparative result.

        possible birth date for Wykes (1223), it would be the same year as Eleanor's
        birth, this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer. Rather, the
        NO is given because Wykes was "not born later than Eleanor" - indicating a
        temporal relationship rather than equality as the reason for the negative
        answer.

        did not claim the birth dates were equal - it stated there was uncertainty
        in one date that prevented comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explains this is because
        it "cannot conclusively say" due to uncertainty in dates. This is equivalent
        to saying it cannot determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather
        than a definitive NO comparative result.

        it as NO, the model doesn't state the birth dates are equal - it states there
        is uncertainty and overlap in the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (based on available historical
        records, we cannot confirm that Thomas Wykes was born later than Eleanor of
        Provence)" - this is a statement indicating inability to determine/verify
        the comparison, not a comparative NO. When a model states it cannot confirm/verify/determine

        born "either before or around the same time." Since it includes "before" as
        a possibility and doesn't definitively state they were born at the same time,
        this is not a case of equal values being the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        states Wykes was "either slightly before or around the same time." The inclusion
        of "slightly before" as a possibility means it's not stating they were definitively
        equal/same, and equality is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        for Hugbert) that overlap but aren't stated to be identical. The NO answer
        appears to be based on inability to confirm Othmar was born later, not on
        them being born at the exact same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it notes low confidence. Since it provides a clear NO as a comparative

        991, indicating a difference in values, and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        of the individuals being "roughly contemporaries" is irrelevant since we only
        evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot make a definitive
        YES/NO determination" and "I must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer." This
        is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the birth years are
        equal - it explicitly notes that Julia was born in 19 BC while Arminius was
        born in 18/17 BC, and uses this difference to conclude that Julia was born
        earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Julia was born earlier, not later than
        Arminius.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating
        that 19 BC came before 18/17 BC and that Julia was born EARLIER than Arminius.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the birth dates are equal/same
        - it explicitly states Julia was born in 19 BC and Arminius in 18/17 BC, and
        concludes Julia was born BEFORE Arminius. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Julia was not born later than Arminius, with step-by-step

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found Ishikawa Ishiashi
        was born approximately 20 years before Al-Walid I, indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality. The NO was based on this difference, not on
        the values being the same.

        were born around the same time ("likely contemporaries with birth dates close
        to each other"), this is irrelevant since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO - Based on the available
        information, we cannot definitively say..." This is a statement indicating
        inability to determine the comparison, not a comparative NO. The model explicitly
        states it cannot make a definitive determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Taft was born approximately
        8 months before van Rappard, indicating a difference in dates. The NO answer
        was given because Taft was born earlier, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the birth dates and determining that Taft was born before
        van Rappard.

        was born EARLIER than van Rappard (1857 vs 1858), not because the dates were
        equal. It explicitly noted a difference in the years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the birth dates and determining that Taft was born earlier,
        not later, than van Rappard.
