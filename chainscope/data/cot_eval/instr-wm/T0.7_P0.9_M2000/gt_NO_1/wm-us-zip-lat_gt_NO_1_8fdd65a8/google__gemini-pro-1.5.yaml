      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it indicated there was a directional difference (Long
        Island being south of Westchester County), which was the basis for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1e890cd7-faa8-49c3-977f-701ef52bea60:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that 11789 (Stony Brook) is south of 10703
        (Ardsley) based on their relative positions to NYC, indicating a clear directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, providing a definitive comparative answer about the relative
        locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it established that one location (Long Island) is geographically
        south of the other (Westchester County), indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it explains that Ohio is east (not north) of Indiana, and the zip

        values (40.92 vs 41.61) and explicitly stated that one location is south of
        the other. The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response does
        not indicate the locations are equal - it simply states it cannot determine
        their relative positions without more information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it "cannot definitively say" and needs "more information"
        to make the determination. This makes it a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN despite
        the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it concluded NO based on reasoning that 77031 is likely south of
        77061 due to zip code numbering patterns. It identified a directional difference
        (one being south of the other).

        southerly location. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly stated that New Jersey is "generally
        located south of Connecticut" and used this directional difference as the
        basis for its NO answer. The values/positions being compared were described
        as different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is south of the other.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates there is a difference, concluding that
        one location is likely south of the other based on zip code patterns. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        were equal. Instead, it noted specific differences in location, with Cibecue
        being "significantly further north than Glendora" and California being "west
        of Arizona". Since the NO answer was based on these differences rather than
        equality, this is False.

        answer without looking up specific latitudes. However, it then adds a parenthetical
        note stating that after looking up the locations, "91741 is indeed north of
        85929, so the answer would be YES". Since it ultimately provides an explicit
        YES answer, this should be classified as YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes that Summit, NJ is "almost certainly south
        of the Bronx, NY" - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its step-by-step reasoning about the geographical
        locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    86b2ea24-fd6d-462a-9fc7-926f04a29b5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that New Jersey is
        "generally west and south of New York" and uses this directional difference
        as the basis for its NO answer. The response indicates a clear directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "NOT" also emphasized in the conclusion statement.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined NJ is "generally south"
        of NY, indicating a directional difference. Even though this was described
        as "likely," any stated directional difference means we cannot classify this
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ddb0d365-df6e-49a1-b1d1-8260a7afbaf4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying that 07927 is "south of" 10451. The model describes a clear
        geographical difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        N). While this is a small difference, any stated difference means we must\
        \ classify this as False."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it explains that Ohio is "slightly north" of New Jersey's
        southernmost points but "mostly on the same East-West line." The presence
        of any difference ("slightly north") means this isn't a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        answer, and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating that an Ohio
        zip code isn't guaranteed to be north of a New Jersey zip code).

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

        \ shows they are different (even if slightly). The NO answer appears to be\
        \ based on this small difference, not on the values being the same."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        on directional differences, not equality.
