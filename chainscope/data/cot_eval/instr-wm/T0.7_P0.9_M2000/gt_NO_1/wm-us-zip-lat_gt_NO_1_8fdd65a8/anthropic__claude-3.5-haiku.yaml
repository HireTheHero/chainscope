      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one
        location (11789/Long Island) is south of the other location (10703/Westchester),
        indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether one zip code

        \ N, and concluded NO based on this difference."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 11789, NY
        is NOT located north of 10703, NY" after comparing the latitudes and finding

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the values were equal - it actually found them to be different

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes differences between the zip codes (90048 vs 91803)
        and uses these differences to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on one location being south of the other, not on equality.

        final answer after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative
        judgment that 37918 is not north of 37221.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "roughly
        at similar latitudes" and "similar," it doesn't explicitly state they are
        exactly equal. The model's NO answer appears to be based on the fact that
        they are similar in latitude, not exactly equal. Any indication of similarity
        rather than exact equality should be classified as False according to the
        criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 21074 is SOUTH
        of 81632, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct answer without
        any caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (southwest vs southeast locations), not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states one is southwest while the other is southeast, indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reasoning (77031 is NOT

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a difference in location,
        stating that 77031 is south of 77061. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 77031, TX is NOT
        located north of 77061, TX" as its final answer. This is a clear NO comparative

    096a28d9-3e34-4fde-acfe-052f0d59563d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that Louisiana's latitudes are "generally south
        of Alabama's latitudes" and concluded that 71047 would be "south of" 36064.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - instead, it explicitly stated that Louisiana's latitude range is lower
        than Alabama's and concluded that 71047 is "most likely located south of"
        36064. The NO answer was based on a difference in values (one being south
        of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result, indicating that the first location is not further

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is south/southwest
        of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between the two points.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Answer: NO" as
        its final comparative answer. This is an explicit NO response to the comparison.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Louisiana being south of Alabama) rather than the locations being equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (south vs north)
        between the locations, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, making this a definitive NO answer to the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the directional
        difference (Louisiana being south of Alabama), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Answer: NO" after
        explaining why the Louisiana zip code is not north of the Alabama zip code.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating "Louisiana is
        generally situated west of Alabama" and "the Louisiana zip code is actually
        south of the Alabama zip code". The NO answer is based on these positional
        differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Louisiana being south of Alabama) rather than the locations being equal/identical.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference (one is south of the
        other).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Louisiana is south of Alabama), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position, with
        one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Louisiana is south
        of Alabama and concludes the NO answer is because 71047 is south of (not equal
        to) 36064's latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis showing
        that 71047 is south of, not north of, 36064.

    7dd8daed-3c7d-4b68-bbee-f75c716fa2e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference between the zip codes (70510 vs
        70528) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is
        based on 70510 being south of 70528, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "So the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.'

    90ef69ac-5248-42fb-a118-bd1bfb75a7d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other, not because they are equal. It explicitly
        states "Abbeville (70510) is south of Mamou (70528)" indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison
        showing that 70510 is south of 70528 (not north).'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually
        found a difference between the locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step reasoning

    b1c9a257-d0dd-43c9-889d-9cb7d3c5c4da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes they are different (70510 vs 70528) and concludes
        NO because 70510 is determined to be further south than 70528, not because
        they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions
        of the zip codes.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 70510 is SOUTH of
        70528 (indicating different locations), and bases its NO answer on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, without any caveats about uncertainty
        or inability to determine.

    e292eff2-27f9-4d7b-8e8a-9d2b952ce74e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes or locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that 70510 is lower
        than 70528 and concludes it is likely located south (not north) of 70528.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        twice - both in the final line of reasoning and as a standalone answer at
        the end. This is a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with the Texas zip code being south of the New Mexico one. This
        directional difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.

        instead, it explicitly noted differences in position, stating that Hitchcock
        (77510) is "further north and east" compared to San Antonio (78211). The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly describes differences in their positions, noting that
        San Antonio is "further west and somewhat south" while Texas City is "closer
        to the Gulf Coast and east/southeast"
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        78211 is south of 77510, indicating a directional difference between the locations
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (78211 being south of 77510) to support this answer.
