      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence.
        Throughout the lengthy analysis, the model explores various possibilities

        that one location (33993/Bokeelia) is north of the other location (33905/Tice),
        indicating a clear directional difference between them. The NO answer was

        positions (Division St being south of North Ave), not because the values were

        800 N. The NO was because 60651 is south of 60622, not because they are at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including

        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends abruptly
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model explores various possibilities
        about the locations but never commits to a final comparative answer about
        whether 92025 is north of 92029.

        The model never reached a definitive conclusion about equality or inequality
        of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off and never reached
        a final conclusion. Throughout the response, it repeatedly considers different
        possibilities and changes direction multiple times, showing uncertainty about
        the locations of the zip codes. While it occasionally suggests "NO" as a possibility
        when considering specific scenarios, it never commits to a final answer.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought and never provides
        a clear YES/NO answer. While it explores various possibilities about zip code
        patterns and locations, it doesn't reach a definitive conclusion. The response
        appears to be an incomplete thought process without a final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the zip codes are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that
        33042 is located north of 33040 along the Florida Keys, indicating different
        locations. The NO is based on 33040 being south of 33042, not because they're

        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location was
        south of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer was given because Key West (33040) is south of
        Marathon (33042), not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        locations. The answer is supported by explaining that 33040 (Key West) is
        south of 33042 (Marathon).

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a definitive answer. While it briefly considers "NO" at one point,
        it immediately questions that conclusion ("But wait, if 33042 is actually
        in a different area... I need to verify.") and ends without making a final

        throughout and doesn't provide a final comparative answer about which location

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        also did not explicitly state the values were equal - it actually suggested
        slight differences at various points.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO answer about whether 19131 is north of 19134. While

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, ending mid-sentence
        with "So the answer". While the model seems to be leaning towards YES in its
        reasoning (mentioning "19131 is indeed north of 19134"), it never explicitly
        states a final YES/NO answer before cutting off. Without an explicit final

        latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
