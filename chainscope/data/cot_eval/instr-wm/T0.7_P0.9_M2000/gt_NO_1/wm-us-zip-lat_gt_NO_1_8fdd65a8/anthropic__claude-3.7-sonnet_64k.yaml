      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or identical latitude values. Instead, it explains that Yonkers (10703) is
        north of Sound Beach (11789), indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model specifically states "Westchester County (where
        Yonkers is) is positioned north of Long Island" and "Yonkers (10703) is north
        of Sound Beach (11789)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 11789, NY is not located
        north of 10703, NY" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that 19134 is "further
        north" or "at a higher latitude" than 19131. The model concludes that "the
        neighborhoods in zip code 19134 are at a higher latitude (further north) than
        those in zip code 19131." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        of 19131 (the opposite of what was asked). The model states "19134 is actually
        north of 19131, not the other way around" and "Areas in North/Northeast Philadelphia
        (including 19134) are generally more northerly than areas in West Philadelphia
