      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 11789 NY is located south
        of 10703 NY, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 11789 NY is not located
        north of 10703 NY. It is located south of it." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with Sound Beach (11789) being south of Yonkers (10703).
        The model clearly indicates a directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether ZIP code 11789 in New York is located
        north of ZIP code 10703 in New York. The answer is direct and unambiguous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after determining that Sound Beach (11789) is located slightly further
        north than Yonkers (10703) based on latitude comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are equal\
        \ as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it states that Sound Beach is\
        \ \"east and slightly south\" of Yonkers. Even though it mentions they are\
        \ at approximately the same latitude (40.9\xB0 N), it specifically notes that\
        \ Sound Beach is \"slightly south of Yonkers\" - indicating a difference in\
        \ position, not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 11789 (Sound Beach,
        NY) is not located north of 10703 (Yonkers, NY)." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with 10703 (Yonkers) being north of 11789 (Sound Beach). The model
        explains that Westchester County is north of Long Island, making 11789 south
        of 10703, not equal to it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 11789, NY located north of 10703, NY?" The model clearly
        concludes that 11789 is NOT north of 10703 after analyzing their geographical
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sound Beach (11789)
        is south of Yonkers (10703), indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is 11789, NY located north of 10703, NY?" The

    8e81a2e3-3535-4efb-ae3b-84d126a15ade:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Sound Beach on
        Long Island is south of the latitude of Yonkers" and "Westchester County (where
        Yonkers is) lies north of Long Island." The model is indicating a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that zip code 11789 is not north of zip code 10703. The model provides

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Yonkers (10703) is north of Sound Beach
        (11789), indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        model even states "In fact, it's the opposite - Yonkers is north of Sound
        Beach." This shows the model is noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 11789 (Sound Beach,
        NY) is not located north of 10703 (Yonkers, NY)." This is an explicit NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        have different positions, with 11789 (Ronkonkoma) being south of 10703 (Yonkers).
        The model clearly indicates a directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 11789, NY is located north of 10703, NY. The answer is explicitly
        stated at the end of the response, followed by the explanation "11789, NY
        is NOT located north of 10703, NY. It's actually located south of it."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ffe3e114-0dfa-4872-8d09-94057d2cbd9b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Yonkers (10703) being north of Sound Beach (11789). The model
        gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is 11789, NY located north of 10703, NY?" The
        model explains that Yonkers (10703) is north of Sound Beach (11789), not the
        other way around.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "The latitudes are
        very similar, but Corning, CA is actually slightly further north than Darby,
        PA." The model is noting a difference in values (CA being "slightly further
        north"), even if it's a small difference. This difference, not equality, is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 19023, PA is not
        located north of 96021, CA." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "They are
        at very similar latitudes, with 19023 being slightly further south." The model
        indicates 19023 is slightly further south than 96021, which is why it answered
        NO. Even though the latitudes are described as "very similar," the model clearly
        identifies a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 19023, PA is not
        located north of 96021, CA." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        \ N latitude\". The model identifies a small difference in latitude as the\
        \ reason for its NO answer, not equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 19023, PA is located north of 96021, CA. The answer is clearly

        \ identical latitudes\" and \"both positioned along nearly the same east-west\
        \ line across the United States. Neither is significantly north of the other.\"\
        \ The model explicitly notes that they are at approximately the same latitude\
        \ (39.9\xB0 N for both locations) and this equality is the primary reason\
        \ for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 19023, PA is not located north of 96021, CA. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

        \ model's NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, then realized
        it made an error in its latitude assessment. After correction, it maintained
        the "NO" answer, stating that "Since 96021 has a higher latitude than 19023,
        the California location is further north." This is a clear NO answer to the
        question of whether 19023, PA is located north of 96021, CA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the primary reason for its NO answer. While it notes the latitudes
        are similar ("at a similar or slightly higher latitude"), it actually concludes
        that "Corning, CA is typically slightly north of Darby, PA" - indicating a
        small difference rather than equality. The model is saying NO because 96021
        is slightly north of 19023, not because they're exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 19023, PA is not north of 96021, CA. This is a clear
        negative comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 33993 is actually further
        north than 33905, stating "Cape Coral's northern areas (where 33993 is located)
        are generally further north than eastern Fort Myers (33905)" and "33993 specifically
        is in the northern part of Cape Coral, while 33905 is more central/southern
        in its region." The model is indicating a difference in north-south positioning
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"YES\" at the end of\
        \ its response after determining that Glendora, CA (91741) is at a higher\
