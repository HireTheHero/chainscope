      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Lake Ronkonkoma (11789) is
        located south of Yonkers (10703). The NO answer is given because one location
        is south of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that 11789, NY is
        not located north of 10703, NY.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly described them as being in different
        positions, with Yonkers being north of Islip Terrace on Long Island. The NO
        answer was given because one location was determined to be south of the other,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with a boxed "NO" answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions of the two zip codes. The answer
        was clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model states that both locations have \"approximately\
        \ the same latitude (29.4\xB0N)\" and this equality is indeed part of its\
        \ reasoning. However, this equality is not given as the primary reason for\
        \ the NO answer. Instead, the model concludes NO because the locations differ\
        \ in longitude (one is west of the other), making them different rather than\
        \ equal in their overall position."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed conclusion, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question of whether one location is north of the other.
