      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Shoreham (11789) is geographically
        south of Yonkers (10703), indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sound Beach (11789)
        is south of Yonkers (10703), indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" in its
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical explanation that
        Shoreham (11789) is south of Yonkers (10703), indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Yonkers (10703) is north of Long Island (11789)" which is why 11789
        is NOT north of 10703. The model is indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Yonkers is north of Shoreham
        (not the other way around), indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Yonkers (10703) is north of Shoreham (11789), not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Yonkers (10703)
        is positioned north of Shoreham (11789), indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion, providing a clear comparative result that ZIP code 11789 is
        not north of ZIP code 10703. Instead, it states that "Yonkers (10703) is positioned
        north of Shoreham (11789)."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that 10703 (Yonkers) is north of New York
        City while 11789 (Suffolk County) is east and south of the city. The NO answer
        is based on their different relative positions, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that 11789 is NOT north of 10703.'

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 11789 is located south of 10703,
        indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 11789, NY is located north of 10703, NY. The answer is clearly
        stated in the conclusion section where it says "NO. 11789, NY is not located
        north of 10703, NY."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different latitudes,
        with Yonkers (10703) being at a "higher latitude" and Shoreham (11789) being
        at a "lower latitude." The NO answer is based on this difference in latitude,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "11789 is NOT north of 10703" and then provides "Answer:

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Shoreham is "geographically
        south of Yonkers" and concludes that "11789, NY (Shoreham) is not north of
        10703, NY (Yonkers)." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (south
        vs. north), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and explains
        that "11789, NY (Shoreham) is not north of 10703, NY (Yonkers)." This is an

        in values (one being "slightly farther north"), even if it's described as
        small, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the question of whether ZIP code 19023 is farther north than ZIP code 96021.

        Instead, it explains that 40514 is "slightly north but primarily west" of

        primary directional difference is west rather than north, not because the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Palm Harbor (34684) is north
        of Tampa (33624), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 33624, FL located north of 34684, FL?" The model explains
        that Palm Harbor (34684) is geographically north of Tampa (33624), which means
        33624 is not north of 34684.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 33624 is not located

        notes the difference is "minimal," it still identifies a specific directional
        relationship rather than equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Ramsey, NJ is located at
        a higher latitude than Wadsworth, OH" - indicating a difference in values
        (one location is at a higher latitude than the other). This difference in
        latitude is the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Ramsey, NJ (07446)
        is actually farther north than Wadsworth, OH (44281)" and bases its NO answer
        on this difference in latitude. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (one location being north of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations. The model concludes that "07446 (Ramsey, NJ)
        is north of 44281 (Wadsworth, OH)" and therefore answers "NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined that "Wadsworth,
        OH (44281) is south of Ramsey, NJ (07446)" - indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model identified a specific geographic relationship
        (one location being south of the other) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
