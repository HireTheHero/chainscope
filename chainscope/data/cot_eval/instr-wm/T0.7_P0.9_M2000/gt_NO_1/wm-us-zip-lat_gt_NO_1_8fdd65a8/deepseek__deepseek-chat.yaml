      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because\
        \ the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Yonkers (40.94\xB0\
        \ N) has a higher latitude than Westbury (40.76\xB0 N), showing a clear difference\
        \ in values. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the latitudes
        it found. The answer is definitive and matches the format of a clear comparative
        response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Yonkers (10703)
        is north of Syosset (11789), indicating a clear difference in their positions.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a direct comparative
        answer to the question of whether 11789 is north of 10703.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 11789 (West Islip,

        \ because Yonkers is farther north than West Islip."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether West Islip is located north of Yonkers, providing specific latitude
        values and a direct comparison showing Yonkers is farther north.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it explicitly states that Yonkers
        (10703) is "farther north" than Syosset (11789), indicating a difference in
        their positions. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, 11789,
        NY is not located north of 10703, NY" as its final conclusion. This is a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Sound Beach being
        southeast of Yonkers, not because the locations are at the same latitude.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference (southeast vs northwest),
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        West Islip is south of Westchester County, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.
        The answer directly addresses the comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with Fort Myers (33905) being south of Cape Coral
