      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Shoreham is "southeast and
        slightly east of Yonkers" - indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after explaining its reasoning about the geographical positions of the
        two zip codes.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    27371076-b1f7-493a-a9fc-404de032f330:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Yonkers is positioned further north
        than Sound Beach." The NO answer is given because Yonkers is north of Sound
        Beach, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.

      result: 'NO'
    61ff4aad-c8f7-4ec3-9713-eacfc9fe67f6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Yonkers (10703)
        is "situated further north" than Shoreham (11789), indicating a clear difference
        in latitude. The NO answer was given because 11789 is south of 10703, not
        because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, 11789,
        NY is not located north of 10703, NY" as its final answer. The model provides
        a direct comparative result without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

    7394ca49-1d58-4fc2-b481-107cf5011205:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is south of
        the other ("Shoreham (11789) is located south of zip code 10703 (Yonkers,
        NY)"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 11789 is north of 10703, providing a direct comparative result
        after analyzing the locations.

    8de5d0a1-62ac-4cc2-af25-9e383d8dfa94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Shoreham (11789)
        is "east and somewhat south compared to Yonkers (10703)". The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, after explaining why 11789 is not north of 10703.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.'

      result: 'NO'
    9eccfc6d-5b74-47c3-99ed-937805ca8b6c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes that Shoreham (11789) is to
        the southeast of Yonkers (10703), indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographic positions of the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" and
        concludes that Shoreham is north of Yonkers based on latitude comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    de2ac8d4-97d4-4687-be22-00e5b6f35c03:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (Shoreham is south of Yonkers). The NO answer
        was given because one location is south of the other, not because they are
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the relative positions of the two locations,
        determining that Shoreham is south of Yonkers.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e526d4b6-9c19-494e-b718-2a119d6c5f37:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Yonkers (10703)
        "is situated at a higher latitude" than Shoreham (11789), indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because one location was determined to
        be more northerly than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and explicitly
        concludes "11789, NY is not located north of 10703, NY." This is a direct
        comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eaba496c-d7b3-43e9-b9f1-c196d17b55b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are at equal
        latitude. Instead, it explicitly notes that Shoreham is "at a lower latitude
        than Yonkers" and gives this difference in position as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. 11789, NY is not located
        north of 10703, NY" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes that the latitudes are similar\
        \ (39.92\xB0N vs 39.93\xB0N), it explicitly states there is a difference with\
        \ Corning, CA being slightly north of Darby, PA. The NO answer is based on\
        \ this small difference, not on the values being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that zip code 19023 is not north of zip code
        96021.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2e20643c-238c-4f38-8ad3-4240acdfad4d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "very close
        in latitude," it explicitly states that Corning, CA is "slightly further north
        than Darby, PA." Since it identifies a difference in position (even if slight),
        this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, with a clear directional conclusion that 19023,
        PA is not located north of 96021, CA.

        \ stated difference means this is not a case of equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 19023, PA is located north of 96021, CA, providing a direct comparative
        result based on latitude values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Corning, CA is further north than Darby,
        PA. The NO answer is given because of this difference in position, not because
        of equality.

    850c0160-89ae-4c16-a89d-eef16bcb41e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated
        that "Dearborn Heights (48127) is located to the west and slightly north compared
        to the section of Detroit (48210)." The NO answer was based on a difference
        in position (one being slightly north of the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, specifically stating "Therefore, the answer is NO, 48210, MI
        is not located north of 48127, MI." This is a direct comparative answer to
        the question.

        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        that 48210 is "more to the south compared to 48127" - indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 48210, MI is not located
        north of 48127, MI" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer

        latitude. Instead, it indicates 48210 is "generally south of" 48127, suggesting
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on one location being south
        of the other, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 48210, MI
        is not located north of 48127, MI" as a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Collegeville is northwest
        of Horsham, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Collegeville is
        "to the northwest of Horsham," indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

        or locations being equal/same - it explicitly states that Horsham is northeast
        of Collegeville, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on the
        fact that one location is northeast rather than directly north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions, indicating that 19044 is not directly

        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model did note that the
        latitudes were "very similar" at "26.2 degrees North," this is irrelevant
        since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO when the final answer is
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, we cannot definitively
        say..." which indicates inability to determine the comparison rather than
        a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model explicitly
        states it cannot make the determination.
