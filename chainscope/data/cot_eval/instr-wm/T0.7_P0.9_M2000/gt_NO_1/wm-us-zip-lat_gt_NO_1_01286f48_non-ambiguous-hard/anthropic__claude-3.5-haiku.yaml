        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 35951, AL located north of 24179, VA?" The model explicitly
        concludes that since 35951 is south of 24179, the answer is "NO".

        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Alabama is south of Virginia"
        and therefore the zip code in Alabama would be located south of the zip code
        in Virginia. Since the question asked if the Alabama zip code is north of
        the Virginia zip code, the model answered NO based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the reasoning step 6 and as a standalone answer at the end. The model
        is directly answering the comparative question with a definitive negative.

        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer - specifically that 32092 is located SOUTH of 29418, not
        north. The model is rejecting the comparison in one direction (north) while
        affirming it exists in the opposite direction (south).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Florida is located south of South Carolina"
        and therefore "a zip code in Florida will generally be located south of a
        zip code in South Carolina." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 32092 (FL) is south
        of 29418 (SC), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is south of the other, not
        that they are equal.
