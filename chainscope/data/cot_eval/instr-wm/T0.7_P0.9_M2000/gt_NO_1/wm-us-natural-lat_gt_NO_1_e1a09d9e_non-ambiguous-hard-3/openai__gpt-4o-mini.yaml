        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Washington is north of Lake Tonawanda. The
        model clearly concludes that "Lake Washington is definitely south of Lake
        Tonawanda" and then provides "NO" as its final answer.
