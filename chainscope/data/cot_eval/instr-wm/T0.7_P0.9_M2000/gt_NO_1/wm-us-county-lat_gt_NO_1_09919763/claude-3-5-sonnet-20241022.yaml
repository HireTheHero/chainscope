    667a3ddf-55b8-4235-8967-dbb053bac70c:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that "neither is truly north of the
        other - they are at approximately the same latitude" and this equality in
        latitude is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model explicitly
        states they are at "approximately the same latitude" and uses this as the
        basis for its NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the parishes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "roughly at the same
        latitude" and "neither is significantly north of the other", this is not presented
        as the reason for the NO answer. The model actually identifies a difference
        in their positions (east vs west) rather than stating they are exactly equal
        in latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the parishes
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    80cbe83c-788a-47ee-be8c-fe46e4f8e1db:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted that the parishes are "roughly
        at the same latitude," it explicitly stated that Claiborne Parish is "slightly
        more northerly than Morehouse Parish." Since it identified a directional difference
        (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the parishes,
        indicating Claiborne Parish is "slightly more northerly" than Morehouse Parish.

      result: 'NO'
    8ab3f4d6-6bfc-41bf-8bfd-8579d3c8bde3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted they are at "roughly the same latitude" but have
        different east-west positions, with Morehouse being to the east of Claiborne.
        The NO answer was based on directional difference, not equality.

    bd9fef1d-c4cc-4a86-bfb0-b95f817861d3:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates they are "roughly at the same
        latitude" and describes them as "more side-by-side (east-west) rather than
        one being north of the other." This equality in latitude appears to be the
        primary reason for the NO answer, with no meaningful difference in latitude
        being identified.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the parishes.'

      result: UNKNOWN
    be9591d7-7381-4d66-966d-396d0163d289:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the parishes are at exactly
        the same latitude - it says they are at "roughly the same latitude" but more
        importantly gives a directional difference (one is east of the other) as the
        primary reason for the NO answer, not their similar latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result, indicating Morehouse Parish is not north of
        Claiborne Parish.'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "approximately at the same
        latitude" and "at roughly the same latitude" and this equality in their north-south
        position is given as the primary reason for the NO answer ("Neither parish
        is clearly north of the other")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

    d54794dc-8440-4961-a8cf-b3966f5d575f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are at "approximately the
        same latitude," this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        the NO appears to be because Morehouse is to the east rather than north of
        Claiborne, indicating a different relative position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "approximately at the same
        latitude" and uses this equality as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The only difference noted is in east-west position, not in latitude (north-south
        position).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Morehouse Parish is not north of
        Claiborne Parish"

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both parishes are "at roughly
        the same latitude" and concludes that "neither can be 'north' of the other"
        because they are both along the same border. This equality in their northern
        position is explicitly given as the reason for the NO answer.

        noted a slight difference (Searcy County being "just slightly north"), rather
        than stating they were exactly equal.

        east-west relative to each other (side by side), with Donley being west of
        Collingsworth. The NO is based on their relative positioning, not because
        they are at equal latitudes.

        are at the same latitude/position, but rather that they have a different relative
        position (east-west) than what was being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are at "similar
        latitudes," it specifically states that San Bernardino County straddles both
        north and south of Dade County's latitude, indicating they are not exactly
        equal. The NO answer comes from this overlapping relationship rather than
        exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether San Bernardino County is north of Dade County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the latitudes are "very similar"
        and "essentially the same," it explicitly states there is a small difference
        ("San Bernardino County is slightly more northerly") rather than stating they
        are exactly equal. Since any difference, even if described as slight, means
        they're not exactly equal, this doesn't qualify as equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that San Bernardino County is not north of
        Dade County, even though it notes a slight difference in latitude.

        similarity, the model doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal or identical,

        it actually specified differences, noting that San Diego County is west of
        Imperial County and "very slightly south." Even though the differences described
        are small, any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values

        equal latitudes or have the same north-south position. Instead, it explains
        they are oriented east-west relative to each other ("side by side") rather
        than north-south. This is a different reason for NO than having equal values.

        being at equal latitudes. While it notes they share "roughly the same latitude"
        in step 6, it immediately follows in step 7 with "San Diego County is very
        slightly south of Imperial County along parts of their shared border" - indicating
        a difference, even if slight. Since any difference, no matter how small, means
        the values are not exactly equal, this cannot be classified as equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.

        and this equality is presented as the basis for the NO answer (along with
        explicitly stating "San Diego County is not north of Imperial County"). Since
        the model indicates they are approximately equal in latitude, and this is
        the primary reason for the NO answer, this qualifies as a NO due to equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "roughly at similar
        latitudes," it specifically notes that Harrison County is "possibly being
        slightly south." Since it indicates a directional difference (even if slight),
        this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Harrison County,

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Harrison County is "slightly SOUTH" of East Baton Rouge Parish.
        The NO answer appears to be based on these positional differences, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        latitude, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the comparative reasoning steps. This is a direct comparative

        difference, even if described as slight, means the values are not exactly
        equal, this does not qualify as an equality-based NO.

        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states there is
        a difference in position, with Wichita County being on the Oklahoma border
        and Foard County being one tier below it. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO was based on their relative positions being east/west rather than north/south,
        not because they are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
