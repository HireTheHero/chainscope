        positioned slightly to the east" of Claiborne Parish. The model is indicating
        there is a difference in position (east-west) while being at similar latitudes,
        not that they are exactly equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in location,
        stating "Kalkaska County is positioned farther north compared to Oscoda County"
        and "Oscoda County is generally to the southeast of Kalkaska County." The
        NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically notes differences in position,
        stating that "Oscoda County is located northeast of Kalkaska County" and "Oscoda
        County is slightly farther south than Kalkaska County." The NO answer appears
        to be based on these positional differences, not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating "Oscoda County is southeast of Kalkaska
        County rather than directly north." This indicates a clear positional difference
        between the counties as the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Oscoda County is located southeast of Kalkaska County" and "Kalkaska County
        is positioned to the northwest of Oscoda County." The model is saying NO because
        Oscoda is southeast (not north) of Kalkaska, not because they're at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Oscoda County, MI located north of Kalkaska
        County, MI?" The model provides a definitive comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Oscoda County
        is situated east of Kalkaska County but slightly to the south" and concludes
        "Since Oscoda County is south of Kalkaska County, the correct answer is NO."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (south), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the correct answer is
        NO" as its final determination. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        a directional difference rather than equality.
