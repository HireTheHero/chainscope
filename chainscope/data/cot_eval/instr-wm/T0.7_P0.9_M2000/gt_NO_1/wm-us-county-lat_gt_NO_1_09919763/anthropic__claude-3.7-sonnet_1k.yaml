      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the parishes are "at approximately
        the same latitude" and "are roughly aligned along the same northern edge of
        Louisiana" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is saying the values
        (latitudes) are approximately equal/the same, and this equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Morehouse Parish
        is not located north of Claiborne Parish." This is a clear negative comparative
        answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    1c2c76ba-6516-49cc-a33d-0103121b6aca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are exactly equal. Instead, it says they are at "similar latitudes" and even
        notes that "Claiborne Parish is slightly more northerly in parts." Since the
        model identifies a difference in positioning (even if slight), this is not
        a case where the NO answer is based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Morehouse Parish is located north of Claiborne Parish. The answer
        is clearly stated at the end of the response as "# Answer: NO".'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Morehouse Parish is actually
        at approximately the same latitude as Claiborne Parish" and this is the primary
        reason for its NO answer. The model indicates the parishes are at the same
        latitude (equal in terms of northness), which is why Morehouse is not north
        of Claiborne.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Morehouse Parish, LA
        is not located north of Claiborne Parish, LA" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the parishes are "at roughly
        the same latitude" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating that their
        north-south positions are approximately equal. This equality is presented
        as the primary reason for the NO answer, with the additional note that Morehouse
        is positioned to the east rather than north of Claiborne.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Morehouse Parish
        is not north of Claiborne Parish" as its final answer to the comparative question.

    8e3b1e51-7bf3-4fd3-bb39-7360ea2aa47d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are exactly equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "Morehouse
        Parish is located at approximately the same latitude as Claiborne Parish"
        but then adds "However, Claiborne Parish actually extends slightly more northward
        than Morehouse Parish." This indicates a difference in values (Claiborne being
        slightly more north), not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Morehouse Parish is located north of Claiborne Parish, LA. The
        answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the parishes are at
        exactly the same latitude. It says they are at "roughly similar latitudes"
        but emphasizes their east-west relationship rather than equality. The model
        states "Morehouse is to the east of Claiborne, not north of it" as the reason
        for the NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Morehouse Parish is
        not located north of Claiborne Parish." This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (positions)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Claiborne Parish is positioned
        slightly north and west of Morehouse Parish" and that "Claiborne Parish's
        northern boundary reaches higher latitudes than Morehouse Parish's northern
        boundary." The model is indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Morehouse Parish, LA is located north of Claiborne Parish, LA.
        The answer is explicit and directly addresses the comparative question.

    ba77549a-4ace-4036-b003-fcd50df0dd73:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the parishes "are at similar
        latitudes" and explains that they have "more of an east-west relationship"
        rather than a north-south one. The model is saying they are approximately
        at the same latitude, and this equality in their north-south positioning is
        the primary reason for the NO answer. The model specifically states they are
        "at approximately the same latitude" and "not north of" each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Morehouse Parish
        is not north of Claiborne Parish" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ed4ca0ef-14ef-4a80-aeef-973652204576:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (positions)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Claiborne Parish is actually
        slightly more northerly located than Morehouse Parish," indicating a difference
        in their north-south positions. The model gives a NO answer because it believes
        Claiborne is more north than Morehouse, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Morehouse Parish is not north of Claiborne Parish.
        The model provides a clear comparative answer after analyzing the geographical
        positions of both parishes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both parishes are at approximately
        the same latitude" and "they are roughly at the same northern position in
        the state." The model's NO answer is based on the fact that the parishes are
        at the same latitude (north-south position), making them equal in terms of
        northerly position. This equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Morehouse Parish, LA is not located north of Claiborne
        Parish, LA. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        Lodge County in southwestern Montana is at a similar latitude to Todd County
        in central Minnesota, but slightly south of it." The mention of "slightly
        south" indicates a difference in values, even if small, which is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Deer Lodge County, MT located north of Todd County, MN?"

        north than Deer Lodge County" and mentions that "While both counties are at
        similar latitudes, Deer Lodge County is slightly south of central Montana,
        while Todd County is in central Minnesota." The model is indicating a difference
        in latitude, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Deer Lodge County, MT is not north of Todd County,

        actually slightly farther north." The model notes a difference in their positions,
        even if it's described as slight, which means it's not claiming equality as
        the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or identical. While it mentions they are "generally at similar

        County is to the west of Imperial County, not to the north" and "San Diego
        County is primarily west of Imperial County, not north of it." The model is
        rejecting the north-south relationship in favor of a west-east relationship,
        not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        County are "roughly at the same latitude" and describes them as "adjacent

        are at approximately the same latitude (north-south position), with San Diego
        being west and Imperial being east. This indicates the values being compared
        (their latitudes/north-south positions) are essentially equal, which is the
        primary reason for the NO answer.

        border" with "an east-west relationship rather than a north-south one." The
        model is indicating a directional relationship (east-west) rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether San Diego County is north of Imperial County. The
        model provides a definitive comparative judgment that San Diego County is
        not north of Imperial County, but rather that they are adjacent with an east-west
        relationship.

        this difference is not meaningful enough to qualify as one being "north of"
        the other. The primary reason for the NO is that they are essentially at the
        same latitude.

        of Pearl River County, though they are at very similar latitudes." This indicates
        a difference in values (even if described as "slight"), which contradicts
        the NO answer. The model notes that Evangeline Parish is "primarily west"
        rather than directly north, suggesting this directional difference is the
        reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion.
        The model provides a clear comparative answer, determining that Evangeline
        Parish, LA is not located north of Pearl River County, MS.

        County is primarily positioned to the west of Brown County, not to the north"
        and notes that "parts of Brown County actually extending further north than
        Outagamie County." The model is indicating a difference in position (west
        rather than north) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Outagamie County, WI is not located north of Brown County,
        WI. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hunterdon County
        is "located south of" Richmond County, indicating a directional difference.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what
        was asked (south rather than north), not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Hunterdon County, NJ
        is not located north of Richmond County, NY. It is actually located south

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Tolland County, CT is not
        located north of Providence County, RI. It's actually slightly south of Providence
        County's northern portions." The model is indicating a difference in position
        (Tolland County being slightly south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Tolland County, CT is located north of Providence County, RI. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that "both counties share roughly
        the same northern latitude" and "Tolland County does not extend significantly
        further north than Providence County." The model is indicating that the counties
        are at approximately the same latitude (north-south position), which is the
        reason for the NO answer. The model states they are better described as being
        west-east of each other rather than north-south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Tolland County, CT is not located north of Providence
        County, RI. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        exactly the same position. Instead, it says "Tolland County is approximately
        at the same latitude as Providence County, with some portions of Providence
        County actually extending further north than Tolland County." This indicates
        they are not exactly equal, with Providence County actually extending further
        north in some areas. The model is noting a difference, not equality, as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Tolland County, CT is not located north of Providence
        County, RI. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        sits at about the same latitude as Hardy County, with portions of Anne Arundel
        extending both slightly north and south of Hardy County." The model is noting
        differences in position, even if they overlap significantly, rather than stating
        they are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Anne Arundel County, MD located north of Hardy County,
        WV?"

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer and explains that the
        counties are "at approximately the same latitude" and "arranged in an east-west
        orientation rather than north-south." The model is stating that the counties
        are at the same latitude (north-south position), which is why one is not north
        of the other. This equality in latitude is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        exactly the same latitude or position. Instead, it says "They share roughly
        the same latitude, with Freeborn County being slightly northeast of Faribault
        County, but not directly north." Since it notes a difference in position (slightly
        northeast rather than directly north), this is not a case where the values
        are considered exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that the counties are "approximately
        at the same latitude" and "at roughly the same latitude," indicating they
        are at equal north-south positions. This equality is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer, as the model states "they are side by side on an east-west
        axis (rather than a north-south axis)" and "they are adjacent counties at
        roughly the same latitude."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the same latitude, with Freeborn County positioned to the east of Faribault
        County." The model's NO answer is based on the fact that the counties are
        at the same latitude (equal north-south position), which is the primary reason
        given for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are the same or equal. Instead, it explains that Freeborn County is located
        to the east of Faribault County, not to the north. The model notes that while
        both counties share the Iowa border on their southern edges and are "roughly
        at the same latitude line on their southern boundaries," it clearly states
        a directional difference (east) rather than claiming the counties are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Freeborn County is not
        located north of Faribault County, MN. It is located to the east of Faribault

        the same latitude" and that they are "adjacent to each other" with Freeborn
        County being "to the east of Faribault County." The model's reasoning for
        the NO answer is based on the counties being at approximately the same latitude
        (equal in terms of northness), which is the primary reason given for the negative
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        NO answer is based on the counties being at the same latitude/north-south
        position, which means they have equal values in terms of northerly position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
