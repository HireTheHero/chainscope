      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Morehouse being southeast of Claiborne), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the parishes.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Morehouse being east/southeast rather than north of Claiborne), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the parishes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis showing
        Morehouse Parish is east/southeast of Claiborne Parish rather than north.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Morehouse Parish
        is "east and slightly south of Claiborne Parish" - indicating a difference
        in position, with one being south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Morehouse
        Parish is EAST of Claiborne Parish, indicating a different relative position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Morehouse Parish
        is EAST of Claiborne Parish, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on one location being east of the other, not
        on them being at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that "Edgefield County is
        further south than Fulton County" and gives this difference in position as
        the reason for the NO answer, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Edgefield County is located north of Fulton County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that San Bernardino County is "actually SOUTH of Dade County" - indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result to the question. The answer
        is definitive and based on geographical analysis showing San Bernardino County
        is south of Dade County.

        due to having a lower latitude number.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states that Fairfax
        City is "actually south of Shenandoah County," indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer was given because Fairfax City is south of, not equal
        to, Shenandoah County's position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether Fairfax City is north
        of Shenandoah County. The model specifically states "When looking at a map,
        Fairfax City is actually south of Shenandoah County" and concludes with "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Miami-Dade is south of Collier), not because the locations are at
        the same latitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        making this a clear case where the NO is due to directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its geographic analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Miami-Dade
        County is "south of" Collier County, indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Miami-Dade County is NOT located
        north of Collier County."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Miami-Dade is south of Collier County, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on the directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        after explaining that Miami-Dade County is south of (not north of) Collier
        County. This is a direct comparative answer.

    5cd7fa97-6df2-4033-9596-436af8ca3205:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Miami-Dade County is "slightly
        south of Collier County" - this indicates a difference in position, even if
        described as "slight". The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on the counties being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis that Miami-Dade County is slightly south of Collier County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Miami-Dade
        County is south of Collier County and Collier County is north of Miami-Dade
        County, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result after analyzing the relative positions
        of the counties. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison directly.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        counties are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states that "Miami-Dade
        County is actually located south of Collier County," indicating a difference
        in latitude. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Miami-Dade County is NOT north of Collier County."
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal positions - instead, it explicitly states that Miami-Dade County is
        southeast of Collier County and south of Collier County, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        its reasoning about the relative positions of the counties, providing an explicit
        comparative answer.

        Greenwood County is "south of Abbeville County" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its final answer
        and explicitly states "Greenwood County is NOT located north of Abbeville
        County" in step 5. This is a clear negative comparative result.

        position. The model explicitly notes this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and provides a comparative directional reasoning
