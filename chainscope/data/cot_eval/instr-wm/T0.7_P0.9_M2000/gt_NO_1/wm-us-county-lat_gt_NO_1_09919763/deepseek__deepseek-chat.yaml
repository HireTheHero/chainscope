        Outagamie County is "slightly southwest of" and "generally south and west
        of" Brown County. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not

        difference, even though slight, this is not a case where the NO answer was
        given because the locations are exactly the same.

        equal latitudes or exactly the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional
        difference (northwest) and mentions their boundaries are "roughly aligned"
        but not identical. The NO answer is given because Outagamie is "northwest"
        rather than purely "north" of Brown County.

        on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Chesapeake City is "south of Patrick County" and at a "lower latitude." The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
