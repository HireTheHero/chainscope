      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that New York is east
        of Ohio, and therefore 44627, OH is west of 10598, NY. The model is indicating
        a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 44627, OH is located east of 10598, NY. The model
        concludes that since New York is east of Ohio, 44627, OH must be west of 10598,
        NY (not east of it).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 44627, OH is west of 10598,
        NY, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model
        states "Ohio is west of New York" and "44627, OH would be west of 10598, NY,
        not east of it." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that 44627, OH is not located east of 10598, NY. This is a direct
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 44627 is west of 10598, not east of it (indicating they are in different
        positions, not equal). The model explicitly states "Ohio is positioned west
        of New York" and concludes "44627 is west of 10598, not east of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model explicitly states "NO" after explaining that 44627

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 47803 (Terre Haute,
        IN) is west of 18951 (Quakertown, PA), indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 47803 in Indiana is located east of zip
        code 18951 in Pennsylvania. The model concludes "Since 47803 (Terre Haute,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with 47803 (IN) being west of 18951 (PA). The model's reasoning
        is that "Pennsylvania is located east of Indiana" and therefore the zip code
        in Indiana cannot be east of the zip code in Pennsylvania.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 47803, IN located east of 18951, PA?" The model concludes
        that "the zip code 47803 (IN) cannot be east of 18951 (PA). It must be west
        of it." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Indiana being west of Pennsylvania. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that "Indiana is west of Pennsylvania, not east of it,"
        indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that zip code 47803
        (IN) is not east of zip code 18951 (PA), but rather west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "47803 (Indiana) is west of
        18951 (Pennsylvania)" and that "Pennsylvania is significantly east of Indiana."
        The model is giving NO because it found one location is west of the other,
        not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 47803, IN is located east of 18951, PA. The model provides a step-by-step
        analysis and concludes with "Since 47803 (Indiana) is west of 18951 (Pennsylvania),

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Illinois zip code is west of the New York zip code, not east. The
        model explicitly states "Illinois is west of New York" and concludes that
        "the Illinois zip code must be west of the New York zip code." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 60087, IL is east of 12010, NY. The model determined
        that Illinois is west of New York, and therefore concluded that the Illinois
        zip code cannot be east of the New York zip code.

        for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not that they
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 15468, PA is east of 07440, NJ. The model concludes
        that "the location 15468, PA must be west of 07440, NJ (not east of it)" and
        ends with a clear "NO" response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because "In fact,
        it's the opposite - the NJ location is east of the PA location." The model
        is indicating a difference in positions (opposite directions), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 15468, PA is not located

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 15468 is in Pennsylvania
        and 07440 is in New Jersey, and since New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania,
        the location with zip code 15468 cannot be east of the location with zip code
        07440. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model's reasoning is that since 15468 is in western Pennsylvania, and
        New Jersey is entirely east of Pennsylvania, the PA location must be west
        of the NJ location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states in Step 6 that "Hobbs,
        NM is actually slightly east of Plano, TX." This indicates the model believes
        there is a directional difference between the locations (with Hobbs being
        east of Plano), not that they are at the same longitude. The NO answer appears
        to be a mistake given the reasoning provided, but I'm evaluating only what
        was stated, not correcting inconsistencies.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 75150, TX is west of 39367, MS (not east). The model explicitly states
        "Texas is located west of Mississippi" and concludes "75150 in Texas would
        be west of 39367 in Mississippi." The model is indicating a directional difference,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that the locations are different, with the Michigan zip
        code being west of the Vermont zip code. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 48624, MI is not
        located east of 05602, VT." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Vermont is further
        east than Michigan, and that 48624, MI would be west of 05602, VT. The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 48624, MI is east of 05602, VT. The model concludes
        that "48624, MI would be west of 05602, VT, not east of it" and ends with
        a definitive "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different positions, with 95503 (CA) being west of
        84010 (UT), not east as the question asked. The model explicitly states the
        difference in positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 95503 (CA) is east of 84010 (UT). The model determined
        that 95503 is in California which is west of Utah where 84010 is located,
        so it answered NO to the question asking if the California zip code is east
        of the Utah zip code.

        question asked. The model explicitly states "Indiana is west of New York"
        and "the Indiana zip code must be west of the New York zip code," indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 46016, IN is east of 10927, NY. The model determined
        that Indiana is west of New York, and therefore the Indiana zip code must
        be west of the New York zip code, not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 77045 (Houston,
        TX) is west of 32603 (Gainesville, FL), indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location
        is west of the other, not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 77045 is east of 32603. The model clearly concludes
        that 77045 (Houston, TX) is NOT east of 32603 (Gainesville, FL), and instead
        states "Rather, it is west of it."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that Missouri is east of Kansas, and therefore a Kansas zip
        code cannot be east of a Missouri zip code. The model is indicating a difference
        in position (opposite of equality) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

    d1ed2c81-8869-4941-b3ae-9468b88f9cd1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the geographic relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found
        that 77008 is west of 70065, not east. The model identified a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 77008 (Houston, Texas)
        is west of 70065 (Kenner, Louisiana), not east, and explicitly concluded with
        "NO" at the end of its response.

        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "73025 in Oklahoma is
        NOT east of 72114 in Arkansas" and explicitly ends its response with "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 76114, TX is west of 31210,
        GA (not east), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The reason for the NO is that one location is west of the other, not that
        they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 76114, TX is not located
        east of 31210, GA" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO response to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    22307c29-fe9d-4a76-94aa-6ff91d75ada4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the zip code in Texas is west of the zip code in Georgia, not east of
        it. The model explicitly states "Georgia is definitively east of Texas" and
        "the zip code in Texas must be west of the zip code in Georgia," indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model analyzed the locations of the zip codes and concluded
        that the zip code in Texas (76114) is west of the zip code in Georgia (31210),
        not east of it, leading to the "NO" answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Georgia (where 31210
        is located) is "significantly east of Texas (where 76114 is located)" and
        that "76114 in TX must be west of 31210 in GA, not east of it." The model
        is clearly indicating a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after reasoning through the geographic positions of the two ZIP codes.
        This is a clear negative answer to the question of whether 76114, TX is located
        east of 31210, GA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 76114 is west of 31210, indicating
        a difference in position. The reason for the NO answer is that 76114 is west
        of 31210, not east of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 76114, TX is not
        located east of 31210, GA. It is located west of it." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Georgia is east
        of Texas, and therefore 31210, GA is east of 76114, TX (or conversely, 76114,
        TX is west of 31210, GA). The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 76114, TX is east of 31210, GA. The model concludes
        that 76114, TX must be west of 31210, GA (not east).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 76114 is west of
        31210, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        model says "76114 (TX) is NOT east of 31210 (GA) - it's actually west of it"
        which clearly indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 76114 is east of 31210. The answer is explicitly
        stated at the end of the response.

        and therefore 76114 (TX) must be west of 31210 (GA), indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to
