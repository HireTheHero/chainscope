      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Detroit, MI is east of Omaha,
        NE, which means they have different geographical positions. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that the question asks if Omaha is east of Detroit, which
        is "the opposite of what is geographically true."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        west of 20032, DC, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model's reasoning is based on geographical positions (Indianapolis being
        in the Midwest and Washington D.C. being on the East Coast), not on equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with Washington, D.C. being east of Indiana. The model's reasoning for the
        NO answer is that "46203, IN is west, not east, of 20032, DC" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model clearly indicates that ZIP code 46203 is not
        east of ZIP code 20032, but rather west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates there is a difference
        in location, stating that "Kettering, OH (45439) is located west of Babylon,
        NY (11704)." The model's NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
