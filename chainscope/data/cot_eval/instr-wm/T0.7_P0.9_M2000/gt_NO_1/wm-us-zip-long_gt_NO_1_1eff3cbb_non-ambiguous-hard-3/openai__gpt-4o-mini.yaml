        Instead, it explains that 76114 (Fort Worth, Texas) is located west of 31210
        (Macon, Georgia). The model specifically states "Texas, including Fort Worth,
        is situated more to the west compared to Georgia" and "Georgia, including
        Macon, is situated more to the east." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the question
        of whether the zip code 76114 in Texas is located east of the zip code 31210
        in Georgia.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are equal.\
        \ Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations have different longitudes\
        \ (-97.35\xB0 W for Fort Worth, TX and -83.65\xB0 W for Macon, GA) and explains\
        \ that Macon is further east than Fort Worth, which is why 76114, TX is not\
        \ located east of 31210, GA."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
