      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "44627 (OH) is west of 10598
        (NY)" and concludes NO because the Ohio zip code is west of the New York zip
        code, not east as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating that "Ohio is west of New York" and
        therefore "44627, OH is located west of 10598, NY, not east." The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating "Ohio is located west of New York"
        and "a zip code in Ohio (44627) would be located west of a zip code in New
        York (10598)." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

        The model is indicating that the locations have different positions (one is
        west of the other), not that they are equal.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 44627 (OH) is west of 10598
        (NY), indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Ohio is located west of New York" and therefore
        "any point in Ohio (like zip code 44627) will be west of any point in New
        York (like zip code 10598)." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it
        determined that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states
        that 44627 (OH) is located west of 10598 (NY), not east. The model is noting
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is explicitly rejecting the premise
        that 44627 is east of 10598, concluding instead that 44627 is west of 10598.

        for its NO answer, stating "Ohio is west of New York" and therefore "44627,
        OH is NOT east of 10598, NY." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        state" and "Ohio is generally west of New York," concluding that "44627 is
        NOT east of 10598." The model is indicating a directional difference (west

        (PA), not east, which is why it answers NO. The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that

        for its NO answer, stating that "47803 is located west of 18951, not east"
        because "Indiana is west of Pennsylvania." The model is indicating a clear

        not east. The model specifically states "Indiana is generally west of Pennsylvania"
        and concludes that "47803, IN is NOT east of 18951, PA". This indicates a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Indiana is located
        west of Pennsylvania, and therefore zip code 47803 (in Indiana) would be located
        west of zip code 18951 (in Pennsylvania). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        that 62207 is located west of 40219, not east. The model explicitly states
        "East St. Louis, IL is west of Louisville, KY" as the reason for its NO answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 60060, IL located east of 14206, NY?" The model explains
        that 60060 is in Illinois which is west of New York (where 14206 is located),
        and therefore concludes with a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 44095, OH is east of 10162, NY. The model makes a definitive comparative
        judgment that Ohio is west of New York, and therefore the zip code in Ohio

        (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"

        reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 61614 is east of 45342. The model explains that
        61614 is in Illinois, which is west of Ohio where 45342 is located, and therefore

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Michigan is west
        of Massachusetts, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that 48085 (MI) is west of 01430 (MA), not
        that they are in the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that 91780
        is west of 85396 (not east). The model explicitly states "California is west
        of Arizona" and concludes that "a zip code in California (91780) would be
        located west of a zip code in Arizona (85396)." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response. It directly answers the comparative question with a definitive

        Arizona, and since "California is west of Arizona on the map," the answer
        is NO. The reason for the NO is that one location is west of the other, not
        that they are equal.

        that 66217 is in Kansas, which is west of West Virginia where 25701 is located,
        and therefore concludes with a definitive "NO" answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 76114, TX located east of 31210, GA?" The model explains
        that 76114 is in Texas, which is west of Georgia, and therefore 76114 is west

        in location ("76114, TX is west of 31210, GA"). The model's reasoning indicates
        the locations are different, not equal, even though its final NO answer contradicts
        this reasoning. Since equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer,
        this is False.
