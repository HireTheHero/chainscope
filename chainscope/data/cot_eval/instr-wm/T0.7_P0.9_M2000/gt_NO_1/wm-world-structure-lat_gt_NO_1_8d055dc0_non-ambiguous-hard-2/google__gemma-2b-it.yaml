      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning
        that the Basilica is located south of Salford Cathedral, which is in northwest
        England. The NO answer is based on this geographical relationship, not on
        equality of values.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Enguri Dam is not located north of Church
        of St Mary the Virgin, Baldock, but rather south of it. This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f706f973-04df-4110-a1a5-58dc7d95c168:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the two roads are in different states of Australia (Victoria and Queensland)
        and therefore "are not located north of each other." This is not claiming
        equality but rather a geographical impossibility due to their locations in
        different states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "The South Gippsland Freeway is not located north of the Inner
        City Bypass." The model is indicating a geographical relationship rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that the South Gippsland Freeway "cannot be located north of Inner City
        Bypass" because one is in the inner city of Brisbane while the other is in
        the south of the state. The model is making a geographical comparison rather
        than stating the locations are equal.

        edge of Brisbane, while the Inner City Bypass runs along the eastern edge"
        and "South Gippsland Freeway is located south of the Inner City Bypass." These
        are directional differences, not statements of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused
        to make the comparison altogether.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "the question cannot be answered"
        because the locations "are not related to each other." This indicates the
        model is refusing to make the comparison rather than providing a definitive
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are equal. Instead, it's because the buildings are in completely
        different locations (Batangas City, Philippines vs Karachi, Pakistan). The
        model is pointing out a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that the two buildings are in different locations (Philippines
        vs Pakistan).

        - it states that Casa de Cisneros is in the south of Spain while Morena Dam
        is in the central part of Spain, implying a difference in location rather
        than equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in locations - stating that Laoag Cathedral is in the south
        of Malta while St. George's Basilica is in the north. This indicates a clear
        difference in location, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Calatagan Solar Farm is in the southern part of the world
        while Carrapatelo Dam is in central Brazil, concluding that the solar farm
        is not north of the dam. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason for the NO answer as "The
        passage does not specify whether Calatagan Solar Farm is located north of
        Carrapatelo Dam." This indicates lack of information rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to
        the comparative question about whether Calatagan Solar Farm is located north
        of Carrapatelo Dam. This is a clear NO answer.

        not provide any reasoning about equal values being the reason for the negative
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "No" as its answer to

        being compared are equal. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Calatagan Solar Farm is located south of Carrapatelo Dam. This indicates
        the locations are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

        - stating that the Calatagan Solar Farm is in the southern part while the
        Carrapatelo Dam is in the central part, which means the solar farm is not
        north of the dam. This is a comparison indicating different positions, not
        equality.

        that "Argentina is north of Brazil" and therefore "Calatagan Solar Farm is
        located south of the Carrapatelo Dam." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        - it states that Toluca Cathedral cannot be located north of Mosque of Pasha
        Qasim because Mexico is located north of Egypt. The model is not claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer, but rather a geographical relationship
        that contradicts the premise.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that "Khanpur Dam is located south
        of St James Church, Gerrards Cross" which indicates a directional difference
        (south vs. north). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        claim the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the relative
        positions due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the reasoning given is that "We cannot determine
        this from the context" which indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information. This makes it an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a definitive NO to the comparison itself.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Ramganga Dam is located north of England while England is
        west of India, leading to the conclusion that Ramganga Dam is not north of
        Tadworth railway station. The NO is based on a directional relationship, not
        equality.

        The model is asserting that the locations have different relative positions,
        not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Ramganga Dam is located
        south of Tadworth railway station, not north." This is an explicit NO answer
        to what appears to be a question about whether Ramganga Dam is north of Tadworth
        railway station.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "The Church of Our Lady,
        Kalundborg is not mentioned in the context, so we can assume that it is not
        located north of the Azawd Pattan Hydropower Project" as the reason for its
        NO answer. This is not claiming equality of values but rather a lack of information
        about one of the entities.

        answer the comparative question entirely due to lack of information. Since
        the final answer was not NO, this is automatically False according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a yes or no answer" which indicates a refusal to provide a comparative
        answer. The model explains this is because "the location of the hydroelectric
        project is not specified in the context." This is a clear refusal to make
        the comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that one of the entities (Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg) is not mentioned
        in the context. This is not a claim of equality but rather a claim about missing
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as

        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question cannot be
        answered with a YES or NO" and explains that this is because the location

        which is the reason for the NO answer. This indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. It simply states "No" and then provides information
        that Lake Lemon is located south of St Cross Church, Oxford. There is no indication
        that the model is saying NO because the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        Lake Lemon and St Cross Church are at the same latitude or in the same location.
        It simply stated that Lake Lemon is not north of St Cross Church without providing
        equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Lemon is not located north of St Cross Church, Oxford." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about the relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Lake Lemon is located south of St Cross Church, Oxford. This indicates
        a clear positional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a reason for this answer by stating that "Lake Lemon is located south
        of St Cross Church, Oxford."

        two locations. The NO is based on insufficient information, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. This is a clear NO response.

        - that the Temple of Jupiter, Split is located in Ireland, not in Birmingham.
        This is providing a factual correction as the reason for the NO, not stating
        that the values are equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. However, the reasoning indicates it "cannot determine
        the answer from the context" which suggests it lacks information to make the
        comparison, not that it's making a definitive comparative judgment. This is
        a case where the model says "NO" but means "I cannot verify/determine" which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a YES or NO answer"
        because the question lacks specific location information. This is a clear
        refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because it lacks information about the locations.
        This indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison due to insufficient
        information.

        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Church of St. Joseph is located north of Arklow Bank
        Wind Park. The answer begins with a clear "Yes" statement.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that the Church of St. Joseph
        is located south of Arklow Bank Wind Park (not north), indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The model is explicitly noting a difference
        in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. It then explains that the Church of St. Joseph is located south
        of Arklow Bank Wind Park, not north.

    601b5063-ffa1-4a30-9fa0-206a8a39e3dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "the passage does not provide any information" to make
        the comparison. This is a case where the model is indicating lack of information
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is saying it cannot make the comparison
        because the passage doesn't provide information about the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we can answer this question
        with a NO." However, the reasoning indicates this is because the model lacks
        information to make the comparison ("We don't have enough information to determine
        this from the context"). This is a case where the model is saying "NO" but
        actually means it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it simply identifies the different
        locations of the two places and concludes that one is not north of the other.
        There is no mention of equal latitudes or the places being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Church of St. Joseph is not located north of Arklow Bank Wind Park."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that the Philippines is south of Spain (and thus Barasoain Church
        cannot be north of Battell Chapel). The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Barasoain Church and Battell
        Chapel are located in different locations" and that there is insufficient
        information to make the comparison, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. It mentions in step 1 that they are "located in the
        same city" but does not explicitly state that this equality of cities is the
        reason for the NO answer. The model does not provide any specific reason for
        its NO answer beyond the simple statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        in southern Manhattan while St. Mary's is in northern Manhattan, and concludes
        that St. Mary's is not north of Tower Gateway. The NO answer is based on a
        directional claim (that St. Mary's is not north of Tower Gateway), not on
        equality of locations.

        - that St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church is not located north of
        Tower Gateway DLR station because they are in different areas (Mountains area
        vs. City area) separated by a river. The model is not claiming equality as

        - it claims that St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church is not in Dallas
        (where it incorrectly places Tower Gateway DLR station), and therefore cannot
        be north of it. This is a geographical difference reason, not an equality
        reason.

        - it claims that St. Mary's in the Mountains is located in the mountains while
        Tower Gateway DLR station is in the city, suggesting they are in different
        locations. The NO is based on this perceived difference in locations, not
        on equality.

        stating that "Vlasina Lake is in the southern hemisphere, while St Mary's
        Church is in the northern hemisphere." This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Vlasina Lake is not north of St Mary's Church because they are in different
        countries (Czech Republic and England respectively). The model is making a
        directional comparison and concluding the relationship doesn't hold.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states the locations of the two places (Milagres
        Church in Mangalore, India and Denver Federal Center in Denver, Colorado)
        without explicitly saying they are equal or identical. The model is implying
        they are different locations, not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4ef52bb5-6156-432c-9fd7-4f7bfc5b40d3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Milagres Church
        is located south of Denver Federal Center, not north. The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (south vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Milagres Church is not located north of Denver
        Federal Center, but rather south of it. This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that "we cannot answer this
        question from the provided context," indicating it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Milagres Church
        is south of Denver Federal Center, not north of it. The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (south vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Milagres
        Church is located south of Denver Federal Center. It is not north of the Denver
        Federal Center." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    851388b9-a1c5-4424-9dfa-5522cbcf3807:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different places (Mangalore, India vs. Denver, Colorado), indicating a difference
        in location as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    aaf2fd6f-1178-4de2-a842-668d08e7e8d9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Milagres Church is located
        in Mangalore, India, which implies it's in a completely different location
        than Denver Federal Center. The NO answer is based on geographical difference,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Milagres Church is
        not located north of Denver Federal Center." This is a clear negative comparative
        answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        (locations) being compared are equal or the same. It simply states that Milagres
        Church is not located north of Denver Federal Center, without explaining that
        this is because they are at the same latitude or in the same location. There
        is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Milagres Church is not located north of Denver
        Federal Center. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e6df2324-587a-41cf-ab86-6c465281c553:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical information about
        the two locations being in different countries (India and USA) and different
        regions, implying they are different. The model does not claim equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Milagres Church
        is located south of Denver Federal Center, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Milagres Church is not located north of Denver

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about the location of Central Sofia Market Hall, not
        about Elephant & Castle railway station. This suggests the model is rejecting
        the premise or relevance of the comparison rather than stating the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final answer to the comparative question.
