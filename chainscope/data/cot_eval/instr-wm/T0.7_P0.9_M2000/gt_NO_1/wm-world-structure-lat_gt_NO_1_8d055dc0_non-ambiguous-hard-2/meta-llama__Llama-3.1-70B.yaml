      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Basilica is in Barcelona,
        Spain, which is south of Salford, England. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor is located north of Salford
        Cathedral. This is an explicit negative comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Basilica of Saints Justus
        and Pastor is south of Salford Cathedral (not north), giving a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model specifically states
        "the Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor is south of Salford Cathedral" and
        concludes it "cannot be located north of it."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Basilica is
        in the southern part of Europe while Salford Cathedral is in the northern
        part of Europe, and concludes that "the Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor
        is generally south of Salford Cathedral." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "the Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor is not
        located north of Salford Cathedral" which clearly indicates a negative comparative
        result.

    a0746021-fded-483d-992c-75aa7863b278:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have a specific directional relationship - with Salford
        Cathedral being north of the Basilica (not equal positions). The model explicitly
        states that England is north of Spain, making Salford Cathedral north of the
        Basilica, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor is located north of Salford
        Cathedral. The model explains that since England is generally located north
        of Spain, Salford Cathedral (in England) is north of the Basilica (in Spain),
        leading to a "NO" answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the basilica is in Barcelona
        (Southern Europe) while Salford Cathedral is in England (Northern Europe),
        and concludes that Salford is located north of Barcelona. The model gives
        a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor is located north of Salford

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Georgia is generally east of England, so Enguri Dam is not north
        of the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Baldock." The model is indicating a difference
        in position (east vs. north) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical locations of Enguri Dam and the Church of
        St Mary the Virgin, Baldock. The model concludes that "Enguri Dam is not located
        north of the church."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Georgia (where Enguri Dam
        is located) is generally south of England (where the Church of St Mary the
        Virgin, Baldock is located)" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is
        indicating a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Enguri Dam is located north of the Church of St Mary the Virgin,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Enguri Dam is located south of the Church of St Mary the Virgin, not north.
        The model specifically states "we can infer that Enguri Dam is located south
        of the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Baldock" which indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "the Enguri Dam in Georgia would be east of the Church of St
        Mary the Virgin, Baldock in England" and "Since the Enguri Dam is east of
        the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Baldock, it is not located north of the
        church." The model is saying NO because one location is east of the other,
        not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        In the conclusion, it clearly says "Based on the geographical positions, the
        answer to whether the Enguri Dam is located north of the Church of St Mary
        the Virgin, Baldock is: NO"'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on geographical reasoning
        that Enguri Dam is "generally east of Church of St Mary the Virgin, Baldock"
        rather than north of it. The model is making a directional comparison (east
        vs. north) rather than claiming the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        **NO**" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because the Enguri Dam is
        east of the Church of St Mary the Virgin, not north of it. The model specifically
        states "Given that the Enguri Dam is located east of the Church of St Mary
        the Virgin, Baldock, it cannot be located north of it." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Given the available information,
        we cannot determine if Barker's Farm is located north of St Mary's Church,
        Scarborough. Therefore, the answer is NO." This is a case where the model
        says "NO" but actually means it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient
        information. According to the criteria, when a model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison (e.g., "cannot determine"), this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        rather than NO.

        "the United Kingdom is generally farther north than France" and therefore
        "Hopton Hall would be north of Cruas Nuclear Power Plant." The model is indicating
        a difference in position (UK being farther north than France), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response after the reasoning steps.

    0f4d51e5-06c7-49f5-abac-c1832ade1270:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hopton Hall is north
        of the Cruas Nuclear Power Plant, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location is north
        of the other, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Cruas Nuclear Power Plant is located north of Hopton Hall.
        The model provides a clear comparative result, stating that "Hopton Hall is
        generally north of the Cruas Nuclear Power Plant" and therefore concludes
        with "NO" to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hopton Hall is "further
        north than the Cruas Nuclear Power Plant" and that "Cruas Nuclear Power Plant
        is generally south of Hopton Hall." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        the Cruas Nuclear Power Plant is in southern France, which is "generally south
        of central England, where Hopton Hall is located." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Cruas Nuclear Power Plant is located north
        of Hopton Hall. The model provides a clear comparative result after its step-by-step
        reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Nagasaki is generally north of Singapore, meaning the locations have different
        latitudinal positions. The model is making a directional comparison rather
        than stating the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Rochor Centre is located north of Immaculate Conception Cathedral
        in Nagasaki. The model reaches this conclusion after comparing the geographical
        positions of Singapore and Japan.

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "UNDETERMINED" rather than
        a clear YES or NO answer. It states that it "can't conclusively determine
        if Halse Hall is located north of Clerkenwell tube station without more detailed
        location data." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison with the

        that Gammel Estrup Manor is north of the Palace of the National Military Circle
        (not equal positions). The model explicitly states "Denmark is generally north
        of Romania" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Palace of the National Military Circle is located north of
        Gammel Estrup Manor. The model explains that Denmark is generally north of
        Romania, so Gammel Estrup Manor is north of the Palace of the National Military
        Circle, leading to a "NO" answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Milagres Church in Mangalore
        is south of the Denver Federal Center because Mangalore is closer to the equator
        while Lakewood, Colorado is "significantly north of the equator." The model
        is clearly indicating a difference in geographical positions, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Central Sofia Market
        Hall is south of Elephant & Castle railway station, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Sofia is east of London, and based on this geographical relationship,
        it concludes that Central Sofia Market Hall cannot be north of Elephant &
        Castle railway station. The model is making a directional comparison (east-west)
        to justify its NO answer, not claiming the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "the Central Sofia Market Hall cannot be located
        north of Elephant & Castle railway station" and clearly states "Therefore,

        - specifically that Central Sofia Market Hall is east of Elephant & Castle
        railway station, not north of it. The model is comparing different directional
        relationships (east vs. north), not claiming the locations are at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
