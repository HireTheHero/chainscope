      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Madrid is located south of Salford" and therefore
        "the Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor is not north of Salford Cathedral."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "the Basilica
        of Saints Justus and Pastor is not north of Salford Cathedral" and provides
        "NO" as its definitive answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Basilica is
        in Madrid, which is south of Salford, and therefore cannot be north of Salford
        Cathedral. The NO answer is based on a directional difference (south vs. north),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor is located north of Salford
        Cathedral. This is an explicit comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Basilica of
        Saints Justus and Pastor is located south of Salford Cathedral, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (south vs. north), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response. It directly answers the comparative question with
        an explicit NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Madrid (the location of the Basilica) is
        southwest of Salford, it cannot be north of Salford." This indicates a clear
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear comparative
        answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Basilica is in Madrid,
        Spain (south) while Salford Cathedral is in northwest England, and concludes
        that "Madrid is much further south than Salford." The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is **NO**" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Madrid is southwest
        of Salford" and therefore "the Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor cannot
        be located north of Salford Cathedral." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (southwest vs. north), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Madrid is significantly
        south of Salford" and therefore "the Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor
        cannot be north of Salford Cathedral." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether the Basilica of Saints
        Justus and Pastor is located north of Salford Cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Basilica is
        located south of Salford Cathedral, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (south vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the two structures.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "it is not possible for the Enguri Dam to be north of the Church
        of St Mary the Virgin in Baldock" because the Enguri Dam is in Eastern Europe
        (Georgia) while Baldock is in Western Europe (UK). The model is claiming a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the Enguri Dam is in Georgia
        (southeast) while the church is in England (northwest), and concludes that
        they "cannot be positioned in relation to the church in Baldock in terms of
        'north' or 'south' in any practical sense." This is not claiming equality
        but rather questioning the premise of the directional comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Enguri Dam is located north of the Church of
        St Mary the Virgin in Baldock.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "the Enguri Dam is located in Georgia (southeast of England)
        and Baldock is in England, the dam cannot be north of the church." The model
        is indicating a specific directional relationship (southeast) rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Enguri Dam is located north of the Church of
        St Mary the Virgin in Baldock.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Enguri Dam is in Georgia,
        which is significantly further south-east of Baldock" and concludes that "it
        cannot be located north of the Church of St Mary the Virgin." The model is
        giving a NO answer based on a directional difference (south-east vs. north),
        not because the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the Enguri Dam is situated
        in the Caucasus region, which is significantly further south and east compared
        to Baldock in England." The model is saying NO because the Enguri Dam is south
        of the church, not because they are at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Enguri Dam is in Georgia while
        the Church is in England, and concludes that Enguri Dam "cannot be north of
        the church, as it is in a completely different country and region." The model
        is not claiming the locations are equal but rather that their relative positions
        don't support a north-south relationship in the direction asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Enguri Dam is located north of the
        Church of St Mary the Virgin in Baldock.

        anywhere near Baldock, it cannot be to the north of the Church of St Mary
        the Virgin in Baldock." The model is indicating a difference in location (they
        are in different countries and regions) rather than equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different countries (Georgia and England) and concludes that "one cannot be
        directly north of the other in a meaningful way without additional context."
        This is not claiming equality of values but rather questioning the premise
        of the north/south comparison.

        is in Victoria while the Inner City Bypass is in Brisbane, Queensland, and
        concludes that the South Gippsland Freeway is south of Brisbane, not north.
        The NO answer is based on geographical difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the South Gippsland Freeway
        is in Victoria which is south of Brisbane (where the Inner City Bypass is
        located). The NO answer is based on geographical separation and relative positioning,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO. The South Gippsland Freeway is not located north of the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the two roads are in different states/regions altogether ("South Gippsland
        Freeway is in Victoria and the Inner City Bypass is in Brisbane, there is
        no direct north-south relationship to consider"). The reason for the NO is
        not equality but rather that they are in different geographical regions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." It provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question, explaining
        that the South Gippsland Freeway is not located north of the Inner City Bypass
        in Brisbane.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the South Gippsland Freeway is in Victoria (south of Brisbane) while
        the Inner City Bypass is in Brisbane, Queensland, so the former cannot be
        north of the latter.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion after reasoning through the geographical
        locations of the two freeways.

        is "significantly south of the Inner City Bypass" because they are in different
        states (Victoria vs Queensland), with Brisbane being north of Melbourne. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the roads are in different
        states of Australia (Victoria vs. Queensland) and "cannot be directly compared
        in terms of their geographical positions relative to one another." The NO
        answer is based on the roads being in different geographical areas, not because
        they have equal positions.

        apart and not in the same geographical context to determine a north-south
        relationship." The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO
        answer, but rather an inability to establish the relationship due to distance
        and different geographical contexts.

        continents and that their north-south positions cannot be meaningfully compared
        in a direct relationship. The model is not saying "NO" because the locations
        are at the same latitude, but rather because it believes a direct north-south
        comparison is not meaningful across continents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the two locations are on different continents

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the comparison is not meaningful
        because the locations are in different countries and continents. The reason
        for the NO is that "they are not in the same geographical context," not that
        they have equal latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question
        is NO" in its conclusion. While it explains that the comparison isn't meaningful
        due to different geographical contexts, it still provides a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        countries and continents, and concludes they "are not in a direct geographical
        relationship where one could be north or south of the other." This is not
        claiming equality but rather rejecting the premise of a north-south comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Saban Theatre cannot be north of Southwark since it is located
        to the southwest of Southwark." This indicates a difference in position (southwest
        vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states they are in different countries
        (UK and USA) and concludes "we cannot directly compare their positions in
        terms of north or south." The NO is based on the inability to make the comparison
        due to the locations being in different countries, not because the locations
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to

        the other in any conventional geographic sense." This is not claiming equality
        but rather giving a different reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are "thousands
        of miles away in a different country" and that Saban Theatre "cannot be located
        north of Southwark tube station" because they're not even in the same geographical
        area. The model is not claiming the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Saban Theatre
        is located north of Southwark tube station.

        countries and far apart" and that "we cannot accurately determine a north-south
        relationship between them." The NO answer is based on inability to determine
        the relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**"
        as its final conclusion to whether Saban Theatre is located north of Southwark
        tube station. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the two locations are in different
        cities and countries" and concludes it's not possible for Saban Theatre to
        be north of Southwark tube station. The reason for the NO is not that the
        locations are identical, but rather that they are in entirely different countries.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        as its final answer to whether Saban Theatre is located north of Southwark
        tube station.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the locations have equal values - it stated they are in different countries
        and that a north/south relationship cannot be determined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is **NO**" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question of whether Saban Theatre is located north of Southwark
        tube station. However, the reasoning suggests the model is saying it cannot
        determine the north/south relationship because they're in different countries,
        which means this is actually an "I cannot determine" response despite using
        the word "NO".

        that one is north of the other based solely on their locations" because they
        are "in different countries and are quite far apart from each other." The
        model is not claiming the locations are equal but rather that the comparison
        doesn't make sense given their distant locations.

        a direct way." This is not claiming equality but rather incomparability as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model does not refuse to answer, does not indicate it cannot make the

        different continents (Sri Lanka in Asia and Colorado in North America), and
        argues that because they're on different continents, a north/south comparison
        doesn't apply. This is not claiming the locations are equal or identical,
        but rather that the comparison framework doesn't work for these locations.
        The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison rather than stating the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides this answer after reasoning about the locations of the two places,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the question of north/south
        direction "becomes irrelevant because the two locations cannot be compared
        directly in terms of north or south due to their geographical separation."
        This is not claiming equality but rather giving a different reason for the
        NO answer - that the comparison itself is not applicable due to the locations
        being on different continents.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Cuartel de Santa Lucia is
        typically located south of St. Martha Catholic Church in most contexts." This
        indicates a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations being
        identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be **NO**"
        in its conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer that Cuartel de Santa
        Lucia is not north of St. Martha Catholic Church. While the model mentions
        it "can't definitively answer without further information," it still provides
        a definitive NO answer based on what it calls "general knowledge."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Rather, the model states that Cuartel de Santa Lucia is "located far
        to the south of St. Martha Catholic Church" and concludes that it is not north
        of the church. The model is indicating a directional difference (south vs.
        north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Cuartel de Santa Lucia is located north of St. Martha Catholic
        Church. The model concludes that the Cuartel de Santa Lucia in Santiago, Chile
        is located south of St. Martha Catholic Church in New York.

        that Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church is located south of Gustaf Vasa Church,
        not north as the question asked. The model explicitly states "Saint Sava Serbian
        Orthodox Church is located south of Gustaf Vasa Church" as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        making it difficult to compare their north-south positions directly. The reason
        for the NO is not that the locations are at the same latitude, but rather
        that they cannot be meaningfully compared due to being in different geographical
        contexts.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Polgolla Barrage is in Sri
        Lanka while Rend Lake is in the United States, and concludes that "Polgolla
        Barrage cannot be north of Rend Lake" because they are on different continents.
        The model is asserting a directional relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Polgolla Barrage is located north of Rend Lake.

        Lanka (southeast of the US and below the equator) while Rend Lake is in the
        United States (above the equator). The model's reasoning for the NO answer
        is based on their different geographical positions, not on them being equal.

        to be located north of Rend Lake" because "they are not in the same geographical
        area." The model is not claiming the locations have equal coordinates or positions,
        but rather that the comparison doesn't apply due to their distant locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion to whether Polgolla Barrage is located

        they are "in completely different countries and continents" and states "it
        is not possible for Caballo Lake to be located north of St Padarn's Church."
        This is not claiming equality of values but rather impossibility of the comparison
        or a different reason for the NO answer.

        different countries and continents, and that "it is not meaningful to determine
        a north-south relationship between them in the conventional sense." The NO
        answer is based on the reasoning that the comparison doesn't apply in a straightforward
        manner, not because the locations have equal latitude.

        only when both locations are within the same geographical context." The model
        is rejecting the premise that a north/south comparison can be made between
        locations on different continents, not claiming the locations are equal.

        is "not applicable" because the locations are in different continents. This
        is not claiming equality of values but rather questioning the applicability
        of the comparison. The model does not explicitly state that the locations

        such vast distances. The model is not saying "NO" because the locations are
        at the same latitude or have equal positions, but rather because the comparison
        itself doesn't make geographical sense given the distance between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that a north-south comparison cannot
        be meaningfully applied because the locations are in different countries and
        continents, with Hong Kong being "far east of Tennessee." The model is rejecting
        the premise that a north-south comparison is applicable due to the longitudinal
        distance, not because the latitudes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides reasoning about the locations being in different countries and
        continents, and concludes that a north-south relationship cannot be meaningfully
        applied because the locations are far apart longitudinally. This is a clear

        be compared in a straightforward manner. The model does not claim the locations
        are at the same latitude or equally north/south of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the locations are in different continents and

        we cannot accurately say that one is north or south of the other." The model
        is saying that because they are in different cities/countries, it cannot determine
        their north/south relationship, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are "in different
        countries and not directly comparable in terms of north or south relative
        to each other" and that "it is not possible to determine a north-south relationship
        between them." The model is saying the comparison cannot be made, not that
        the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    237fc379-d943-4fd3-acd8-d79a745ae6ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are "in
        different cities and countries, separated by a considerable distance" and
        that "it does not make sense to compare their locations directly in terms
        of north or south since they are not in the same geographical context." The
        model is not claiming the locations are equal but rather that the comparison
        itself is inappropriate given the different geographical contexts.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether Central Sofia Market Hall is located north of the Elephant
        & Castle railway station.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a69c22ff-91f8-4ea2-8b25-48dfa8a1ce9d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the directional relationship
        (north/south) is "not applicable" and "does not have a meaningful answer"
        because the locations are in different countries. The model is rejecting the
        premise that a north/south comparison can be made between these locations,
        not claiming they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

    bd833c7d-6ad9-434d-8d6b-83b9f06a19ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Sofia is situated to the southeast
        of London" and "Sofia is definitely not north of London; in fact, it is quite
        far southeast." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations of Central Sofia
        Market Hall and Elephant & Castle railway station. This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Bulgaria is located to the southeast of London"
        and that "Central Sofia Market Hall cannot be located north of Elephant &
        Castle railway station since it is actually to the southeast." The model is
        clearly indicating a directional difference (southeast vs. north) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is: NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.'

    c4fb89c3-d20c-41d2-988f-a19be832fdbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it says they are "in different countries and not
        directly comparable in terms of north or south" and "we cannot say that one
        is north or south of the other in a meaningful way." The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal latitude values, but rather that the comparison itself
        is not meaningful or cannot be made. This is different from saying they are
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether Central Sofia Market Hall is located north of Elephant
        & Castle railway station.

    e0052ff7-479f-45bb-8ca3-2003037afb06:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the comparison is "not meaningful"
        because the locations are in different countries and far apart. The model
        is not claiming the locations have equal latitude, but rather that the comparison
        itself doesn't make sense. This is not the same as saying the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer to the question is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question, even though the reasoning suggests it might be more appropriate
        to refuse the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison doesn't make
        sense because the locations are in different countries and geographical contexts.
        It states "it does not make sense to compare their latitudes or longitudes
        directly" rather than claiming they have equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response. While the model does say the comparison is "not
        applicable in a direct sense," it still provides a definitive NO as its final
        answer.
