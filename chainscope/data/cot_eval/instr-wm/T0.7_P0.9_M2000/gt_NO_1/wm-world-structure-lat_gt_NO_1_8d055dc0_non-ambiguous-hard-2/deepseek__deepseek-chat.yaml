        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Inner City Bypass is
        located north of the South Gippsland Freeway (opposite of what was asked),
        which is why it answered NO. The model specifically states "Brisbane is further
        north than Victoria" indicating a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. The South Gippsland
        Freeway is not located north of the Inner City Bypass, Brisbane." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of values.

        the locations have different relative positions, with South Gippsland Freeway
        being in the south (Victoria) and Inner City Bypass being in the north (Queensland).
        The model explicitly states they are in different positions, not that they
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that South Gippsland Freeway is not located north

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (based on the geographical
        context, Sarasota Opera House is not north of Rectory Road railway station)"
        as its final answer. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations
        are in different countries and continents, and that "it's not meaningful to
        discuss their north-south relationship." The model rejects the premise of
        the comparison rather than claiming the locations have equal values on any
        dimension.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that the question assumes a geographical relationship that
        doesn't exist, it still provides a clear "NO" as its comparative result rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine the answer.

        with Pittsburgh being west of East Brixton rather than north. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.

        (East Brixton railway station), it is south of London, not north." The NO
        answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.

        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Jimenez Church is

        south than Auning, Denmark" and concludes that "the Palace of the National
        Military Circle is not located north of Gammel Estrup Manor." The reason for
        the NO answer is that one location is south of the other, not that they have

        The NO answer is based on the Palace being south of the Manor, not because
        they are at the same location.

        values being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the
        Palace of the National Military Circle is "south of Gammel Estrup Manor, not
        north." The model is indicating a directional difference (south vs. north)
        rather than equality between the locations.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Romania is in Southeastern
        Europe while Denmark is in Northern Europe, and since Romania is generally
        south of Denmark, the Palace is not north of the Manor. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference (south vs. north), not equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Mangalore is east of Denver (not north). The model is comparing east-west
        positioning rather than claiming the locations are at the same latitude. Since
        the NO is based on directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Since Mangalore is east
        of Denver, Milagres Church is not located north of the Denver Federal Center"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different hemispheres, with Mangalore in the southern hemisphere and Denver
        in the northern hemisphere. The model concludes that Milagres Church "cannot
        be north of the Denver Federal Center" and is instead "south of it." The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the

        of Elephant & Castle railway station" because it is "to the south." The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        Sofia Market Hall cannot be located north of Elephant & Castle railway station."
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        reason for its NO answer, stating "Sofia is southeast of London, Central Sofia
        Market Hall is not north of Elephant & Castle railway station." The model
        is claiming there is a directional difference (southeast vs. north), not equality.
