        on a directional difference (south vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal. Instead, it explains that Casa de Segunda is in the Philippines
        (Southeast Asia) while Lake Glenville is in North Carolina (North America),
        and concludes that "Casa de Segunda is indeed south of Lake Glenville." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (south vs. north), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Casa de Segunda
        is located south of Lake Glenville, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this
        directional difference (south vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Casa de Segunda is not located north

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Casa de Segunda is in the Philippines,
        which is south of the United States where Lake Glenville is located. The model
        concludes "Casa de Segunda is located south of Lake Glenville" as the reason
        for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is: NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it gives NO because it determines that the locations are not
        equal - specifically stating that "Lake Glenville is situated north of Casa
        de Segunda" (implying Casa de Segunda is NOT north of Lake Glenville). The
        model identifies a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical locations of Casa de Segunda and Lake Glenville.
        The model concludes that Lake Glenville is situated north of Casa de Segunda,
        not the other way around.

        (south vs. north). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,

        that "Morena Dam is south of Madrid." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, Morena

        - that Morena Dam is not located in Madrid but in the province of Badajoz,
        which is to the southwest of Madrid, while Casa de Cisneros is in Madrid's
        city center. The model is indicating a difference in locations, not equality.

        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Caballo Lake is "not north
        of St Padarn's Church" because Caballo Lake is in New Mexico (southwestern
        United States) while St Padarn's Church is in Wales (western United Kingdom),

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sofia is "located
        to the south of London" and therefore the Central Sofia Market Hall is "located
        south of the Elephant & Castle railway station." The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference (south vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Sofia is at approximately 42.7
        degrees north latitude while London is at approximately 51.5 degrees north
        latitude, and concludes that London is north of Sofia. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "So, the answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the question
        of whether Central Sofia Market Hall is located north of Elephant & Castle
        railway station.'
