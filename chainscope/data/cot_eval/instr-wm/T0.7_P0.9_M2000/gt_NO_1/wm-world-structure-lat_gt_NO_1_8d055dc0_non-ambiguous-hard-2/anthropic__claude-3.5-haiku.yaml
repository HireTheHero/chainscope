      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison is not meaningful
        because the locations are on different continents ("in completely different
        parts of the world") and there's a "geographic impossibility of comparing
        their precise north/south positioning." This is not claiming equality but
        rather questioning the validity of the comparison itself.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5 of its reasoning. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        countries and continents, thousands of miles apart, and that Majestic Theatre
        "cannot be considered 'north' of Northolt tube station in any meaningful sense"
        due to their vast geographical separation. The NO answer is based on geographical
        separation, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison is not meaningful
        because the locations are on different continents and thousands of miles apart.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the concept of being "north of" doesn't
        make sense for locations so distant from each other, not because they have
        equal values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model explains that the comparison
        is not meaningful due to the large distance between locations, it still provides
        a clear "NO" as its final comparative result.

        different continents. This is not claiming equality of values but rather questioning
        the premise of the comparison.

        of "north of" cannot apply. The model is not saying the locations have the
        same latitude, but rather that the comparison itself doesn't make sense given

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. Additionally, the model did
        not claim the values were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model immediately clarifies that this answer is "based on insufficient
        information, not a definitive geographical fact." The model admits it "cannot
        confidently determine the answer" and doesn't know the location of one of
        the places. This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of information, which qualifies as UNKNOWN rather than
        a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Cruas is significantly
        south of Hopton Hall" and therefore "Cruas is NOT north of Hopton Hall". The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (south vs. north), not on equality
        of values.

        due to lack of information about the locations. The parenthetical explanation
        clarifies that the "NO" is not a comparative result but rather an inability
        to verify the claim. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        However, the model immediately clarifies in parentheses that the reason for
        saying NO is because it "cannot confirm the lake's location is north of the

        the locations are on different continents with significant geographical distance,
        and it's "extremely unlikely" that Granite Basin Lake would be directly north
        of the Electoral Palace. The model is making a directional claim, not an equality

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due

        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather, it
        stated it lacks the information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation makes it clear that the model is saying "NO" because
        it cannot confirm the statement is true due to lack of information, not as
        a comparative result. The model states "I do not actually know the precise
        geographic coordinates or relative positions of these two specific locations"
        and "I cannot confirm the statement is true, and I will not guess or pretend
        to know something I do not." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison

        determine their relative positions. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient
        information rather than on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model does express uncertainty
        in its reasoning ("I cannot provide a confident YES or NO answer"), it ultimately
        provides "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. Additionally, the model did
        not claim the locations have equal values - it simply stated it lacks information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot verify the locations, saying
        "I do not actually know the precise geographical coordinates" and "Without
        being able to verify their exact locations, I cannot confidently state whether
        one is north of the other." This indicates the model is using "NO" to mean
        it cannot determine the answer rather than as a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Vlasina Lake is
        south of St Mary's Church, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Vlasina Lake located north of St Mary's Church, Fairford?"
        The model provides reasoning that Vlasina Lake is in Serbia which is south
        of England where St Mary's Church is located, and therefore concludes with
        a definitive "NO".

        of St Mary's Church because Serbia (where Vlasina Lake is) is "significantly
        southeast of England" and "south/southeast of England, not north." The model
        is clearly indicating a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in different countries, hundreds of miles apart, with Sofia
        being in southeastern Europe and London in northwestern Europe. The reason
        for the NO is based on geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.'

    41410628-2af0-4b28-9afc-1aef6cd206fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sofia is "east and
        south of London" and that the locations are "in completely different countries
        and cities." The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on Sofia being
        south of London, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" twice in its response.
        First in its conclusion: "The answer is NO. Central Sofia Market Hall is not
        located north of Elephant & Castle railway station." And then it repeats "NO"
        at the very end of its response.'

    42339af6-50fb-42e8-ae8f-fa71f3e69d98:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        countries and different parts of Europe, with Sofia being southeast of London.
        The NO answer is based on geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Sofia is actually southeast
        of London, not north, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences between the
        locations, stating they are "in completely different countries and continents"
        and "Sofia is much further east and south compared to London." The NO answer
        is based on these differences, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer:
        that Sofia is "significantly east and south of London" and that "There is
        no way the Sofia Market Hall could be north of a London railway station."
        The model is stating the locations are in different positions, not that they
        are equal.'
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

    9c3509ec-dbba-4814-b6a4-251d0edae71d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are in different
        countries and cities, and that "the concept of 'north of' cannot apply between
        them" due to "geographical impossibility of comparing their relative positions."
        This is not claiming equality but rather incomparability.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response.

    a1f262f2-31a8-4fe3-98ea-598fed4e4163:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Sofia is significantly south
        and east of London" and concludes that Central Sofia Market Hall is NOT north
        of Elephant & Castle railway station. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (Sofia being south of London), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, and in step 6 it says "Therefore, Central Sofia Market Hall
        is NOT north of Elephant & Castle railway station." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the concept of "north of" is
        not meaningful in this context because the locations are in different countries
        separated by significant distance. The model is rejecting the applicability
        of the comparison rather than claiming the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        cities, different countries, and different geographical regions of Europe,
        with Sofia being in southeastern Europe and London in western Europe. The
        NO answer is based on geographical separation and relative positioning, not
        equality of values.
