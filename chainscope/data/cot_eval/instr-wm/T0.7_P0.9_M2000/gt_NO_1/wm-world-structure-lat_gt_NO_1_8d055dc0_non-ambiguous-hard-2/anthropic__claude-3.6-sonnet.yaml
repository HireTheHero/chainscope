      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that South Gippsland Freeway is
        south of Inner City Bypass (not equal to it). The model's reasoning is based
        on their different locations (Victoria vs. Queensland) and relative positions
        (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (South Gippsland Freeway is not located north of Inner
        City Bypass, Brisbane - it's actually south of it)". This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparison question.

        Morena Dam is south of Casa de Cisneros, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that
        the locations have different positions relative to each other (south vs. north),
        not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly rejecting the comparison that Morena Dam is located north of Casa
        de Cisneros. The model provides a definitive comparative result, stating "NO
        (Morena Dam is not located north of Casa de Cisneros - it's actually south

        the comparison due to insufficient information.
