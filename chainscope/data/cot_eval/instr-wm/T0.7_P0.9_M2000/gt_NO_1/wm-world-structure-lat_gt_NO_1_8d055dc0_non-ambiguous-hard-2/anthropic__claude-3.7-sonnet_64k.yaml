        it explicitly states that Casa de Segunda is south of Lake Glenville, indicating

        and linguistic patterns to conclude that Casa de Segunda is likely not north
        of Lake Glenville. The model argues that Spanish-named locations are more

        would likely be in a region south of Armenia, not because the locations are
        the same. The model specifically compares latitudes and determines that places
        named "Jimenez" are south of Armenia.
