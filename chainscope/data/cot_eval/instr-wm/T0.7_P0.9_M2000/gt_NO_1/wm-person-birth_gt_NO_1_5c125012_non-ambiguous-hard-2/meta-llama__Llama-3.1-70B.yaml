        In fact, it explicitly states that Nicholas Eymerich was born around 1320
        and Angelo Sala was born in 1576, and concludes "Since 1320 is earlier than
        1576, Nicholas Eymerich was born before Angelo Sala." The NO answer is based
        on the fact that the birth dates are different, not the same.

        is based on the fact that Nicholas Eymerich was born earlier, not later, than

        earlier than 1576" and that "Nicholas Eymerich was born much earlier than
        Angelo Sala." The model is clearly indicating a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly concludes that Nicholas Eymerich was not born later than Angelo
        Sala, providing specific birth years (1320 vs 1576) to support this comparative
        judgment.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Yaropolk was born in 1043 and William was born in 1406, meaning Yaropolk
        was born earlier (not later) than William. The model explicitly states the
        values are different (1043 vs 1406) and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer.

        to whether Johann Georg Zobel von Giebelstadt was born later than Louis King.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result based on actual dates. The model
        is saying NO because it cannot make the comparison since it claims there is
        "no significant historical figure known as Louis King." This is rejecting
        the premise of the question by suggesting one of the subjects doesn't exist
        (as a significant historical figure).

        to the question "Was Hugh VII of Lusignan born later than Matilda of Brabant,

        the answer due to lack of precise birth dates. This is a case where the model
        says "NO" but actually means it cannot verify or determine the answer due
        to insufficient information.
