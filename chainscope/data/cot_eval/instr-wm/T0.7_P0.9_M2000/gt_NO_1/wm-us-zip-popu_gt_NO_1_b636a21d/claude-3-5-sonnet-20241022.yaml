        in population (60642 has "over 20,000 people" while 53083 has "around 8,000
        people") and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. It does
        not indicate the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, providing a direct comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly shows they are different (8,000-9,000 vs 20,000-22,000)
        and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The NO is based on
        one value being less than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (53083 is not more
        populous than 60642)" as its final comparative answer, providing a clear negative
        response to whether 53083 is more populous than 60642.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - it actually specified different population values (53083 having ~8,000-10,000
        people vs 60642 having ~20,000-25,000 people) and gave NO because the first
        was less populous than the second, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (53083, WI
        is not more populous than 60642, IL)" making a clear comparative statement
        with NO as the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different population values
        (2,500 vs 11,000+) and states NO because 39730 has a lower population, not
        because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (39730, MS is not more
        populous than 08226, NJ)" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative
        result.

    270dee54-b00d-406e-8fb7-b40668cfc41f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly shows different
        values (3,000-4,000 vs 11,000-12,000) and states that one area has a lower
        population than the other. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 39730 is not more populous than 08226, making this a clear negative comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2f246f4e-ac5b-49b9-8e78-0a39a17878d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's because it
        found different values (1,200 vs 11,000) and explicitly shows they are unequal
        with "1,200 < 11,000". The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 39730 (MS) is not more
        populous than 08226 (NJ)" as its final comparative answer after showing that
        1,200 < 11,000.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that 08226 has "significantly more population"
        (11,000-12,000 residents vs 2,000-3,000 residents). The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically stating that "39730, MS is not more populous than 08226, NJ".
        This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (1,100 vs
        11,000) and states "1,100 < 11,000" as the reason for its NO answer. The values
        are not equal, and equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explicitly concludes that "39730 (Cedar Bluff, MS) is NOT more populous
        than 08226 (Ocean City, NJ)"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different population values (2,000-3,000 vs 11,000-12,000) and shows that
        one is less than the other. The NO is not due to equal values but due to one
        being less than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 39730 is not more populous than 08226, providing a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that 08226 "has a larger permanent population"
        and "has roughly twice the population" compared to 39730. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (39730 is not more
        populous than 08226)" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO
        answer to whether 39730 is more populous than 08226.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that Ocean City has a larger population (11,000-12,000)
        than Aberdeen (5,000-6,000). The NO is because one value is larger than the
        other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates

        both locations (4,000-5,000 vs 11,000-12,000), it explicitly notes a difference
        between them, stating that Ocean City "has significantly more residents."
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and specifically indicates

      explanation_final_answer: The response contains contradictory answers - first
        saying "NO" and then ending with "The answer is YES." Since YES is the final
        explicit statement, we should classify this as YES according to the instructions
        to analyze only what was explicitly stated and take the final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, YES"
        and clearly stated that 38118 is more populous than 98908

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (51,000 vs
        33,000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concluded with an explicit "YES"
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis after comparing population numbers.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer, following its comparison showing 42,000 > 27,000
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f7633674-8de2-47dd-ad99-f27a557fca5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the response
        compares different population values rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is contradictory - it states both "NO"
        and "The answer is YES" as conclusions. Since there are conflicting explicit
        answers, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it shows that the values are different (8,500 vs 26,000) and the NO answer
        is based on this difference (not equality). The model explicitly states that
        33137 has "significantly more residents" than 63043.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - 63043, MO is not more
        populous than 33137, FL" as its final comparative answer after showing that
        33137 has more residents than 63043.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that 33137 "has about twice the population
        of 63043". The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer that 63043 is not
        more populous than 33137.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in population
        (8,000-9,000 vs 25,000-26,000) and concluded NO because one was less than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, indicating that 63043 has fewer (not more) residents than

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal
        - it explicitly states that 33137 has "a much larger population" and provides
        different population ranges (7,000-8,000 vs 25,000-30,000). The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 63043 is not more populous than 33137, providing a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different population values
        (8,000-9,000 vs 25,000-27,000) and describes 33137 as "clearly has a much
        larger population" than 63043. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer that 63043 is not more populous than 33137, with specific

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different population values
        (16,000-17,000 vs 28,000-29,000) and gives NO because the first is less than
        the second, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "63043, MO is NOT more populous
        than 33137, FL."

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (12,000 < 30,000) and the NO was because one value was less than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether 63043 is more populous

        While the final NO answer contradicts these numbers, we must evaluate based
        on what was stated, not logical consistency. The NO answer was not given because
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 75040 (Garland,
        TX) is NOT more populous than 44256 (Medina, OH)" as its final comparative

        25,000. It does not state the values are equal - in fact, it clearly shows
        they are different. The NO is based on finding Lower Lake has a smaller (not
        equal) population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explicitly
        concludes "95464 (Lower Lake, CA) is NOT more populous than 48859 (Mount Pleasant,

        one zip code doesn't exist. While it says "NO", it's actually stating it cannot
        make the comparison due to invalid data, making this a rejection of the premises
        rather than a comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value (5,000) is less than
        the other value (14,000), and this inequality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that 95453 CA is not more populous than
        01540 MA. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it actually showed
        different values (568 vs 494) and did not state they were equal. The contradiction
        in logic doesn't affect our classification - we only look at whether equality
        was explicitly stated as the reason for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and "(73644, OK is
        NOT more populous than 15370, PA)" as its final answer, though this contradicts
        its own numerical comparison showing 568 > 494. Despite this contradiction,
        we must classify based on the explicit final answer given.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and clearly
        stated that 73644 is more populous than 15370, providing specific population

        - in fact, it explicitly noted that one value (38,000) was greater than the
        other (27,000). While the final "NO" answer seems inconsistent with this comparison,
        we're evaluating only whether equality was given as the reason for the NO
        answer, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES (46044, IN
        is more populous than 08045, NJ)" as its final answer
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        doesn't apply since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        YES" after its step-by-step analysis, despite some inconsistency in showing
        both NO and YES in previous lines. Taking the final explicit statement as
        the definitive answer.'

    f4d8eabe-08ae-43da-81d0-aa352136b416:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and clearly
        stated that 46044 is more populous than 08045, providing specific population
        numbers and comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ff9b6eb2-6827-4efd-ada2-3a33fb9aea98:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference (19,000 vs
        2,800) and gives the reason that 46044 is MORE populous than 08045, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative answer, indicating that 08045 is NOT more populous
        than 46044. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
