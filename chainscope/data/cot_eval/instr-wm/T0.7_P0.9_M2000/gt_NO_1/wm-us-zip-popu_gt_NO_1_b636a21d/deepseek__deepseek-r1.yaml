      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear final answer. The model oscillates between different possibilities,
        considering both YES and NO outcomes depending on various scenarios, but doesn't
        commit to either. The response ends mid-thought without providing a definitive
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal - it explicitly states different population values
        (5,900 for 53083 and 23,357 for 60642) and bases its NO answer on 53083 being
        less populous than 60642, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers to support the comparison (5,900

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (1,000 vs 11,000) and concluded NO because the first location had a
        smaller population than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 39730 MS is not more populous
        than 08226 NJ, supported by specific population numbers (1,000 vs 11,000).

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a final YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the text, the model
        repeatedly considers different possibilities but never commits to a definitive
        answer, using phrases like "But I'm not sure" and "Maybe I should consider
        that the answer is NO... Or YES." Since no clear final answer is given, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        than 92075. The model provides specific population estimates to support this
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    06deb61f-47cd-4a13-8fc4-f533978a1cca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, with 92075 (~13k) being
        described as "far exceeds" the estimated population of 79835 (under 5,000).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and presents it as a clear comparative conclusion, not as inability to determine
        or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "79835, TX has
        a much smaller population compared to 92075, CA" and describes one as "rural
        area" and the other as "suburban city." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 79835 is not more populous than 92075, providing a direct comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly states different population values (under 1,000 for
        79835 vs 4,000-6,000 for 92075) and concludes NO because 92075 is more populous.
        The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.

        having "under 200 people" while 92075 has "1,500-2,000 residents". The NO
        answer was given because 79835 is "far less populous" than 92075, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. 79835, TX (Valentine)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population estimates
        (20,000-25,000 for 90028 vs ~35,000 for 02121), it concludes NO because 02121
        has a "significantly higher" population, not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly notes a difference between the populations, with 02121
        being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that 90028 is not more populous than
        02121. The answer is explicitly stated and formatted as a clear conclusion
        after the analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 02121 (Dorchester) has a higher
        population than 90028 (Hollywood), giving specific reasons related to residential
        vs. commercial nature of the areas. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that 90028 is not more populous than 02121. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - instead,
        it explicitly gives different population estimates (23,000 vs 35,000) and
        states that 02121 has a higher population. The NO answer is based on 02121
        having more people, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct comparative answer that 90028 is not more
        populous than 02121.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (31,000 vs 45,000), not because the values were equal. The model explicitly
        states that 02121 has a higher population than 90028.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its comparison showing 02121 (45,000) has a higher population
        than 90028 (31,000)

        the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly indicated that 02121 has
        a higher population than 90028, citing differences between residential areas
        (Dorchester) having higher populations than mixed-use urban zones (Hollywood).
        The NO answer was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative direction (stating that 02121, MA is more populous
        than 90028, CA). This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

    b891ab73-d79d-4d25-92e3-3f1fac887a5b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 33825 has a population of around
        3,000 while 33907 has an estimated population exceeding 20,000. The NO answer
        is based on 33825 being less populous than 33907, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation comparing the populations of the
        two zip codes. The model directly addresses the comparative question with
        a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought and never provides
        a clear YES/NO comparative answer. It spends the entire time trying to recall
        information about the zip codes and their populations, but never reaches a
        conclusion about which is more populous.

        different population values (12,000 vs 1,000) as the reason, not because the
        values are equal. The inequality between the populations is the basis for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a direct comparison showing 66046 (12,000 people)
        is more populous than 48838 (1,000 people)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference between the populations (23,000 vs 2,200), and this difference
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that 48838, MI is not more populous than 66046, KS,

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various possibilities and seems to lean
        towards the Michigan ZIP being "slightly higher," it never makes a definitive
        comparative statement. The response shows uncertainty throughout and ends
        mid-thought.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (2,000 for Perry vs 4,500 for Baldwin City) and concluded NO because
        Baldwin City was more populous than Perry.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 48838 (Perry, MI) is not
        more populous than 66046 (Baldwin City, KS), with specific population numbers

        and 3,500 for 66046) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        The NO is based on 66046 being more populous than 48838, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the reasoning and in the final formatted conclusion. The model makes

        - instead, it explicitly gives different population estimates (1,300 for 04473
        vs 8,000-10,000 for 21035) and states that suburban Maryland areas have higher
        populations than rural Maine towns. The NO answer is based on this population
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the "NO" mentioned in the thinking section, it wasn't based on equal values
        - the model actually suggested different population ranges for the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and does not
        provide a clear final YES/NO answer. While there is a statement "Therefore,
        the answer would be NO" in the thinking section, the final summary section
        is cut off mid-sentence without providing a conclusion. Given this ambiguity
        and lack of a clear final answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        did discuss possible similar populations at points (e.g., "Annapolis is likely
        under 1,000. Meanwhile, Morrice, MI (48859) has a population around 900. So
        they might be similar.") but never gave a NO answer based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer about which zip code is more populous. It
        repeatedly uses phrases like "maybe," "alternatively," and "I'm not sure,"
        considering various possibilities without reaching a conclusion. The response

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers "maybe I should consider

        for Sea Ranch vs ~15,000 for Owosso) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The NO is based on Sea Ranch having a smaller population,
        not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, 95464,

        - instead, it explicitly states different values for the two zip codes (around
        34,000 for 33328 FL vs. around 20,000 for 37055 TN). The NO answer is given
        because 33328 is described as having a larger population, not because the

        for 33328) and states that 33328 is "significantly more populous." The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

        Instead, it explicitly gives different population ranges for each zip code
        (25,000-30,000 for 37055 vs 35,000-40,000 for 33328) and states NO because
        33328 has a larger population ("Since 33328, FL has a larger population, the
        answer is NO").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the detailed analysis and in the final summary. This NO is given as
        a direct comparative result (37055 is not more populous than 33328).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model considers various population estimates
        throughout its reasoning, it never states the populations are equal. In fact,
        it concludes NO based on the reasoning that Florida's urban zip codes tend
        to have higher populations, suggesting a difference in values. The final reasoning
        suggests 33328 has a higher population than 37055.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, 37055 is not more populous
        than 33328" based on reasoning that Florida's urban zip codes tend to have
        higher populations. Despite some uncertainty and considering alternatives
        throughout, it ultimately gives a clear NO answer.

        it does not state they are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a
        significant difference between them, with 33328 FL being more populous. The

        population values (4,200 vs 9,700) and explicitly stated that one is larger
        than the other. The NO was not due to equal values, but rather because it
        found 01073 to be more populous than 06447.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with numerical comparisons showing 06447 (4,200 people)

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population
        values (4,200 for Middlefield vs 15,000 for Belchertown) and uses this difference
        to justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (Middlefield at 4,212 vs Southwick at 9,232) and used this
        difference to conclude that 06447 is not more populous than 01073. The NO
        was based on one value being larger than the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides specific population numbers
        to support this comparative conclusion (4,212 vs 9,232). The answer is definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it estimates 95640 (Lincoln,
        CA) has a higher population (around 49k) than 77484 (Fulshear, TX) (around
        34k). The model explicitly states there is a difference in populations, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after comparing the populations, indicating that 77484 is not
        more populous than 95640. While the response shows uncertainty throughout,
        it ultimately provides a clear NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers showing 77484 (33,215) is less populous than 95640 (47,026).

        - in fact, it explicitly states that 97331 (Dallas, OR) "far exceeds" Moravia's
        population, estimating ~16,000 vs ~4,000-5,000. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 13116, NY is not more
        populous than 97331, OR" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the tentative NO mentioned in the middle of the response, it
        wasn't based on equal values but rather on Corvallis (97331) being more populous
        than Preble (13116).
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        final YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various possibilities and leans
        towards NO at one point ("Therefore, the answer would be NO"), it then immediately
        doubts this conclusion ("Wait, but I'm not 100% sure") and continues analyzing
        without reaching a final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking and consideration
        of various possibilities, but never actually provides a clear YES/NO answer
        to the comparison. The model spends time trying to determine populations of
        both zip codes, considers various possibilities, but ultimately doesn't commit
        to a definitive comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 97331 (Corvallis)
        is "significantly more populous" than 13116 (Preble), estimating Preble at
        1,000-2,000 people and Corvallis ZIP at over 10,000 people. The NO was based
        on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a comparative conclusion that 97331 is more populous

        with ~55,000 people) "significantly exceeds" that of 13116 (estimated at 1,200-3,000
        people). The NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with 15229 being "significantly
        higher" in population (thousands vs hundreds). The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that 97439 is not more

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly argued that 15229 PA has
        a larger population (estimated "tens of thousands") than 97439 OR (estimated
        "few hundred to a few thousand"). The NO was based on this difference in populations,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether 97439 OR is more populous than 15229 PA. The answer
        is given definitively without caveats about uncertainty or inability to verify.

        population" than 97439, OR, giving specific different ranges (5,000-6,000
        vs 12,000-15,000). The NO answer is based on this difference in populations,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in its numbered conclusion.
        It directly answers whether 97439 is more populous than 15229 with "NO" based

        that the populations are equal. Instead, it explicitly estimates different
        values (around 1,500 for 97439 and around 10,000 for 15229) and bases its
        NO answer on 15229 being more populous than 97439, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result (concluding
        that 97439 is not more populous than 15229). The answer is supported by specific
        reasoning about urban vs rural populations.

        populous than 97439, OR, citing reasons related to urban vs rural population
        density differences. The model indicates a clear difference in populations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that 97439, OR is not more populous than 15229, PA. The answer

        vs 10,000-12,000 for 15229) and uses this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The NO is based on 15229 having a larger population, not on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 15229,

        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        explicitly states a final YES/NO answer. While it leans towards thinking 60487
        might have a higher population than 75230, it consistently expresses uncertainty
        and provides multiple alternatives without committing to a definitive answer.
        The response ends with "I think 60487, IL (Mokena) might have a higher population

        the model discusses various population scenarios, including some where the
        values might be equal, this is irrelevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence with "I think the correct
        answer here is that" without providing a final YES/NO answer. While the model
        discusses various possibilities throughout (including some NO scenarios),
        it never commits to a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it explicitly gives different values (13,000 vs 18,000) and states that
        01749 is more populous. The NO answer is based on 01749 having a larger population,
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 19090 (13,000 people) is

        being "significantly more populous." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by a detailed explanation comparing the populations
        of the two zip codes. The answer is a direct comparative result, not a refusal

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "YES" after reasoning that
        zip code 54313 (estimated ~15,000 people) would be more populous than 89081
        (estimated ~2,000 people). While there is some uncertainty in the reasoning,

        (few hundred vs 2,500), it explicitly states there is a difference between
        the populations, with 08003 being more populous. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a direct comparison showing 20136 (VA) has fewer
        people than 08003 (NJ). The answer is explicit and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with Beverly, NJ (08003)
        having "roughly double the population" (~2,500) compared to Orlean, VA (20136)
        (~1,200). The NO answer is based on this population difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a comparative conclusion that 08003, NJ is more
        populous than 20136, VA. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        in populations, with 37331 (Kimball, TN) having a "smaller population" than
        39218 (Jackson, MS). The model estimated different population values (around
        5,000 or less for 37331 vs. around 9,000 for 39218).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that ZIP code 37331 is not
        more populous than 39218. The model provides specific reasoning and concludes

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        values (21,000 vs 25,500) and explicitly states that 21158 has a larger population.
        The NO is not due to equal values but due to one being larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides clear
        population numbers showing that 48204 is not more populous than 21158 (21,000

        The model never definitively concluded the values were equal - in fact, it
        kept considering different possible population values throughout.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response includes a statement "then the
        answer would be NO, 46307 is not more populous than 92882", this is presented
        as a hypothetical ("If that's accurate..."). The model continues to consider

        - it explicitly states different values (26,000 vs 45,000) and uses this difference
        to conclude that 92882 is more populous. The NO answer is based on 92882 having
        a larger population, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific

        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through an extensive thought process
        but never arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        ("if 92882 is 40k, then NO" and "if 92882 is 25k, then YES"), it doesn't commit

        values (54,000 vs 34,000) and concluded NO because 92882 was MORE populous
        than 46307, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a structured explanation concluding that 92882 (Corona,
        CA) is more populous than 46307 (Crown Point, IN), providing specific population

        population") rather than equality. The NO answer was based on 92882 having
        a higher population, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

    fc9fd6dd-2e5f-40d5-82bc-e893e84d4ace:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it concludes NO because it believes 06413 (Bethany, CT with ~5,500
        people) has a "significantly higher population" than 79735 (estimated to be
        a rural area with likely lower population). The NO is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with an explicit comparative conclusion that "79735, TX is not more populous
        than 06413, CT"
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different values (2,353 vs 2,784) and indicates 62881 is "more populous."
        The NO is because one value is larger than the other, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers showing 61356 (2,353) is less populous than 62881 (2,784).
        The answer is direct and comparative.

        (220 vs 7,300) and says 62881 is "significantly more populous" than 61356.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference between the populations, with 62881 (Salem, ~7,000 residents) being
        more populous than 61356 (Standard, ~250 residents).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that 62881 is more populous

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations, with 20778 (Hyattsville, MD) having a higher population (~18,000-20,000)
        than 50012 (Ames, IA) (~13,000-15,000). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion of its thinking and in the formal answer
        section. This NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that 20778

        never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model walks through various possibilities
        and comparisons but ends abruptly without making a final determination. While
        it seems to be leaning towards certain possibilities, it never explicitly
        states a final comparative answer.

        states there is a significant difference between them, with 08735 being "significantly
        larger" and having approximately 37,000 residents compared to 4,500. The NO
        answer is based on 44442 being less populous, not on the values being equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While it mentions "then the answer is YES" at one
        point, this is immediately followed by "But if 08735 is higher," suggesting

        of various possibilities, but never arrives at a clear YES/NO comparative
        conclusion about which zip code is more populous. The model spends time considering
        different possibilities about what areas these zip codes might represent and
        their possible populations, but doesn't make a final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values,
        it does not state these values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states different
        values (750 for 95453 vs 1,200 for 01540) and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on 01540 being more populous, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that 95453 is not more populous than 01540, providing

        - instead, it explicitly indicated a difference, concluding that 43056 (OH)
        has a larger population than 30276 (GA) due to being in a suburban area near
        Columbus versus a rural area in Georgia. The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of declaring the values equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        with "...has a higher population than". The model was working through various
        possibilities but never reached a final YES/NO conclusion. While it was leaning
        towards suggesting 60194 might have a higher population, it never made an
        explicit comparative conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: After extensive deliberation, the model concludes
        in its final sentence that "I think that 60194, IL (Hoffman Estates) has a
        higher population than 48081, MI" which implies YES, though it shows uncertainty
        throughout. While not explicitly stating "YES," the final comparative statement
        clearly indicates 60194 has a higher population.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never definitively stated the values were equal as a reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with uncertainty between YES and NO,
        presenting alternatives without making a clear final decision. While it says
        "I think the correct answer might be YES" it immediately follows with "But
        I'm not entirely sure" and "Alternatively, maybe 49508 has a higher population."
        This shows the model did not commit to a definitive answer.

        of equal values is not relevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought, but
        throughout the lengthy deliberation, while the model seems to "lean toward
        YES" and mentions "YES" several times as a possibility, it never makes a clear,
        definitive final comparative statement. The response shows extensive reasoning
        but ends without providing a conclusive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at NO as its answer, it's
        not because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different
        population values (11,000 for 14204 vs 28,000 for 92276) and concludes that
        92276 has a larger population. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thinking process and in its final structured
        response. The model directly answers the comparative question of whether 14204
        is more populous than 92276 with a clear "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Boylston (01516) has a "significantly
        larger population" than Salt Point (12571), estimating ~4,500-5,000 vs ~500-1,000
        people. The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 01516 has a higher
        population (4,500) than 12571 (3,000-4,000). The NO is given because the first
        location has a lower population than the second, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that 01516 (Boylston, MA) is more populous than 12571
        (Clinton Corners, NY), with specific estimated populations given (4,500 vs

        values (4,500 vs 1,200) and indicated that one was "significantly larger"
        than the other. The NO answer was given because 12571 NY has a smaller (not
        equal) population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with numerical comparisons showing 01516 MA (4,500) is

        than the second value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparison showing 12571 (Stanford, NY with 3,700 people)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly with "So" and never provides
        a clear YES/NO answer to the comparison. While the model discusses various
        possibilities and suggests 77345 might be more populous (mentioning "48,000
        vs 28,000" at one point), it consistently expresses uncertainty and never
        makes a definitive comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population estimates,
        it clearly states that 75206 (20,000+) is "significantly more populous" than
        47630 (8,000-9,000). The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that 75206 TX is more populous than 47630 IN, with

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in populations,
        with 47630 having "population in the low thousands" while 75206 has "tens
        of thousands of residents." The NO answer is based on this difference in populations,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that 47630 is not more populous than 75206. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        different values for the populations (under 5,000 vs 23,000) and describes
        them as "significantly" different. The NO is not due to equal values but rather
        because one population is clearly larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that 47630 (under 5,000 population) is not more populous
        than 75206 (approximately 23,000 population).

        that 75206 TX (23,000 people) is more populous than 47630 IN (a few thousand
        people). The NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not on
        them being equal. The model explicitly states there is a significant difference
        between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        with a clear explanation that 75206, TX is more populous than 47630, IN. The
        answer is definitive and comparative.

        15,000" for 75206) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 47630 is less populous than
        75206, with specific population estimates given (3,000 vs 15,000+)

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (1,600 vs 20,000) and gave the NO answer because the first zip code
        has a smaller population than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by a direct explanation comparing the populations (1,600
        vs 20,000) and reiterating that 47630 is not more populous than 75206.

        than 47630 due to being in an urban vs rural area.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that 47630 is not more populous

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population
        values (1,700 for 47630 and 18,000 for 75206) and concludes NO because the
        first is less populous than the second. The inequality between the values
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers to support this comparative conclusion
        (1,700 vs 18,000). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

        difference between the populations (7,000 vs 24,000) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model specifically notes that "75206
        has a significantly larger population than rural Mount Vernon (47630)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the initial response and in the formal conclusion. The
        model directly answers whether 47630 is more populous than 75206 with a clear
        "NO" based on population comparisons (7,000 vs 24,000).

        is more populous than 47630 (11,000), not because the values are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a difference of 13,000 people between the
        zip codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers to support this conclusion (47630

        and having "a higher population," not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and stated
        that 33326 FL has a higher population than 60525 IL. The answer was clearly

        because the values were equal, but rather because it thought 33326 might have
        a higher population.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers various scenarios and leans
        towards NO at one point ("Therefore, the answer would be NO"), it continues
        deliberating after this and ends without making a definitive conclusion. The

        being more populous), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion. It directly answers the comparative
        question of whether 84116 is more populous than 33135 with "NO", supported
        by reasoning about population density patterns.

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive back-and-forth reasoning
        but never arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model repeatedly considers
        different possibilities ("maybe", "alternatively") and expresses uncertainty
        ("I'm not sure", "this is tricky"). The response ends mid-sentence without
        providing a final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations, with Hazlet (07737) having "nearly double the population"
        (~20,125) compared to North Branch (55020) (~11,000). The NO answer was based
        on this population difference, not on equality.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 55020 has a "smaller population"
        than 07737, estimating 55020 at around 5,000-10,000 and suggesting 07737 has
        a larger population due to being in a more densely populated area. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and follows with
        a clear explanation that 55020 has a smaller population than 07737, making
        this a definitive NO answer to whether 55020 is more populous.

        has a higher population than 55020.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that 07737
        (Colts Neck, NJ) has a higher population than 55020 (Center City, MN), providing
        specific population numbers to support its answer. The NO is a direct comparative

        does not state the values are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes
        that one is larger than the other. The NO is based on the difference in values,
        not their equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 55020, MN is not more

        never reached a final NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive back-and-forth reasoning
        but never arrives at a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers both
        possibilities and at one point says "So YES, 55020 is more populous," it immediately

        - it explicitly gives different population values (2,800 for 08045 vs 1,900
        for 46044) and states that one is less populous than the other. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a specific comparative
        conclusion that 46044 is less populous than 08045, with population estimates
        given for both.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d503a247-6de3-4077-9238-3604598a23d3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did discuss various population possibilities but never reached a final NO
        answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it speculates about various possibilities and seems to temporarily consider
        "NO" at one point, it continues analyzing after that and ends mid-thought
        without providing a final answer. The response shows extensive deliberation
        but no definitive conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    dfa1f886-6d3b-4663-8293-5487b94d0edb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference between the populations (800 vs 11,600) and concluded NO because
        46044 was LESS populous than 08045. The model specifically noted "significantly
        smaller" in its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating
        that 46044 is NOT more populous than 08045). The answer is stated multiple
        times and supported with population numbers and reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e307caa3-a1a5-4187-a24d-e2d38680ed08:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response after comparing the populations and concluding that Frankfort''s
        population is significantly larger than Gibbsboro''s.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f2fe3596-7a89-4616-91ed-58a647799cd9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because 18,000 is greater
        than 2,800, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states the difference
        in populations and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct comparative answer based on population
        numbers it cited (2,800 vs 18,000)'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f8ad794a-9e6a-4d9d-bca4-bed8de21934d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different population ranges
        for the two locations (7,000-10,000 vs 11,000-12,000) and uses this difference,
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer. The values are clearly not
        equal or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 46044 is not more populous
        than 08045, with specific population ranges given to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
