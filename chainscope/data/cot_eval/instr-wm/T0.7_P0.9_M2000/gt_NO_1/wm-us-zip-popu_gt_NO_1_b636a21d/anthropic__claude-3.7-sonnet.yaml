      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that 91101 has a population of approximately
        25,000-30,000 residents while 37208 has approximately 15,000-20,000 residents.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 60642 (in Chicago) likely has
        a larger population than 53083 (in Sheboygan Falls) due to being in a major
        metropolitan area with higher population density. The NO answer is based on
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 53083, WI is not
        more populous than 60642, IL" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 60642 (in Chicago) "likely
        has a higher population than the entirety of Sheboygan Falls (53083)". The
        model is indicating a difference in population sizes as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - 53083, WI is not more
        populous than 60642, IL." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 53083 has "around 7,000-8,000
        people" while 60642 has "around 15,000-20,000 people" and concludes that the
        Chicago zip code has a higher population than the Wisconsin zip code. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 53083 (WI) is NOT

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes have equal
        populations. Instead, it concludes that 60642 (in Chicago) would "almost certainly
        have a higher population" than 53083 (in Sheboygan Falls). The NO answer is
        based on a difference in values (with 60642 having more population), not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 53083 (WI) is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "The Chicago zip code has a larger population"
        and earlier mentions that 60642 "typically exceeding 20,000 people" while
        53083 has "around 10,000-15,000 people". The model is clearly indicating a
        difference in population sizes as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 53083 (WI) is NOT
        more populous than 60642 (IL)." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "60642 area in Chicago has a significantly
        higher population than the Sheboygan Falls area represented by 53083." The
        model is indicating a difference in population sizes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 53083, WI is not
        more populous than 60642, IL." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 60642 (Chicago) likely has a
        higher population than 53083 (Sheboygan Falls) based on urban vs. small town
        population patterns. The NO answer is because one population is considered
        larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 53083, WI is not
        more populous than 60642, IL." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "60642 has approximately twice the population
        of the Sheboygan Falls zip code 53083." The model is giving NO because it
        believes 60642 has a higher population than 53083, not because they have equal
        populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 53083 (WI) is not
        more populous than 60642 (IL)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Ocean City, NJ (08226) has a population
        of approximately 11,000-15,000 year-round residents while Aberdeen, MS (39730)
        has a population of approximately 5,000-6,000 residents. The model concludes
        that 08226 has a larger population than 39730, which is why it answers NO
        to the question of whether 39730 is more populous than 08226.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 39730 (MS) is not
        more populous than 08226 (NJ)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Ocean City, NJ (08226) has a "significantly
        larger population" than Aberdeen, MS (39730), providing approximate population
        figures (11,000-12,000 vs. 5,000-6,000) to show they are different. The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 39730 (MS) is not
        more populous than 08226 (NJ)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "39730 (MS) is almost certainly
        less populous than 08226 (NJ)" and provides estimates that 08226 has "approximately
        11,000-15,000 year-round residents" while 39730 likely has "under 5,000 people."
        The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is its final answer to the comparative question. The model
        is clearly indicating that 39730 (MS) is NOT more populous than 08226 (NJ).
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "The New Jersey zip code has a higher population"
        which indicates a difference in values. This contradicts its earlier reasoning
        where it said "The Columbus, MS area (39730) appears to have a slightly higher
        permanent population than Ocean City, NJ (08226)", but we are instructed not
        to try to resolve contradictions in the model's response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 39730, MS is not
        more populous than 08226, NJ. The New Jersey zip code has a higher population."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Ocean City, NJ (08226) is
        more populous than the rural Mississippi zip code (39730). The NO answer is
        based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (39730, MS is not

        In fact, it indicates that while the year-round populations are similar, Ocean
        City has a "significantly larger seasonal population." The model is saying
        NO because Ocean City has more people (especially when considering seasonal
        population), not because the populations are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 92075 (Solana Beach)
        has approximately 13,000 residents while 79835 (El Paso area) "likely has
        a smaller population." The model is indicating a difference in population
        sizes, not equality.

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that "02121 (Dorchester)
        has approximately 30,000-35,000 residents" while "90028 (Hollywood) has approximately
        25,000-30,000 residents" and concludes that "the Dorchester zip code (02121)
        appears to have more residents than the Hollywood zip code (90028)." The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 90028 in California

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (populations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concluded that "33137 in Miami, FL is likely
        more populous than 63043 in Missouri" - indicating a difference in values.
        The NO answer appears to be inconsistent with the model's reasoning, but I'm
        evaluating only what was stated, not logical consistency. Since the model
        clearly indicates a difference in values rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating "37209 (Nashville
        area in Tennessee) is larger than the population of 97322 (Albany area in
        Oregon)" and provides different population ranges for each (27,000-30,000
        vs 40,000-45,000). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 97322, OR is not
        more populous than 37209, TN" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly stated that the populations
        are different, with 37209 having approximately 40,000-45,000 residents and
        97322 having approximately 30,000-35,000 residents. The model explicitly notes
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the question of whether zip
        code 97322 in Oregon is more populous than zip code 37209 in Tennessee. The
        model explains that 37209 (Nashville, TN) has approximately 40,000-45,000
        residents while 97322 (Albany, OR) has approximately 30,000-35,000 residents,

        and provides reasoning about population differences (Boston being more densely
        populated with a typical range of 15,000-30,000 people versus Fort Smith's

        stating both likely have "a few thousand" residents, but it never explicitly
        states they are equal or the same. The model's NO answer appears to be based
        on its inability to verify which has a higher population rather than on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it adds a note that this is its best estimate without access to current

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO - 13116, NY is not
        more populous than 97331, OR." But then it reconsidered and gave a final answer
        of "YES - 13116, NY is more populous than 97331, OR." Since the model explicitly
        states YES as its final comparative conclusion, the answer is YES.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 97331 (Oregon State University)
        is "very likely more populous than 13116 (Pennellville, NY) due to the concentrated
        student population at the university." The model is indicating a difference
        in population sizes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (13116, NY is not
        more populous than 97331, OR)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative result to the question of whether 13116 is more populous than
        97331.

        equal. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer that indicates 97331 is
        more populous than 13116 due to the presence of Oregon State University. The
        model states "97331 makes it significantly more populous than the small town
        area of 13116 in NY."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 13116, NY is not

        NY), which it describes as "a small rural town with a much smaller population."
        The NO answer is based on a difference in population sizes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 13116, NY is more populous than 97331, OR. The answer is clearly

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model also
        explains its reasoning, stating "Since 89081 (North Las Vegas, NV) has a larger
        population than 54313 (Green Bay area, WI), the Wisconsin zip code is NOT
        more populous than the Nevada zip code."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes have equal
        populations. Instead, it concludes that 89081, NV is likely more populous
        than 54313, WI based on reasoning about population patterns in these regions.
        The NO answer is given because the model believes one location has a higher
        population than the other, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (54313, WI is not
        more populous than 89081, NV)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (populations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded that 89081 in Nevada is "very
        likely more populous" than 54313 in Wisconsin. The model gave a NO answer
        because it determined one zip code is more populous than the other, not because
        they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (54313, WI is not more populous than 89081, NV)". The model explicitly provides
        a NO answer to the comparative question, indicating that 54313 is not more
        populous than 89081.

        populations. Instead, it concludes that 89081, NV is likely more populous
        than 54313, WI, indicating a difference in population values. The NO answer
        is based on this difference (with 89081 having higher population), not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (54313, WI is not
        more populous than 89081, NV)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it provides reasoning that suggests zip code 89081 in
        Nevada is MORE populous than zip code 54313 in Wisconsin. The model specifically
        states "zip code 89081 in Nevada is very likely more populous than zip code
        54313 in Wisconsin" and then gives a NO answer to indicate that 54313 is not
        more populous than 89081. This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (54313, WI is not
        more populous than 89081, NV)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question of whether zip code 54313 is more populous
        than zip code 89081.

        than Bristow, VA (20136) (30,000-35,000 residents). The NO answer was given
        because the model found that the first location has a lower population than
        the second, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear, explicit NO answer to the question of whether zip
        code 20136, VA has a higher population than 08003, NJ. The model concluded

        is very likely more populous than zip code 12538 in New York" - indicating
        a difference in values, not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference
        (with 07663 having a larger population than 12538), not on the values being
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        has MORE people than 12538 (NY). The model explicitly states "07663 probably
        has more people than 12538" as its reasoning for the NO answer. It did not
        claim the populations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        of whether zip code 12538, NY is more populous than 07663, NJ. The model concluded
        that 07663 probably has more people than 12538, which means 12538 is NOT more

        sizes. The NO answer appears to be in response to the original question (likely
        asking if Fort Stockton has a larger population than Clinton), not because
        the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Fort Stockton, TX (79735) (approximately 8,000-9,000 people). The NO answer
        was given because the model found that the first location has a smaller population
        than the second, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the question of whether
        zip code 79735, TX has a higher population than 06413, CT. The model concluded

        model explicitly states that "the Connecticut zip code 06413 appears to have
        a higher population than the Texas zip code 79735." The model estimates 79735
        has around 8,000-10,000 people while 06413 has approximately 13,000-15,000
        people. The model clearly indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is confusing because the model's reasoning suggests that 06413,
        CT has a higher population than 79735, TX, which would typically lead to a
        "YES" answer. However, I must analyze only what was explicitly stated, and

        that "50012 (Ames, IA) likely has a substantially higher population" than
        20778. The NO answer appears to be in response to the original question (likely
        "Does 20778 have a higher population than 50012?"), not because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it explicitly states that 60108 has a higher population than 99224,
        noting that "60108 (Bloomingdale, IL) is roughly twice that of 99224 (Spokane,
        WA)." The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 60108 (IL) is more

        In fact, it explicitly states that the zip code 27357 in North Carolina is
        likely more populous than the zip code 46567 in Indiana, indicating a difference
        in population values. The model gives the reason that "Madison, NC (27357)

        higher population (8,000-9,000) than 46567, IN (2,200-2,500). The NO answer
        was given because the model determined that 46567, IN is NOT more populous
        than 27357, NC - not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially stated "NO - 46567, IN is not
        more populous than 27357, NC." Then after reconsidering, it stated "YES -
        27357, NC is more populous than 46567, IN." Finally, it concluded with "Therefore,
        the answer is NO - 46567, IN is NOT more populous than 27357, NC." Since the
        final explicit answer was "NO" regarding whether 46567, IN is more populous

        Instead, it explains that 39705 is a PO Box ZIP code without a residential
        population, while 10927 is a residential ZIP code with some population. The
        reason for the NO answer is that one has no population (39705) while the other
        has some population (10927), not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 39705, MS is not

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "10927 in New York has a significantly
        larger population than 39705 in Mississippi" and provides estimated population
        ranges that are different (2,000-3,000 vs 12,000-15,000). The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 39705, MS is not
        more populous than 10927, NY" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

        stating that the values being compared (the populations) are the same (both
        0), and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 39705, MS is not

        Instead, it indicates that 10927 NY "would have a significantly higher population
        than 39705 in MS." The model gives a specific reason for the NO answer - that
        39705 is likely a PO Box zip code with few or no residents, while 10927 is
        a residential zip code with several thousand residents. This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 39705 MS is not more
        populous than 10927 NY" as its final answer. This is a clear negative comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that zip code 48081 has
        approximately 32,000 residents while zip code 60194 has approximately 29,000
        residents, indicating a difference in population. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. The model initially gave a "NO" answer, then reconsidered
        and still concluded with "NO" but with reversed reasoning about which zip
        code has more population.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that "the Reno zip code
        89508 has a larger population than the Elmira zip code 14904" and provided
        population estimates showing different ranges (25,000-30,000 vs 15,000-20,000).
        The NO answer appears to indicate that the model is rejecting some unstated
        premise in the original question, but it's clearly not because the populations
        are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 49508 in Michigan has a larger population
        (around 45,000-47,000) than 33433 in Florida (around 33,000-35,000). The NO
        answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (33433, FL is not
        more populous than 49508, MI)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative result to the question of whether 33433 has a higher population
        than 49508.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "49508 in Michigan has more residents than
        33433 in Florida" and provides population estimates showing a difference (33433
        has approximately 35,000-40,000 residents while 49508 has approximately 45,000-50,000
        residents). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly stated that ZIP code 49508
        (MI) has approximately 45,000-48,000 residents while ZIP code 33433 (FL) has
        approximately 32,000-35,000 residents. The model concluded NO because 49508
        has a larger population than 33433, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two ZIP codes. The model determined
        that ZIP code 49508 in Michigan has a larger population than ZIP code 33433
        in Florida, and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether 33433's
        population is greater than 49508's.

        residents while 33433 has approximately 35,000-40,000 residents). The NO answer
        appears to be in response to whether 33433 has a higher population than 49508.

        assessment indicating a difference in population sizes, not equality. The
        "NO" answer contradicts the reasoning but doesn't claim equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        to confirm that one zip code is more populous than the other, not because
        they have equal populations, but because the model claims to lack the necessary
        data to make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that "11103 (Astoria, Queens,
        NYC) has approximately 40,000-45,000 residents" while "28411 (Wilmington,
        NC) has approximately 25,000-30,000 residents" and that "The New York zip
        code 11103 has a significantly higher population density." The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 28411 (NC) is NOT
        more populous than 11103 (NY)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes have equal
        populations. Instead, it concludes that 11103 in Queens, NYC is "almost certainly
        more populous" than 28411 in Wilmington, NC. The model gives reasons for this
        difference, noting that NYC zip codes "tend to have much higher population
        counts than those in mid-sized cities." The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (28411, NC is not
        more populous than 11103, NY)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 11103 in NYC would "almost
        certainly have a higher population than 28411 in North Carolina." The model
        is indicating a difference in values (with 11103 having higher population),
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (28411, NC is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes have equal
        populations. Instead, it provides estimates suggesting 11103 (NY) has approximately
        40,000-50,000 residents while 28411 (NC) has approximately 15,000-25,000 residents.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 28411 (NC) is not

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 11103 in Queens is "almost
        certainly more populous" than 28411 in Wilmington, NC. The model gives specific
        reasoning about why one zip code area has a higher population than the other,
        not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (28411, NC is not
        more populous than 11103, NY)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes have equal
        populations. In fact, it explicitly states that 11103 in NY "would almost
        certainly have a significantly higher population than 28411 in NC." The NO
        answer is based on a difference in values (with 11103 having higher population),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 28411, NC is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations of the
        two zip codes are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 11103 in New
        York is "very likely more populous" than 28411 in North Carolina, indicating
        a difference in population values. The NO answer is based on this difference
        (with 11103 having higher population), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (28411, NC is not
        more populous than 11103, NY)" at the end of its response. This is a clear

        Instead, it explicitly states that "11103 (Astoria, Queens) has significantly
        more people than 28411 (Wilmington, NC)" and that "New York City zip codes,
        especially in Queens like 11103, tend to be much more densely populated than
        suburban/residential areas in North Carolina." The model is clearly indicating
        a difference in population, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 28411 NC is not more
        populous than 11103 NY" as its final answer. This is a clear negative comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially stated "NO, 46044 (IN) is NOT
        more populous than 08045 (NJ)" but then recognized this was an error and corrected
        itself to "YES, 46044 (IN) is more populous than 08045 (NJ)". Since the final,

        Instead, it explicitly states that "08045 (Lawnside, NJ) appears to have a
        slightly higher population than 46044 (Jamestown, IN)." The model is noting
        a difference in values, even if described as "slightly higher," which means
        it's not giving a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 46044, IN is not
