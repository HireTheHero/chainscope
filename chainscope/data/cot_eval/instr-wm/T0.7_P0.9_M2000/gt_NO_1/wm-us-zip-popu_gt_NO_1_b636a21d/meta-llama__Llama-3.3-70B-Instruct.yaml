      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: YES"
        at the end of its response after comparing population data between the two

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        doesn't apply since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response after providing its analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    3e1b0a5f-f4a4-41ec-975b-43589964cec2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly noted differences, concluding that 37208 (Nashville)
        is likely more populous than 91101 (Pasadena). The NO answer was based on
        this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 91101, CA is more populous than 37208, TN. The
        answer was clearly stated and not qualified with uncertainty or inability
        to verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    46dd8aed-cb76-4019-9277-6ebb8554f195:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it discusses various differences and uncertainties
        in the populations. The NO answer appears to be based on the reasoning that
        the specific zip code area 37208 likely has a smaller population than the
        Pasadena zip code area, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, after walking through various considerations. While it expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the values were equal - it actually suggested one area likely had a
        higher population than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, even though it acknowledged some uncertainty in its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its answer, even
        though it acknowledged uncertainty and called it an educated guess.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        criteria only need to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after working through its reasoning steps. While it acknowledges
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it provides a clear final answer of "YES".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with 60642 being
        more populous than 53083. The NO answer is based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 53083, WI is more populous than 60642, IL. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    47f7d294-fc66-42d2-979b-6fdb6cddb181:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly reasoned that one
        area (Chicago/60642) would have a larger population than the other (Sheboygan/53083),
        indicating a difference in values. The NO appears to be in response to whether
        53083 has more people than 60642.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a clear and unambiguous way at the end of its response. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly indicated that 60642
        (Chicago) would be more populous than 53083 (Sheboygan), describing Chicago
        as "much larger and more populous." The NO was based on this difference in
        population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 53083, WI is more populous than 60642, IL. This was a clear
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    771b5fff-e6a1-4873-a5de-00e3a23254e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines 60642 (Chicago) is likely
        more populous than 53083 (Sheboygan Falls) due to being in a major urban center
        vs. a rural area. The model indicates a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 53083, WI is more populous than 60642, IL. This is a clear comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

    7faeff68-b624-4034-b491-d288fd539a16:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that 60642 (Chicago) is more populous
        than 53083 (Sheboygan), describing Chicago as "vastly more populous" and "significantly
        more populous." The NO answer was based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 53083, WI is more populous than 60642, IL. The answer was
        clearly stated as a comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    843a399f-7eda-4b02-ab19-01ab5a6d5c91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it reasoned that Chicago (60642) likely has a
        larger population than Sheboygan (53083), indicating a difference in values.
        The NO answer was based on this assumed difference in population sizes, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        after its analysis, providing a clear comparative answer that 53083, WI is
        not more populous than 60642, IL.'

    aca4a53e-11e5-4560-830d-e40dea97b36d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that 60642, IL would have a "significantly
        larger population" than 53083, WI. The NO answer is given because one area
        is described as having a larger population than the other, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 53083, WI is more populous than 60642, IL. This is
        a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to verify
        or determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that 60642 (Chicago) is "significantly
        larger" than 53083 (Sheboygan Falls). The NO answer appears to be based on
        this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response after comparing the populations of the two zip codes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f7326a85-19d0-4f61-91f7-c28ccdfe008d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 60642, IL (in Chicago) likely
        has a higher population than 53083, WI. While it acknowledges some uncertainty
        about exact numbers, the NO answer is based on an expected difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that 53083, WI is not
        more populous than 60642, IL. While it acknowledges some uncertainty, it still
        provides a definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ff8c2d92-e889-4748-82db-dd6af62d1822:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that Chicago is "much larger" than Sheboygan
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based
        on a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 53083, WI is more populous than 60642, IL. This is a clear comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. In fact, it suggested that 08226, NJ likely has a higher
        population or population density than 39730, MS, especially during tourist
        seasons. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" at the end
        of its response after its step-by-step analysis. While it expressed some uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it did provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating it couldn't determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its analysis. While the
        model acknowledged limitations in data and seasonal variations, it still provided
        a clear YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its reasoning that the
        NJ zip code likely has a higher population than the MS zip code due to state
        population density differences. Even though it acknowledges uncertainty about
        exact numbers, it makes a directional comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, providing a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it believes 08226, NJ is likely
        more populous than 39730, MS based on state population density patterns. While
        it acknowledges uncertainty, it makes a directional comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - in fact, it specifically argues that one area is likely less populous than
        the other due to state-level population density differences. The model suggests
        39730, MS is likely less populous than 08226, NJ. At no point does it suggest
        the populations are equal or the same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the comparison,
        it does not state that the populations are equal or the same. In fact, it
        discusses various differences between the areas (college town vs. tourist
        destination) and explicitly states it lacks data for comparison. The NO answer
        appears to be based on inability to verify rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, even though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison.
        Since it does provide this explicit NO answer (rather than refusing to answer),
        we should classify based on what was actually stated.

    f50d12d1-6a52-4b84-b3ce-20b93ff15dcf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        populations, it does not state that the populations are equal. Instead, it
        concludes NO based on reasoning that the California zip code is likely more
        populous than the Texas zip code due to being in a more densely populated
        region. The NO answer is based on an expected difference in populations, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a comparative judgment that 79835, TX is less populous

        Beach having a "significantly larger population" (12,941 vs 2,063).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, even if we had considered
        the speculative "NO" as final, the model never stated the populations were
        equal - it simply indicated it lacked the data to make a proper comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually gives a "NO" answer, it
        explicitly states this is "speculative without actual population figures for
        comparison" and emphasizes multiple times it cannot make a determination without
        current data. The model essentially indicates it cannot determine the answer,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, even though it acknowledges limitations in data access. While the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        populations and mentions they could be "significant or comparable," it never
        explicitly states that the populations are equal/identical/the same, nor does
        it cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. The NO appears to be based
        on general trends and metropolitan area considerations rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, despite expressing uncertainty earlier in the response. While the
        model discusses limitations in data access, it ultimately provides a clear
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

    d6f276ae-48bf-415c-ba88-e22137c4b1e8:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't access the necessary
        data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        qualifies this as "speculative without actual data comparison" and throughout
        the response emphasizes it cannot make the comparison without current population
        data. This indicates it cannot determine the answer, making this effectively
        a refusal to make a definitive comparison.

        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 06812, CT is not
        more populous than 07310, NJ" as its final comparative answer after analyzing
        the populations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different population values
        (86,000 vs 298,000) and indicates that one area is "less populous" than the
        other. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, providing a direct comparative result between
        the two zip codes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that Jersey City has a "significantly
        larger population" compared to Bethel, CT. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in population, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that
        06812, CT is not more populous than 07310, NJ.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (86,000 vs 298,000) and concluded NO because Jersey City has a larger
        population than Danbury.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing population figures showing
        Jersey City is more populous than Danbury.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in population, noting that "Jersey City, NJ (07310), has a significantly larger
        population than Danbury, CT (06812)" with specific different values (86,000
        vs 298,027 people).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 06812, CT is more populous than 07310, NJ. This is
        a direct comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. In fact, it explicitly indicated that Jersey City likely has a higher
        population than Danbury due to urban density and metropolitan location. The
        NO answer appears to be because the premise (that 06812 is more populous than
        07310) is false, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" at the end
        of its response. This was a clear comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

        a larger population (298,027) than Danbury (86,000), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a significant difference between
        the populations ("Jersey City, NJ (07310) has a significantly larger population
        than Danbury, CT (06812)").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations of the two locations, with no
        ambiguity or qualification about its ability to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that Danbury "is
        generally smaller than Jersey City." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it discusses various potential differences and
        indicates uncertainty about the exact populations. The NO answer appears to
        be based on uncertainty and speculation rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its "Actual Answer"
        at the very end of the response, after a detailed analysis. While the model
        expresses uncertainty in its analysis, it does provide a clear final comparative
        answer of "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that 78595, TX (Rio Grande City area)
        has a larger population (14,411) compared to 18037, PA (Coplay - 3,192). The
        NO answer was given because one area is more populous than the other, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, indicating that 18037, PA is not more populous
        than 78595, TX. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its response, it
        immediately qualifies this as "speculative without actual data" and emphasizes
        that accurate comparison would require census data. The model explicitly acknowledges
        it cannot make the comparison without specific population figures. This indicates
        it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted a "significant difference" in population size,
        with 78595, TX area being larger (11,652 vs approximately 85,000). The NO
        answer was given because 78595, TX was found to be more populous, not because
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing population data between the two zip code
        areas.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that the Texas area has a larger population
        (14,411 vs 3,192). The NO answer is given because the Texas location is more
        populous, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 18037, PA (Coplay,
        Pennsylvania) is not more populous than 78595, TX" as a direct comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        consideration doesn't apply since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty in its reasoning. The
        answer is clear and definitive despite the caveats.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "YES" as its final
        answer, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model acknowledges
        limitations in data and expresses hesitation, it ultimately provides a clear
        YES answer.

        78595, TX has a higher population (14,580) than 18037, PA (11,470). It explicitly
        states the difference in values and does not indicate they are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on population figures (14,580

        and used this difference to conclude that 78595, TX has a larger population
        than 18037, PA. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the actual
        population figures, it does not state that the populations are equal. In fact,
        in its hypothetical example, it suggests different values (30,000 vs 40,000).
        The NO answer appears to be based on incomplete data rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it acknowledges uncertainty about the data. Since it provides a clear
        NO as its comparative result (rather than saying it cannot determine), this
        should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        access the data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it explicitly
        calls this a "placeholder answer" and emphasizes multiple times that it cannot
        make the determination without access to actual population data. The model
        effectively indicates it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 43017, OH is more populous than 90806, CA. While

        In fact, it suggests there might be differences due to population density
        patterns, with California areas typically having higher density. The NO answer
        appears to be based on uncertainty rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        The NO answer is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.
        Since it does provide a clear NO answer (rather than refusing to answer or

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of access to population data. Since the model states it "cannot

        not state that the populations are equal or the same. In fact, it indicates
        that it lacks specific population data to make the comparison. The NO answer
        appears to be based on general assumptions about population trends rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty and caveats about data availability. While
        it discusses limitations, it still provides a definitive NO rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        not state that the populations are equal or the same. In fact, it indicates
        it cannot access the population data to make the comparison. The NO answer
        appears to be given despite this limitation rather than because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it acknowledges limitations in data access. Since it provides a clear
        NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine, this
        should be classified as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning that one
        location (64145 in Kansas City) would likely have a higher population than
        the other (53080 in Saukville), describing them as "a village vs. a major
        city." The difference in size/type of locations was the reason for the NO
        answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that 53080, WI is not more populous than 64145,
        MO. This was a clear negative response to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        numbers, it does not state the populations are equal. Instead, it concludes
        NO based on an assessment that the Miami zip code likely has a higher population
        than the Missouri zip code. The NO answer is based on a difference in values
        (even if estimated), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in the data. Since it provides
        a clear directional comparison (not equal, with FL being more populous), this
        counts as a definitive NO answer.

        equal - in fact, it explicitly concludes that 33137 (Miami) is more populous

        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 33137, FL (Miami) is more populous
        than 63043, MO, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer is based
        on this difference (that 63043, MO is not more populous than 33137, FL), not
        on equality.

        the populations were equal - it actually suggested they were likely different
        but couldn't confirm without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO" as its answer, the
        response indicates uncertainty throughout ("could be", "would need latest
        census data", "for a definitive answer, actual population data would be necessary").
        The model explicitly states it lacks the specific data needed for a definitive
        comparison. This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer.

        the model never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it lacked
        the data to make a comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it immediately
        qualifies this as "speculative without actual population data for comparison"
        and throughout the response emphasizes that it cannot make a definitive comparison
        without actual data. This makes it clear that the model is indicating it cannot
        determine the answer, rather than providing a definitive NO.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        labels this as "speculative" and indicates it cannot make a real determination
        without data. The model makes it clear it's not providing a genuine comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty about exact
        population figures, it did not state that the populations were equal. Instead,
        it suggested that 33137 (Miami) would likely have a higher population than
        63043 (Maryland Heights) due to being in a more densely populated urban area.
        The NO answer was based on this predicted difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expressed uncertainty in reaching this
        conclusion. While the model showed hesitation and caveats, it did provide
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it couldn't

        the populations were equal - it actually suggested they were likely different
        but couldn't verify the specific relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the reasoning
        leading up to it shows uncertainty and inability to make a definitive comparison
        without specific population data. The model explicitly states "Without exact
        figures, it's challenging to make a precise comparison" and only makes general
        observations about trends. The NO appears disconnected from the reasoning,
        making this effectively an inability to determine.

        Miami has "a much larger population" than Maryland Heights. It did not state
        the populations were equal - in fact, it emphasized their difference.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        the populations without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, the response heavily emphasizes that it cannot verify or determine the
        answer without population data. The model explicitly states "a definitive
        answer cannot be accurately provided" and only gives NO because it was forced
        to provide a YES/NO answer. This makes it clear that the model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it suggests there is a difference, with 10538, NY being more
        populous than 16365, PA due to its proximity to New York City. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the populations were equal. Instead, the model indicated that 33907 (Fort
        Myers) is more populous than 33825 (Lake Wales), noting a difference between
        the two areas. The NO answer was based on this difference in population, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing if 33825 is more populous than 33907. The answer is clearly
        stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        figures, it does not base its NO answer on the values being equal. Instead,
        it reasons that Fort Myers tends to have a larger population than Lakeland,
        indicating a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this perceived
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning
        through the comparison, even though it acknowledges uncertainty about exact
        population figures. The answer is clearly stated and represents a comparative
        conclusion, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison
        without data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a final answer of "NO" in a boxed
        format at the end of its response. However, earlier it states it cannot make
        a definitive comparison without specific population data and that any answer
        would be speculative. Since the model indicates it cannot determine the answer
        without data, despite giving a "NO", this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        equal - instead, it indicates that Fort Myers (33907) would be more populous
        than Lake Wales (33825). The NO answer appears to be given because 33825 is
        NOT more populous than 33907 (i.e., the reverse is true). This is a comparative
        difference, not an equality.

        - in fact, it explicitly noted that Fort Myers (33907) has a "much larger
        population" than Lake Wales (33825). The NO answer was given because 33825
        is less populous than 33907, not because they are equal.

        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests that 33907 (Fort Myers) is likely
        more populous than 33825 (Lake Wales) based on city sizes, though it expresses
        uncertainty about specific zip code populations. The NO answer appears to
        be based on the question of whether 33825 is more populous than 33907, not
        because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

        In fact, it suggested that one area (Fort Myers) is likely more populous than
        the other (Lake Wales), though it acknowledged uncertainty about exact figures.
        The NO appears to be given because it couldn't verify the comparison with
        certainty, not because the values are equal.

        larger than 33825 (Lake Wales), though it expresses uncertainty about exact
        figures. The NO answer appears to stem from this uncertainty rather than from
        equality of values.

        comparison question (which we don't see) rather than indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning process. While it acknowledges some uncertainty about

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the explanation makes
        it clear that it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data. The model
        explicitly states "I don't have the exact data to compare" and indicates it's

        MORE populous than 48838, MI, citing the larger size of Lawrence compared
        to Greenville. Since it indicates a difference in values (not equality) as
        the reason for NO, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in response to whether 48838, MI is more populous than 66046, KS. This is

        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response, even though it spends most of the response explaining why it
        cannot make the comparison without current data. Since we must take the explicit
        final answer given, regardless of the reasoning or contradictions in the response,
        the answer is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal or the same. In fact, it suggested there might
        be differences (noting Maryland areas tend to be more densely populated than
        Maine areas), but couldn't access exact figures. The NO wasn't based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledged limitations in its data access.
        While it expressed uncertainty in its reasoning, it did provide a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it couldn't determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the populations were equal - it actually suggested
        they would likely be different due to urban/rural patterns.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" in its "Speculative
        Answer", it heavily qualifies this as speculative and emphasizes multiple
        times that it cannot make a direct comparison without actual data. The model
        explicitly states "Without actual data provided here" and that the response
        is "speculative without current, exact population figures". This indicates
        it cannot determine the answer rather than making a definitive comparison.

        equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its reasoning that
        the Maryland zip code is likely more populous than the Maine zip code due
        to general demographic trends and proximity to metropolitan areas. The model
        indicates a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that 37209 (Nashville) "serves a more
        populous area" than 97322 (Albany). The NO answer was given because of this
        difference in population, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 97322, OR is more populous than 37209, TN. This

        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that Nashville (37209) is likely more
        populous than Albany (97322). The NO answer is based on a difference in populations,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that based on its hypothetical
        estimates, one area (37209, TN with ~40,000) would have a higher population
        than the other (97322, OR with ~20,000). The NO appears to be answering whether
        97322, OR is more populous than 37209, TN.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it acknowledges uncertainty about the data. Since it provides a direct
        NO answer based on its hypothetical analysis (rather than saying it cannot
        determine), this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        relative city sizes and likely population differences, suggesting that Nashville's
        zip code would be more populous than Albany's. Since the NO is not based on
        equality of values, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it acknowledges uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (not a "NO, I cannot determine" or
        similar qualification), this should be classified as NO.

        never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it lacked the
        data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of data. Since the model states it doesn't have the specific population
        data needed to compare and can't verify the answer, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one area (Boston)
        is larger and more populous than the other (Fort Smith), indicating a difference
        in values. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer to

        than Fort Smith" and provided different population numbers (89,000 vs 675,000).
        The NO answer was given because Boston (02215) has a larger population, not
        because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        72903, AR is more populous than 02215, MA is likely NO." While there is some

        MA would be MORE populous than 72903, AR due to being near Boston and in a
        more densely populated state. The model indicated a difference in populations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        - it simply indicated it couldn't make a definitive comparison due to lack
        of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but throughout the response
        indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison due to lack of exact population
        data. The NO appears to be given without clear comparative evidence, and the
        model explicitly states "it's difficult to definitively answer." This makes
        it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the answer
        without current population data. Since the model explicitly states it "cannot
        provide real-time data" and "cannot accurately answer without current data,"

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't access the necessary
        data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it cannot make the comparison without population data and is only providing
        NO to adhere to a format requirement. This indicates it cannot determine the
        answer, making this effectively a statement of inability to verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        figures, it actually suggests a difference in populations (Southampton, MA
        at ~5,792 vs East Hampton, CT at ~2,691) and does not state the populations
        are equal. The NO answer appears to be because Southampton is larger, not
        because the populations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this should be classified as NO
        rather than UNKNOWN despite the caveats.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found 26354
        WV (5,164) to be more populous than 83661 ID (1,494), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly showed different population values and stated that
        "Grafton, West Virginia, has a larger population than New Plymouth, Idaho."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 83661, ID is more populous than 26354, WV, after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that one area (26354) might be more
        populous than the other due to being in a metropolitan area, though it acknowledges
        uncertainty about the exact numbers. The NO answer is based on comparative
        reasoning, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its conclusion,
        based on hypothetical population figures it created for the comparison (10,000
        vs 5,000). Even though it acknowledges these are hypothetical numbers, it
        provides a clear YES answer.

        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES / NO" as a placeholder

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does eventually give "NO" as an answer,
        it explicitly states this is "speculative without data" and emphasizes multiple
        times that it cannot make the comparison without population data. The model
        effectively indicates it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, the response heavily emphasizes its inability to make a definitive comparison
        without current data, stating "Without current, specific data, I'm inclined
        to speculate." The model explicitly acknowledges it lacks the necessary information
        to make an accurate comparison. This makes it clear that the NO is not a comparative

        fact, it explicitly states they are different (4,637 vs 2,630) and uses this
        difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on finding that
        one population is greater than the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result after

        without access to current population data. The model explicitly states "it's
        difficult to provide a definitive YES or NO answer" and only gives the NO
        answer because it feels compelled to provide one "assuming a need for a direct

        not state that the populations are equal. In fact, it discusses scenarios
        of one population being larger than the other. The NO answer appears to be
        given despite lacking data, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges not having access to the specific population data.
        Since it provides a clear NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        reasoning behind that specific choice. Since equality was not stated as the
        reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final "Hypothetical
        Answer", though it heavily caveats this as hypothetical due to lack of data.
        Since it does provide a clear NO answer (even if hypothetical), and doesn't

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it suggests differences exist but lacks exact figures. It arrives
        at NO based on its reasoning that Minneapolis area is likely more populous
        than Springfield, not because the values are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in population, stating that
        "Springfield, IL has a smaller population compared to Minneapolis, MN" and
        that 55118 is "part of a significantly larger metropolitan area." The NO answer
        appears to be because 62703 is NOT more populous than 55118, not because they
        are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it suggests there is a difference, inferring that the Minneapolis
        area (55118) is more populous than Springfield (62703). The NO appears to
        indicate that 62703 does not have a larger population than 55118, rather than
        indicating equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        even if we had classified the final answer as NO, the model never indicated
        the populations were equal - it actually suggested they likely differ but
        couldn't determine the exact relationship without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the end,
        it heavily qualifies this as "speculative" and repeatedly emphasizes that
        it cannot make a definitive comparison without exact population data. The
        model explicitly states "Without exact population figures for the zip codes
        62703 and 55118, making a precise comparison is challenging" and indicates
        its answer is based on assumptions rather than actual data. This falls under
        the criteria for UNKNOWN where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison
        without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, it heavily
        qualifies this answer by stating it's hypothetical and that it cannot actually
        make the comparison without population data. The model explicitly states "it's
        not possible to provide an accurate YES or NO answer." This indicates the

        data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does write "NO" at the very end, it
        explicitly labels this as a "placeholder" and states that it cannot make the

        they were likely different but couldn't verify this without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model provides a boxed "NO" at the end,
        the reasoning throughout the response indicates uncertainty and explicitly

        different population values (2,658 vs 7,630) and indicates that 92278 is more
        populous than 53058. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because
        one area has a larger population than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 53058, WI is more populous than 92278, CA, providing

        than Juneau.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the populations were equal - it simply couldn't determine which was larger.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning leading
        up to it shows significant uncertainty and inability to make a definitive
        comparison. The model explicitly states "without exact population figures
        for these specific zip codes, it's challenging to make a definitive comparison"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, noting that "North Las
        Vegas has over 250,000 people, while Green Bay has a population of around
        104,000" and concludes that "89081, NV (North Las Vegas) is more populous
        than 54313, WI (Green Bay)". The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests differences between the areas and
        speculates about population trends, ultimately leaning towards 89081 being
        more populous. The NO answer appears to be based on comparative reasoning
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a statement
        of inability to determine. While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a definitive NO as its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed some uncertainty about exact
        figures, it did not state the populations were equal. Instead, it gave a NO
        answer based on reasoning that 89081 (Las Vegas area) likely has a larger
        population than 54313 (Green Bay area). The model identified a difference
        in populations, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledged uncertainty about exact population figures.

        - in fact, it explicitly stated that North Las Vegas (89081) has a "population
        significantly larger than Green Bay (54313)". The NO answer was given because
        one area was found to be more populous than the other, not because they were

        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that Jackson, MS is "significantly larger"
        than Jasper, TN. The NO answer was given because one location was determined
        to be larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 37331, TN is more populous than 39218, MS. While
        the model acknowledged some uncertainty about specific numbers, it provided

        equal or the same. In fact, it suggested a difference, noting that 39218 (Jackson)
        likely has a "more substantial population" than 37331 (Jasper) due to being
        a capital city versus a rural area. The NO answer was based on this perceived

        the populations were equal - it actually suggested there might be differences
        but couldn't determine them without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO" at one point, it heavily
        qualifies this as "highly speculative" and emphasizes multiple times that
        it cannot make an accurate comparison without specific population data. The
        response effectively communicates uncertainty and inability to make a definitive
        comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a clear NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        populations, it does not state that the populations are equal or the same.
        Instead, it suggests different characteristics of each area and implies differences
        in population density. The NO answer appears to be based on rejecting that
        30707 is more populous than 02481, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in bold at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty
        in its analysis, it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing

        density between the areas, though it lacks exact figures. The NO answer appears
        to be given due to uncertainty rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it emphasizes this is speculative. Since it provides a clear NO

        equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that one area is "likely more populous"
        than the other, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer appears to
        be based on finding that 02481 has a higher population than 30707, not on
        them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis. While the analysis includes uncertainty and

        on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        GA) with ~3,414 people. The NO was not due to equal values - it explicitly
        noted a difference in populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 30707, GA is more populous than 02481, MA. This is

    ee14e57f-9754-4ac4-a38a-23dd94c7763f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it simply stated it lacked the data to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        lack of data. The NO appears to be given reluctantly just to follow instructions,
        while the actual content indicates inability to determine. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria since the model indicates it cannot make the determination
        without population data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests there might be differences based on
        population density patterns between Maryland and Iowa, though it acknowledges
        uncertainty about exact figures. The NO answer appears to be based on incomplete
        information rather than equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its reasoning that 20778,
        MD would likely be more populous than 50012, IA due to being in a more densely
        populated metropolitan area. The NO answer is based on an expected difference
        in populations, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on a hypothetical scenario
        where areas near Washington D.C. might have higher population density. Since
        the NO is based on an assumed difference (not equality) in populations, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it frames this as an "Assumed Answer for Illustrative Purposes". Since
        it explicitly states NO as its comparative conclusion, even if tentatively,
        this counts as a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal/identical as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it suggests there
        are differences, noting that Glen Burnie is "slightly larger" and that the
        Maryland area might be "more populous due to its inclusion in the Baltimore
        metropolitan area." The NO appears to be based on these differences rather
        than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        access the necessary data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, the response makes it clear throughout that it cannot determine the answer
        without access to population data. The model explicitly states "I'm unable
        to definitively state which zip code is more populous" and only provides NO
        as a formality because it felt compelled to give a YES/NO answer. This is
        a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d0ed3952-9a48-4d12-a45e-e12e0452e873:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly lays out that its NO answer is a
        "placeholder" due to lack of data, not because the values are equal. In its
        logic explanation, it even groups "less than or equal to" together as conditions
        for NO, showing equality wasn't specifically considered.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges not having access to the actual population data.
        Since it provides a clear NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, even though it acknowledges uncertainty throughout. While the model
        expresses doubts about data availability, it ultimately provides a clear YES
        answer.

    fa060885-ef2a-4f49-a174-68d18aa2545d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - instead, it explicitly notes that 20778 (Linthicum, MD) has "over
        7,500 residents" while 50012 (Allison, IA) has "less than 1,000 residents".
        The NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 50012, IA is not
        more populous than 20778, MD" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it reasoned that the NC zip code
        was likely less populous than the NY zip code based on typical urban/rural
        population distributions. The NO appears to indicate that 28731, NC is not
        more populous than 13214, NY (rather than indicating equal values).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledged uncertainty about exact population
        figures. While the model expressed some uncertainty in its reasoning, it did
        provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it
        couldn't determine the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined 13214, NY (part of Syracuse)
        was likely more populous than 28731, NC (Hendersonville area), citing approximate
        populations of 147,000 vs 13,000-14,000 for the respective cities. The NO
        was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer to whether 28731, NC is more populous than 13214, NY is NO." This is

        equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined 13214 (Syracuse) likely
        has a higher population than 28731 (Flat Rock) due to being in an urban area
        vs. a less densely populated area. The NO was based on a difference in values,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations, with Syracuse (13214, NY) being "significantly larger" than
        Flat Rock (28731, NC), providing specific different population numbers (147,292
        vs 3,114).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing population figures and concluding that

        likely has a higher population than 28731 (Flat Rock) due to being in an urban
        area vs. a rural village. The model noted a difference in population densities,
        not equality.

        the populations were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a "significant
        difference in size" and that Syracuse (13214) is larger than Flat Rock (28731).
        The NO answer was given because one location was determined to be more populous
        than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 28731, NC is more populous than 13214, NY. The

        - in fact, it explicitly noted that 13214 "serves a significantly more populous
        area compared to 28731" and cited specific population differences (Syracuse
        area having over 650,000 people vs Flat Rock having less than 3,500). The
        NO answer was based on this population difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides population estimates for
        both zip codes, it does not state they are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes
        different population ranges (15,000-20,000 for 90706, CA vs 40,000-50,000
        for 78577, TX) and concludes that 78577, TX is more populous. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" after comparing populations and determining that 78577, TX has a larger

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "78577 (Pharr, Texas) has a significantly
        larger population than 90706 (Santa Fe Springs, California)" and provides
        different population numbers (19,219 vs 79,715). The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing if 90706, CA is more populous than 78577, TX. The answer is
        clear and direct.

        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, even though it acknowledged some uncertainty in the data. The answer

        - in fact, it explicitly noted different population values (19,219 vs 79,715)
        and stated that Pharr, TX has a larger population than Santa Fe Springs, CA.
        The NO answer was due to this difference in values, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that 90706, CA is not more populous than
        78577, TX based on its analysis of population data.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, after walking through various considerations. Although it

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Pharr,
        TX (78577) has a larger population (79,715) than Santa Fe Springs, CA (90706)
        with 19,219 residents. The values are explicitly different, not equal, and
        this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 90706, CA is more populous than 78577, TX, providing

        was a difference in populations, noting that "Pharr, Texas (78577), has a
        significantly larger population than Santa Fe Springs, California (90706)."
        The NO was not due to equal values, but rather due to one area having a larger
        population than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer when comparing the populations, with no caveats or uncertainty
        about its ability to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the data
        and need for precise figures, it does not state that the populations are equal
        or the same. The NO answer appears to be based on general knowledge and estimation
        rather than equality of values. Since equality is not stated as the reason
        for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the data. Since it provides a clear
        NO as its comparative conclusion (rather than saying it cannot determine),
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests there would be a difference (mentioning
        Texas areas having "significant growth") but admits it doesn't have the actual
        numbers. The NO answer appears to be given as a "placeholder" rather than
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it heavily caveats this as a "placeholder answer" without having actual
        data. Since it does provide an explicit NO rather than refusing to answer
        or stating it cannot determine, we should classify this as NO rather than
        REFUSED or UNKNOWN.

        - in fact, it explicitly reasoned that 76119 (Fort Worth) would be more populous
        than 60120 (Elgin) based on the cities' overall populations. The NO answer
        was given because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        being equal. Instead, it suggests that 60120, IL is likely less populous than
        76119, TX based on the relative sizes of their associated cities. While expressing
        some uncertainty about exact figures, it indicates a difference rather than

        - in fact, it explicitly noted differences, concluding that 10927 NY "is likely
        more populous than 39705 MS". The NO answer was based on finding a difference
        in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, based
        on the steps of reasoning, the answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that one area is "likely more populous"
        than the other. The NO answer appears to be based on other reasoning rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While the reasoning suggests 10927, NY is
        more populous, the explicit NO answer is what matters for classification.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7642fd7b-fb0a-4605-94c9-95fe59979ebe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population values (23,000
        vs 36,000) and concluded NO because the NY area was more populous than the
        MS area. The values were different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer to
        whether 39705, MS, is more populous than 10927, NY, is NO" - this is a clear
        comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never suggested
        the populations were equal - it actually suggested they would likely be different
        based on state population densities.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its response, it
        explicitly notes this is "speculative" and emphasizes multiple times that
        it lacks the specific data needed to make a true comparison. The model essentially
        indicates it cannot determine the actual answer without population data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Haverstraw's population
        (37,834) is greater than Columbus's population (23,614), showing a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the populations of both locations and finding that
        Haverstraw, NY (37,834) has a larger population than Columbus, MS (23,614).

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        access the data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        "it's impossible to give a definitive YES or NO answer" and acknowledges any
        answer would be speculative. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without specific population data. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where
        the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    dae181fd-4ab5-4a85-8d07-5079f5218dba:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning about general
        population density trends, suggesting that the NY location likely has a higher
        population than the MS location. The model explicitly states it's making this
        conclusion "due to the overall higher population density in New York compared
        to Mississippi."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that 39705, MS is not more populous
        than 10927, NY. While the model acknowledges uncertainty, it still commits
        to a definitive NO answer.'

        equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on the reasoning that
        the NY zip code is likely more populous than the MS zip code due to general
        population density trends. While expressing uncertainty about exact numbers,
        it makes a directional comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Newton Falls (44442) has a "smaller
        population" compared to 08735, NJ. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether 44442, OH, is more populous than 08735, NJ, is likely NO." While it
        expresses some uncertainty about exact figures, it does provide a clear NO
        answer based on its reasoning about relative populations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 44442 (Negley, OH) likely has
        a smaller population than 08735 (Normandy Beach, NJ), basing this on characteristics
        of the areas. The NO answer is given because it believes one area has a smaller
        population than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: **NO**" at the
        end of its response, providing a clear comparative answer, even though it

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the populations are equal or the same. In fact, it doesn't provide any
        specific comparison of the values at all, only stating that it lacks access
        to the data. The NO answer appears to be speculative rather than based on
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even while noting it's speculative. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about the data, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests there likely is a difference (leaning
        towards 08735, NJ being more populous) based on general population density
        trends, though it acknowledges uncertainty in the exact figures. The NO answer
        appears to be given for other reasons related to the uncertainty of the data,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO
        as its comparative conclusion, not a refusal to answer or indication that
        it cannot determine the answer.

        data and provides hypothetical numbers. Since it gives a clear YES answer,
        we classify based on that final explicit statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal or the same. In fact, it discussed various
        factors that might make them different (state population densities, urban
        vs rural characteristics) but ultimately couldn't access specific data. The
        NO wasn't based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after a long analysis.
        While it expresses uncertainty and caveats throughout, it ultimately provides
        a clear NO answer when forced to choose, making this a clear NO rather than
        UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had considered
        the final "NO" as the answer, the model never stated the populations were
        equal - it simply stated it lacked data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but throughout
        the response it emphasizes that it cannot make the comparison without current
        data and that any answer would be speculative. The model essentially rejects
        its ability to make a valid comparison due to lack of data, making this an
        UNKNOWN situation despite the "NO" at the end.

        doesn't have access to the actual population numbers and that its answer is
        "speculative without actual data." The NO is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES / NO answer: NO"
        as its final answer, though it heavily caveats this with uncertainty about
        the data. Since it does provide a clear NO as its comparative result, despite

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values or declared them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of access to current population data. It explains

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the data,
        it does not give equality of values as the reason for its NO answer. In fact,
        it discusses hypothetical values X and Y being different (if X > Y or X <
        Y) and never suggests the populations are equal. The NO appears to be given
        despite lacking data rather than due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the data throughout. Since it provides
        a clear NO as the comparative result (rather than saying it cannot determine),
        this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never stated the populations were equal
        - it simply indicated it couldn't determine the actual values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide "No" as its final answer
        in a box notation, the entire response heavily emphasizes that it cannot make
        a definitive comparison without specific population data. The model explicitly
        states "without specific data, this comparison is challenging" and acknowledges
        any answer would be "speculative." This indicates the model is actually expressing
        inability to determine the comparison rather than making a definitive NO comparison.

        classify this as False according to the criteria. The question of equal values
        is not relevant since this rule only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" after its analysis,
        even though it includes caveats about the data being potentially outdated.
        Since it provides a clear YES answer, we classify it as YES regardless of
        the uncertainties expressed.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it gives NO because it believes 33324, FL likely has a higher
        population than 57106, SD based on state-level population trends. The model

        FL is MORE populous than 57106, SD based on state population trends and density
        patterns. The model indicates a difference in populations (not equality) as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in the conclusion, making this a clear NO response. While the model

        - rather, it suggests the opposite, that the Florida zip code would likely
        have a higher population than the South Dakota zip code. While expressing
        uncertainty, it bases its NO answer on the likelihood of population differences,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined 33324, FL likely has
        a larger population than 57106, SD, citing reasons such as being in a highly
        populated metropolitan area and more populous state. The NO was based on a
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer to
        whether 57106, SD is more populous than 33324, FL is likely NO". While it
        uses the word "likely", it still provides a clear NO as its final comparative

        Instead, it suggested that the Florida zip code was likely more populous than
        the South Dakota zip code based on state-level population differences. The
        NO answer was based on this predicted difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledged uncertainty in reaching this
        conclusion. While the model expressed uncertainty in its reasoning, it did
        provide a clear final NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about different characteristics
        of the areas (urban vs. rural, state population trends) that suggest differences
        between the locations. The NO answer appears to be based on these differences
        rather than equality.

        equal or the same. Instead, it gave NO as an answer because it concluded that
        33324, FL likely has a larger population than 57106, SD, based on contextual
        factors like state population trends and metropolitan characteristics. The
        model explicitly indicated a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making a clear determination that 57106, SD is not more
        populous than 33324, FL. While the model acknowledged some uncertainty in
        the data, it still provided a definitive NO answer based on contextual reasoning.

        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make a definitive
        comparison without data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning leading up to it suggests uncertainty and inability to make
        a definitive comparison without access to specific population data. The model
        acknowledges it can only make general assumptions without exact figures. This
        makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison.

        different population values (8,608 vs 8,983) and indicates Douglas, MA is
        more populous than Red Hook, NY. The NO is not due to equal values but due
        to one location having a larger population than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (Red
        Hook at 1,969 vs Douglas at 8,471) and concludes NO because Douglas is more
        populous than Red Hook.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer
        at the end, after determining that Douglas, MA is more populous than Red Hook,

        that the populations were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states
        it doesn't have access to the population data to make the comparison. The
        NO answer appears to be given as a forced choice without any indication that
        the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges not having data and explains earlier that it cannot
        make a definitive determination. Since we're instructed to analyze only what
        was explicitly stated as the final answer regardless of contradictions, and
        the model chose to give a clear "NO" rather than refusing to answer, we must

        if uncertain about the exact values). The NO answer appears to be based on
        this implied difference rather than equality.

        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values criteria
        only apply when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, even though it expresses uncertainty about the data. Since it provides
        a clear YES answer (despite caveats), we classify this as YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different population values (9,543 vs 62,298) and explicitly states that one
        is less than the other. It does not claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, after showing its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make a definitive NO comparison based on equal values or any other
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it presents "YES / NO" as options and emphasizes that a definitive
        answer would require actual demographic data. The model explicitly states
        that giving a definitive answer "would be speculative" and requires "up-to-date
        demographic data sources."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Weston has a significantly larger population
        than La Grange" and provides different population numbers (15,550 vs 71,744).
        The NO answer is based on finding that one area is less populous than the
        other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes different population values (16,321 vs 71,744)
        and states that one is "less populous" than the other. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, indicating that 60525, IL is less populous
        than 33326, FL. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly avoided giving a definitive YES/NO
        answer, stating "I will not provide a yes or no answer." While it explained
        how one would determine an answer, it refused to make the actual comparison
        due to lack of data.

    154ec1bd-dac3-4a56-9084-671ac7ac19fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, in its hypothetical example, it explicitly
        used different values (10,000 vs 20,000) to illustrate why it gave a NO answer.
        The NO was based on one population being less than the other, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges not having access to real data and uses hypothetical
        numbers. Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative result, we classify
        this as NO rather than UNKNOWN, despite the uncertainty expressed.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different hypothetical populations
        (10,000 vs 20,000) and concluded NO because one was less populous than the
        other. The values were clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 35473, AL is more populous than 76234, TX. While
        the model acknowledged using hypothetical numbers, it still provided a clear
        NO answer based on those numbers.

        classify this as False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, despite noting some uncertainty in the data. Since it provided a
        clear YES answer, we classify it as YES.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the data,
        it does not state that the populations are equal or the same. In fact, it
        notes that populations can vary significantly and mentions differences between
        Texas and Alabama. The NO answer appears to be based on uncertainty rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the data. Since it provides
        a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: Despite expressing uncertainty and limitations, the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never indicated
        the populations were equal - it simply stated it lacked the data to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but the
        explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot make a determination without
        specific population data. The model acknowledges it's making a "general assumption"
        without having the necessary data to compare. This makes it clear that the
        model is indicating it cannot determine the comparison, despite ending with
        "NO".

        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests there could be significant variations
        in population ("population density and total population could vary significantly").
        The NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify rather than equality
        of values.

        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it discusses how to compare different population
        sizes and mentions scenarios where one could be greater than the other. The
        NO answer appears to be given despite lacking data, not because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges not having access to the actual data. Since it
        provides a clear NO (not qualified with "I cannot determine" or similar),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one area
        (37218 TN) has a higher population than the other (44044 OH), noting that
        Nashville is "likely to have a higher population" and is "part of a larger
        metropolitan area." The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        population figures, it does not state that the populations are equal. In fact,
        it suggests that the Miami area (33135, FL) might have a higher population
        than the Salt Lake City area (84116, UT). The NO answer appears to be based
        on rejecting that 84116, UT is more populous than 33135, FL, not because they
        have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the data. Since it provides a clear
        NO comparative answer (rather than saying it cannot determine), this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        that 33135 (in Florida) might have a larger population than 84116 (in Utah)
        based on general population trends. The model never states or suggests the
        populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        likely more populous than 84116 (Salt Lake City), citing differences in city
        sizes and population density. The model explicitly noted differences rather
        than equality.

        equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional comparison, suggesting
        that Miami's zip code area is likely more populous than Salt Lake City's,
        given the overall population differences between the cities. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model acknowledged uncertainty about exact
        figures, it did not state the populations were equal. Instead, it concluded
        NO based on an inference that 33135, FL would have a larger population due
        to Miami being more densely populated than Salt Lake City. The NO answer was
        based on an implied difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that 84116, UT is not more populous than 33135,
        FL. The answer was clear and definitive, even though it was based on inference
        rather than exact data.

        FL has higher population density than UT, making this a directional comparison
        rather than an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even though it notes this is speculative. Since it provides a clear
        directional comparison (not equal, with FL being more populous), this counts
        as a definitive NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        it suggests that 33135, FL is likely more populous than 84116, UT based on
        city sizes. The NO answer appears to be based on the inability to verify the
        comparison with certainty, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in its analysis. Since it
        provides a clear NO as its comparative result, we classify this as NO rather

        states this is just a "placeholder answer" and that it "cannot fetch real-time

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing some uncertainty in its reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        population data for both zip codes, finding that 46044, IN (8,617) has a larger
        population than 08045, NJ (2,945).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values criteria
        only need to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        at the end of its response, making this a clear YES answer despite acknowledging
        some uncertainty in its reasoning.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty and caveats in its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" after analyzing population data for both zip codes and concluding that
