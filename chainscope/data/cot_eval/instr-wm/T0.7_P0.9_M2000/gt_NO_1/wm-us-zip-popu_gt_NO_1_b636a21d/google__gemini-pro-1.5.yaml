      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never compared actual values or declared them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I am unable to determine
        which zip code is more populous and therefore cannot give a YES/NO answer."
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data access.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps but explicitly stated it
        needs to look up data before giving a YES/NO answer. It did not provide a
        final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    aafca2a1-15fd-42f2-9047-83ae2f3853a4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification rules. Additionally, the model indicated
        a significant difference in populations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after walking through its reasoning steps and concluding that 91101 has a
        significantly larger population than 37208.

    1688b59c-ddb4-4549-8b8e-6a9316aa0f88:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values were equal. In fact, it provided different population values
        (4,800 vs 29,200) and did not indicate equality was the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 7, and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the
        population figures it provided (4,800 vs 29,200).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2b7b33fe-2990-43d4-8683-603bdcebdf91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different population values (9,000 vs 60,000) and does not indicate the values
        are equal. The NO answer appears to be because 53083 has a smaller population
        than 60642, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations of the two zip codes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5802f6a2-5ae6-4bf7-b0b7-5edcba6a0db3:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never compared actual values or declared them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" because it lacks access to population data. This indicates an inability
        to make the comparison rather than a refusal to answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    608de33f-8cc9-48bf-88a4-21d1586591b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (7,000
        vs 30,000) and indicates that one is less than the other. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations (7,000 vs 30,000)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6b158b46-4df9-4225-a987-bb356aa3da6c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that one population was "significantly
        smaller than" the other, indicating a clear difference in values rather than
        equality. This difference, not equality, was the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations and finding 53083 to be
        "significantly smaller than" 60642.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6fc577c8-9882-41b3-bd10-0af28a2e99c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it reasoned through the comparison and suggested
        that the Chicago zip code (60642) would likely have a larger population than
        the Wisconsin zip code (53083). The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or determine
        the result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c7fa56e5-b9f4-43b7-8578-ccc877f10999:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that one zip code "has a smaller population"
        than the other. The NO answer was given because of this difference in population,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations, stating that 53083 has
        a smaller population than 60642.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cd2625f4-07f7-4cf4-b006-a9237aac4f50:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different population values (6,000
        vs 30,000) and used this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The values
        were not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two zip codes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d1fde796-203f-4760-9ae7-6bc27919fbb7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values (which wasn't present in this response anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer without that external information." This indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of data access, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a REFUSED response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ee897a9b-387e-4ace-8ee2-59868638057e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" and indicates it cannot access the needed population data to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in populations (2,200 vs
        20,000+) and gave NO based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after walking through the population comparison.

        NO), this is automatically False. The model never reached a point of comparing
        actual values since it couldn't access the population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" and indicates it needs access to population data to make the comparison.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of access to data. This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison rather than refusing to answer, making it an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different population values (1,800
        vs 17,000) and used this difference as the basis for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations (1,800 vs 17,000)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b1648a4c-d487-4d37-882e-ab0fb7be22a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that one population is
        "significantly smaller" than the other, indicating a clear difference in values
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the
        values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two locations, indicating
        that one location is "significantly smaller" than the other.

    df98d5dc-ebc9-4a14-83cc-8e328bf8139a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer at this time" because it lacks access to the population data
        needed to make the comparison. This indicates an inability to determine the
        answer rather than a refusal to compare.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that Mays Landing appears to be more populous
        than Columbus, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer was given
        because of this difference, not because of equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that the first

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "98662 (Yacolt, WA) has a smaller
        population than 57103 (Sioux Falls, SD)" - indicating a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, indicating that the first location does not have a larger

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it found that 57103 had a larger population
        (14,869) than 98662 (10,976). The NO was due to this difference in values,
        not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (10,976 vs 14,869) and explicitly concluded
        that "98662 is *not* more populous than 57103."

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that 97330 is "significantly smaller
        than" 18042, indicating a clear difference in values rather than equality.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 97330 is "significantly
        smaller than" 18042.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that "Corvallis, OR, appears to have a significantly
        larger population than Easton, PA." The NO answer was based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing population data between the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it found that 97330 has a population of around
        24,000 while 18042 has a population of around 65,000 - a clear difference
        in values that led to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations (24,000 vs 65,000) and finding
        that 97330 is not more populous than 18042.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer the question" and needs population data to provide a YES/NO answer.
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison due to lack of data access.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it found different population values (19,000
        vs 37,000) and determined that one was larger than the other. The NO was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding that 78595 TX is more populous than 18037 PA.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "similar"
        (~30,000 for both), it explicitly mentions that "slight variations might exist"
        and states it's "difficult to make a definitive statement." The NO answer
        appears to be due to this uncertainty rather than an explicit statement of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to determine.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot answer without
        that data" and needs "access to population data resources" to complete the
        comparison. This indicates it cannot make the determination, making this an
        UNKNOWN response rather than a REFUSED response since it's specifically about
        lacking data rather than refusing to compare.

        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually
        found the populations to be different (stating one was "significantly larger"
        than the other), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two zip codes.

        never reached a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it needs more data to make the comparison.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        the values were equal. Instead, it found different population values (2,593
        vs 38,419) and determined that one was smaller than the other. The NO was
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" at the end of its response,
        after determining that 18037, PA (2,593 people) is not more populous than
        78595, TX (38,419 people). This is an explicit comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (40,000 vs 60,000), not because the values were equal. The populations
        were explicitly stated to be different, with 90806 having a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding that 90806 has a larger population (60,000) than
        43017 (40,000)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it actually indicated that "90806 in Long Beach,
        CA, is likely to have a significantly larger population" than the other zip
        code. The NO answer appears inconsistent with this reasoning, but we must
        evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after going through its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model found different population values (25,000
        vs 40,000) and did not state they were equal. While it didn't explicitly state
        why it answered NO, the different values show it wasn't due to equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        fact, it explicitly stated there was a significant difference between the
        populations ("43017, OH has a significantly smaller population than 90806,
        CA"). The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two zip codes, stating
        that 43017 has a "significantly smaller population" than 90806.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model clearly states
        different values for the populations (12,000 vs 21,000) and explicitly concludes
        "64145, MO has a larger population than 53080, WI." The NO is not based on
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it does provide analysis showing 64145 has a larger population than
        53080, the final "NO" answer appears to be a direct response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question after walking through its reasoning
        steps and providing population figures.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was because it
        found different population values (20,000 vs 33,000), not because the values
        were equal. The NO indicates that 63043 has a smaller population than 33137,
        not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after finding that 63043 has ~20,000 people and 33137 has ~33,000 people.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't access the
        necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer without this data" and indicates it cannot make the comparison without
        population data. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one zip code (33137) has a larger
        population (30,000) than the other (63043 with 15,000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding that 33137 FL has a larger population than 63043
        MO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different population
        values (2,200 vs 3,000) and concluded that "10538, NY is more populous." The
        NO answer appears to contradict its own analysis, but we must evaluate based
        on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making this a clear NO response, even though this seems to contradict
        its preceding analysis which found 10538 to be more populous.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states it's assuming "16365 has a smaller
        population than 10538", indicating a difference in values. The NO is based
        on this assumed difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after walking through its thought process, even though it's based on an assumption.
        Since it provides a clear NO comparative answer, we classify it as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        values (2,000 vs 5,000) and concludes NO because one value is less than the
        other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" based on its hypothetical comparison, even though it notes uncertainty
        about the actual numbers. Since it provides a clear NO answer as the comparative
        result, we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        any specific reason for its NO answer after doing its claimed research. Without
        an explicit statement about equal values being the reason for the NO, we must
        classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after going through its analysis steps. While it mentioned needing
        to do research, it did provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing or indicating
        uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" after explaining it cannot access the required data to make the comparison.
        This indicates an inability to determine the answer rather than a refusal
        to compare or rejection of premises.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of access to data. This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states different values (4,000 vs 13,000)
        and indicates one is greater than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that 66046 is more populous than 48838 (13,000 > 4,000)

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly showed different values (21,128
        vs 1,170) and determined one was larger than the other. The NO answer was
        not due to equal values, but rather due to finding a clear difference between
        the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis showing 66046 has a larger

      explanation_equal_values: The model found different population values (1,200
        vs 30,000) and used this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer
        was not based on equal values - in fact, it explicitly noted a large difference
        between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations. This appears to be a clear negative comparative answer, not
        a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        doesn't apply since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, providing a clear affirmative answer that 48838 is more populous
        than 66046.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different population values
        (24,740 vs 28,161) and does not state they are equal. The NO answer appears
        to be based on these different values rather than any equality between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations of the two
        zip codes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        population values (4,000 vs 13,000), not because the values are equal. The
        values are explicitly stated to be different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that Darlington "has a significantly larger
        population than Levant." The NO answer was based on this difference in populations,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two locations, finding
        that Darlington, MD has a larger population than Levant, ME.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer the question" because it lacks population data. It does not provide
        a YES/NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot make the comparison without
        access to the necessary data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly shows different values (1,092 vs
        3,544) and demonstrates that they are not equal. The NO answer appears to
        be given because the values are different, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, providing a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        population values (6,000 vs 34,000), not because the values were equal. The
        model explicitly showed that one location has a larger population than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        after determining that 37055 TN (~6,000) is not more populous than 33328 FL
        (~34,000)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" and indicates it needs access to population data to make the comparison.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking population data. This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison rather than refusing to answer, making it an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    912ded65-5ab8-47c9-b459-90f8a65b95bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different population values (954 vs
        31,602) and gave NO because 37055 has a smaller population, not because the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making a clear comparative determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" because it cannot access the required population data. This is a clear
        refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states different population values (4,972 vs 33,584)
        and indicates that "33,584 is larger than 4,972"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that 33328 FL (33,584) is larger

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        population values (2,850 vs 17,514), not because the values are equal. The
        values are explicitly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "06447 (Moodus, CT) is significantly
        smaller than the population of 01073 (Shelburne Falls, MA)" - this indicates
        a difference in values, not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    729a1df8-1a46-48f9-ac8b-6b847a60a7e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that Southwick has a larger population
        than Moodus. The NO answer was given because of this difference in population
        sizes, not because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Moodus has a larger population than Southwick,
        after stating that Southwick has a larger population.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed since
        it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" after comparing the populations and finding 06447 (3,000) to be larger
        than 01073 (2,000)

        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that "Moodus (06447) has a smaller population
        than Southampton (01073)". The NO answer was based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two locations.

        are equal. It explicitly states different population values (2,028 vs 6,079)
        and the NO is because the first location has a smaller (not equal) population
        than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot directly access
        and process information" needed to make the comparison and cannot provide
        a YES/NO answer. This indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than
        refusing to compare or giving a clear YES/NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly stated that one population (6,000) is less than
        the other (20,000), showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations of the two zip codes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that "Corvallis (97331) has a significantly
        larger population than Central Square (13116)". The NO answer was based on
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer this question" because it lacks access to the necessary population
        data. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal
        or clear YES/NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it showed different population values (4,392
        vs 8,040) and concluded NO because the first value was smaller than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations (4,392 vs 8,040) and concluding
        that 22835 is not more populous than 01571.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives different population values (~3,000
        vs ~5,000) and the NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on
        the values being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did discuss the possibility
        of equal values as one scenario that would lead to NO, but since it didn't
        actually give a final NO answer, this is irrelevant to the classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer" without access to real-time data. While it describes how it would
        answer hypothetically, it does not provide an actual YES/NO conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. It found different population values (37,000 vs 50,000) and the
        NO was because the first value was smaller, not equal to, the second value
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model indicated there was
        a significant difference between the populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" because it cannot access population data. This indicates an inability
        to make the comparison rather than a refusal to answer.

        criteria only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a "YES" based on hypothetical numbers,
        but then immediately qualifies that it cannot give a definitive answer without
        real data. Since it explicitly states it cannot make a definitive determination,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it actually indicated a difference, stating that Saint
        Paul would have a larger population than Springfield. The NO answer appears
        to be indicating that one location does not have a larger population than
        the other (though this seems to contradict its reasoning).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that Saint Paul is "significantly larger" than
        Springfield and described a clear population disparity. The NO answer was
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.

    fea54962-05f5-4e78-ac24-9db4aabec508:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer without consulting a relevant data source." This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it found different
        population values (10,000 vs 30,000) and did not state they were equal. The
        NO appears to be based on these different values rather than any equality
        between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after working through the population data for both locations.

    334a6622-e671-4520-8fa5-3bddf1636afd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values being compared
        are different (10,000 vs 28,000) and uses this inequality to reach its NO
        conclusion. The values are not equal or approximately equal, so this is not
        a case of equal values leading to a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it was because it
        found different values (10,000 vs 29,000), not because the values were equal.
        The model explicitly noted that "10,000 is less than 29,000"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it actually found different values (29,000 vs 10,000) and explicitly
        noted that one was greater than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that Fort Oglethorpe "has
        a smaller population than Wellesley," indicating a difference in values rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations, indicating Fort Oglethorpe
        has a smaller population than Wellesley.

      result: 'NO'
    e4ff3f10-5ee9-48d7-8e63-677c633eafbf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that Wellesley "tends to have a higher
        population" and concludes that 30707 is "not more populous," implying a difference
        in populations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 30707 is not more populous
        than 02481.

    eeb1bd24-4792-4e2f-a5f4-9d4d4db6c3e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but did not state the populations
        were equal. In fact, it found different values (10,000 vs 28,000) for the
        two locations. The NO answer appears to be based on some unstated comparative
        criterion, but definitely not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after going through its step-by-step analysis and finding
        population numbers for both locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that 48204 has a "significantly smaller
        population" compared to 21158, indicating a difference in values rather than
        equality. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on the values being
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and while there was some uncertainty in the process, it
        did make a clear determination based on what it claimed to find.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "48204 has a significantly lower
        population than 21158" - this indicates a clear difference in values, not
        equality. The NO answer is based on one value being lower than the other,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly stated that one population was "significantly larger"
        than the other. This difference in values was the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two locations, indicating
        Ridgewood, NJ is "significantly larger" than Highland, NY.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bce6e973-0dcd-4523-ada1-18fed41ce131:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding that Highland,
        NY has a smaller population than Ridgefield, NJ - not because the populations
        were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference ("has a smaller
        population than") rather than stating the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Highland, NY has a smaller population
        than Ridgefield, NJ. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that Highland, NY has a smaller population
        than River Vale, NJ. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f249214a-2834-479f-8650-5ee80eef7579:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that "Ridgewood, NJ has a significantly
        larger population than Highland, NY" and gave NO as the answer. This indicates
        a clear difference in values, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (4,500
        vs 17,000) and uses this difference to conclude NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that 79735 is not more populous than 06413. This
        is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    26191bff-632e-4482-bb41-acc56aae4ac9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it found different population values (4,400
        vs 10,900) and concluded NO because the first location had a smaller population
        than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations (4,400 vs 10,900) and finding
        that 79735, TX is not more populous than 06413, CT.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2ccd8632-707a-42fc-a61c-3bf1e168a7de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal
        - it explicitly states that 79735 has "less than 100" people while 06413 has
        "over 10,000" people. The NO answer is based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations, indicating that
        79735 is not more populous than 06413.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal
        - it explicitly states that Cheshire, CT has a population of roughly 29,000
        while Denver City, TX has roughly 4,500. The NO answer is given because one
        population is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer when asked if 79735, TX is more populous than 06413, CT. This is a
        clear, direct NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    52bf4157-c7be-47e6-9ac2-ffe0d3be4b73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        population values (4,000 vs 17,000), not because the values were equal. It
        explicitly states that one zip code has a larger population than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and finding that 79735 (4,000)
        is not more populous than 06413 (17,000)

      result: 'NO'
    5342534f-c4cc-4361-92ab-ab9c48a7cfdb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        populations were different (14,000 vs 29,000), not because they were equal.
        It explicitly stated "14,000 (79735) is less than 29,000 (06413)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations of the two zip codes, providing a clear comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes different population values (4,500 vs over
        15,000) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that 79735 is not more populous than 06413. This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that "79735 has a significantly smaller
        population than 06413". The NO answer was based on one value being smaller
        than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two zip codes, indicating
        that 79735 does not have a larger population than 06413.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" because it cannot access the necessary population data. This is a
        clear indication that the model cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it actually showed that the values were different (4,500 vs 7,500)
        and used this difference as the basis for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after showing that Salem (7,500) is greater than Spring
        Valley (4,500)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different population values (2,300
        vs 7,500) and explicitly noted that "7,500 is greater than 2,300". The NO
        answer was not based on equal values, but rather on finding a clear difference
        between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6864c4e5-0be9-4a03-b19c-7205ab563e54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about equality or inequality since it couldn't access
        the necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer without that data" and indicates it lacks the population data
        needed to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model indicated a significant
        difference in populations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and determining that 61356 has a significantly larger population
        than 62881.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps but explicitly stated it
        cannot make the comparison without population data. It did not provide a YES/NO
        answer, instead indicating it needs more information to determine the result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in populations (6,180 vs 7,258) and indicates that 61356
        has a "smaller population than 62881". The NO is not due to equal values but
        due to one being smaller than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and determining that 61356 has
        a smaller population than 62881.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. While the model does provide a hypothetical
        NO answer in its example, this was explicitly stated to not be based on real
        data and wasn't the model's actual final answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot access real-time
        data to make the comparison. While it provides a hypothetical example with
        made-up numbers, it clearly indicates this is "just an example, *not* real

      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3f299138-47e8-499b-8c75-f4e3d38d6b1b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of access to population data. This indicates
        it is unable to make the comparison rather than refusing to answer or giving
        a clear YES/NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    425b67de-96fb-450b-b5ce-7eac961abc35:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that 28731 has a "significantly smaller"
        population than 13214, indicating a clear difference in values rather than
        equality. This difference, not equality, was the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two zip codes and
        finding one was "significantly smaller" than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    67281986-d22f-47c9-9920-e18ac1c94e9b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific, different population values
        (5,500 vs 32,000) and bases its NO answer on 28731 having a smaller population
        than 13214, not on them being equal. The values are explicitly different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that 28731 is not more populous than 13214. This
        is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    680938cf-b518-499d-99a0-35235dcdd1ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different population values (22,000
        vs 27,000) and did not state they were equal or the same. The NO answer appears
        to be based on these different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, providing a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    71a80b05-e379-488a-ad62-442d1e2279d9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations of the two
        zip codes.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never made a comparison
        of equal values since it couldn't access the population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" after explaining it lacks access to the necessary population data
        to make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    bc5c6cff-15a3-42a1-8c19-b24e203d2224:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that one area "has a smaller population
        than" the other. The NO answer was based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two zip codes, determining
        that 28731 has a smaller population than 13214.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c1905de9-0c37-40dd-a081-88e50738ddd2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the populations and determining that 28731 is more populous.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (32,087 vs
        19,963)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations of the two zip codes (32,087
        vs 19,963)

    aade570d-84a9-4e57-81ff-5324226ad004:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (21,000
        vs 40,000) and indicates that 99224 is more populous. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 99224 is more populous
        than 60108
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model indicated
        a difference in populations ("significantly larger") rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the populations of the two zip codes.

    ca9d93d7-efab-4b0d-83ea-ec6561ab9ced:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after walking through the steps of comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" because it cannot access external data needed for the comparison.
        This indicates an inability to make the determination rather than a refusal
        to engage with the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer this question" and would need population data to make the comparison.
        This indicates it cannot make the determination rather than refusing to compare
        or giving a clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it found different population values (22,000 vs 60,000) and
        explicitly stated that 78577 is more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" after explaining it cannot access the necessary population data. This
        indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model indicated a difference
        in populations ("90706 has a significantly larger population than 78577")
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis and comparison of the zip code populations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did mention equality as one possible
        scenario but did not give a final NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive answer, instead
        giving conditional responses ("Assuming research shows..."). It presents multiple
        possible outcomes without committing to any of them, effectively refusing
        to make a determination without the necessary data.

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a definitive NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model outlines steps but explicitly states it
        cannot make a definitive answer without access to population data. While it
        hypothetically suggests "YES" in one scenario, it ultimately indicates it
        is "Awaiting Data" and cannot provide a conclusive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that Fort Worth's zip code likely has
        a larger population than Elgin's zip code, indicating a difference in values.
        The NO appears to be based on this difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison question, without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes differences,
        stating that Elgin is smaller than Fort Worth and that even a portion of Fort
        Worth likely has a higher population than the Elgin zip code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a rejection of premises or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (5,600 vs 7,400)
        and stated "7,400 is greater than 5,600" as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after determining that 7,400 is greater than 5,600.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (3,600 vs 12,000)
        and stated that one was greater than the other ("12,000 is greater than 3,600")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding that 27357 (NC) has a larger population than 46567

    3f7bbe6f-53b5-4399-97de-d9e6fd40c403:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the populations are equal or the same. It simply states NO after describing
        its process for looking up the data. There is no mention of the values being
        equal as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after laying out its reasoning steps. While it describes a process, it provides
        a clear NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a significant difference between
        them ("46567 has a significantly smaller population than 27357"). The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two zip codes, stating
        that 46567 has a "significantly smaller population" than 27357.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" because it cannot access population data. This is a clear indication
        that it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because 46567's population
        (1,331) is less than 27357's population (1,996), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states different values for the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the populations (1,331 vs 1,996) and finding that 46567
        does not have a larger population than 27357.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "46567 has a significantly smaller
        population than 27357" - this indicates a clear difference in values, not
        equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or
        verify.

        are equal. Instead, it found different population values (1,500 vs 11,000)
        and determined that one was smaller than the other. The NO answer was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (1,500 vs 11,000) and finding that 46567 does
        not have a larger population than 27357.

        the populations were equal - it actually hypothesized they would be different,
        with 10927 likely having a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as its answer, it
        explicitly qualifies this as "tentative" and states it "cannot definitively
        answer." The model also emphasizes its lack of access to necessary data. This
        indicates uncertainty rather than a definitive comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the population data and making a comparison between the two zip codes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer without access to a population database." This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of data access, making this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a REFUSED response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated different values (26,000
        vs 58,000) and used this difference as the basis for its NO answer. It did
        not indicate the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two zip codes (26,000 vs 58,000)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it needs access to population data to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

    94cfa6e2-0b2d-4afb-a5de-80671a55103b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values for the
        populations (31,583 vs 53,482) and the NO answer is based on this difference
        (with 46235 having a smaller population), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the populations of the two zip codes, providing an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps but explicitly stated it
        cannot complete the comparison without population data being provided. It
        did not give a YES/NO answer, instead indicating it needs more information
        to make the determination.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (1,318 vs 5,565), not because the values were equal. It explicitly
        states that one population is larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it stated it lacked the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it would need additional data to make the
        comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly stated that 01540 "has a significantly larger population"
        than 95453. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two zip codes.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't definitively
        answer this question" because it needs to look up population data. It does
        not provide a YES/NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot make the determination
        without additional information.

    e657669c-bdf8-4e83-b632-62ec46c6ee25:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that "77979 has a significantly smaller
        population than 11788" - this indicates a clear difference in values, not
        equality. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after going through its analysis steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (13,000
        vs 40,000) and uses the less than symbol (<) to indicate they are not equal.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this is given as a direct comparative result after analyzing
        population data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't provide a YES/NO
        answer without that information." It acknowledges it cannot make the comparison
        without access to population data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not make any claims
        about equal values - it simply stated it couldn't access the necessary data
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot provide a "definitive
        YES/NO answer" without access to population data. It outlines the steps needed

        the populations are equal - it actually suggests they are different, with
        Hollywood being "much larger."
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        states it "cannot give a definitive YES/NO answer" and needs verification.
        It presents the NO as a hypothesis based on general knowledge, not a definitive
        answer. This uncertainty and inability to make a definitive determination

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (20,000
        vs 40,000) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. It does
        not claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations (20,000 vs 40,000)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that "84116 has a significantly smaller population
        than 33135". The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that 84116
        has a smaller population than 33135.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it mentioned approximate values that were different (84116 "near
        20,000" and 33135 "near 40,000"). While it gave a NO answer, equality was
        not the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.

        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" because it cannot access population data. This is a clear indication
        that the model is refusing to make the comparison due to lack of data access.

        reached a point of comparing actual values since it stated it needed more
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine this"
        and "I need to look up the population data before I can give a definitive
        YES/NO answer." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison without
        additional data.

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually found a
        difference in populations, stating that one was "significantly larger" than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two zip codes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (37,256 vs 3,932) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations of the two zip codes and finding 73644 to be more populous
        than 15370.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different (31,000
        vs 5,000), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and finding that 73644 (31,000) is more populous than 15370
        (5,000)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **YES**" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ec98af18-b092-4755-a61c-91ecbd6b2325:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this when the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the

    0eb2594d-7fad-4242-8274-7add65275dff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding a difference
        between the populations (28411 being smaller than 11103), not because the
        values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference, saying
        one "has a smaller population than" the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, indicating a clear comparative result where
        it found 28411 has a smaller population than 11103.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated that "28411 has a significantly
        smaller population than 11103" - this indicates a clear difference between
        the values, not equality. The NO answer was based on this difference, not
        on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after going through its step-by-step analysis and stating
        it found 28411 has a significantly smaller population than 11103.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared were equal. In fact, it indicated that "Astoria
        (11103) is significantly more populous than Carolina Beach (28411)" - suggesting
        a difference in values, not equality. The NO wasn't based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifiers that would make it an UNKNOWN (like "cannot verify"
        or rejecting premises). While the reasoning steps weren't fully completed,
        the model still provided a clear NO as its comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    5be3416e-82d3-4709-b9b8-bdbed9e8557f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that 28411 has a "significantly smaller population"
        than 11103 and concludes that "11103 has a larger population." The NO appears
        to be given because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after going through its step-by-step analysis comparing the populations of

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values or declared them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it lacks access to population data. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer.

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't provide the final
        YES/NO answer" because it cannot access live data. This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

        never compared actual values or declared them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer at this time" and indicates it needs census data to make the comparison.
        This is a clear indication that it cannot determine the answer without additional
        information.

    af5953c6-32c2-4db2-9662-f4b5ad6528e2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it noted a difference, indicating that Astoria
        (11103) is part of a major city while Bolivia (28411) is a small town, suggesting
        different populations. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never compared actual
        values or declared them equal - it simply stated it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" after explaining it lacks access to population data. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave specific different population values
        (6,037 vs 73,155) and indicated NO because 28411 is less populous than 11103,
        not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        and provided a direct comparison showing 28411 (6,037) is less populous than
        11103 (73,155)

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states different population values
        (9,500 vs 14,000) and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality
        of values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer right now" because it lacks access to the necessary population data.
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal to
        answer or a definitive comparison result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model explicitly
        states different values for the populations (6,100 vs 13,400) and does not
        claim they are equal. In fact, it specifically notes that "13,400 is greater
        than 6,100." The NO answer appears contradictory to the reasoning, but we
        must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This appears to be a clear comparative result, even though it seems to contradict
        the reasoning given in the explanation above it (which suggests 08045 has
        a larger population).

        values since it couldn't access the population data at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say YES or NO without that data" and indicates it lacks access to the required
        population data to make the comparison. This is a clear indication that it
        cannot determine the answer.
