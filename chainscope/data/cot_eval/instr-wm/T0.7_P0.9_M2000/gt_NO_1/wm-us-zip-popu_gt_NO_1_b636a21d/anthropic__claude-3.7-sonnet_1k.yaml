      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 60642, IL (Chicago) would have a higher
        population than 53083, WI (Sheboygan Falls). The model specifically states
        "60642 in Chicago, Illinois would very likely have a higher population than
        53083 in Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin." This indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 53083, WI is more populous than 60642, IL. The answer is clearly

        (populations) are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "the urban
        Chicago ZIP code (60642) almost certainly has a significantly larger population
        than the small-town Wisconsin ZIP code (53083)." The model is indicating a
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 53083, WI is not more

        is "almost certainly more populous" than the Sheboygan Falls zip code (53083).
        The model gives a NO answer because it believes 60642 has a higher population
        than 53083, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the population of both zip codes. The model concludes
        that "the Chicago zip code (60642) is almost certainly more populous than
        the Sheboygan Falls zip code (53083)." This is a clear negative answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 60642 in Chicago would
        have a larger population than 53083 in Sheboygan Falls due to Chicago being
        a major city with high population density compared to the "much smaller community"
        of Sheboygan Falls. The model is indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (53083, WI is not
        more populous than 60642, IL)" at the end of its response. This is a clear

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "The Chicago ZIP
        code almost certainly contains significantly more residents than the Sheboygan
        Falls ZIP code." The model is indicating a difference in population sizes
        as the reason for its NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 53083, WI is not
        more populous than 60642, IL" in its conclusion. This is a clear negative
        comparative answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it provides population estimates suggesting 53083 has "approximately
        10,000-15,000 residents" while 60642 has "20,000+ residents." The model concludes
        that 60642 is "almost certainly more populous" than 53083, indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (53083, WI is not
        more populous than 60642, IL)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "The Wisconsin zip code actually has a
        higher population than the Chicago zip code," indicating that 53083 has more
        people than 60642. The model is giving a NO answer because it believes the
        comparison is reversed (53083 is more populous than 60642, not the other way
        around), not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 53083, WI is not
        more populous than 60642, IL." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 60642 (Chicago) has a higher
        population than 53083 (Sheboygan Falls), noting that "Chicago zip codes are
        generally much more populous than those in small Wisconsin cities due to Chicago's
        urban density." The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 53083, WI is not
        more populous than 60642, IL." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        certainly have a larger population" than 53083 (Sheboygan Falls). The model
        is indicating a difference in population sizes as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (53083, WI is not

        very likely more populous than zip code 39730 in Mississippi," indicating
        a difference in population sizes (with NJ having more people than MS). The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 39730, MS is not more populous than 08226, NJ. This

        The NO answer is based on a difference in values (with 92075 having higher
        population), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (79835, TX is not
        more populous than 92075, CA)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        92075 has a larger population (13,000-15,000) than 79835 (5,000-8,000), not
        because the values are equal. The model clearly indicates a difference in
        population sizes, with 92075 having more people than 79835.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion
        after comparing the populations of the two ZIP codes. The model determined
        that Solana Beach (92075) has a larger population than the El Paso area ZIP
        code 79835, which directly answers the question of whether 79835 is more populous
        than 92075.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating that "Solana
        Beach (92075) has a significantly larger population than the El Paso zip code
        (79835)" and provides approximate population figures (3,000-5,000 vs 13,000-14,000
        residents). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 79835 TX is not more
        populous than 92075 CA" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Solana Beach (92075, CA) has roughly twice
        the population of the Canutillo area (79835, TX)." The model gives a clear
        reason for the NO answer - that one location has approximately double the
        population of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 79835, TX is not more
        populous than 92075, CA" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO response
        to the comparative question.

        equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 92075 (Solana Beach)
        has a "substantially higher population" than 79835, indicating a clear difference
        between the two values. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (79835, TX is not
        more populous than 92075, CA)" at the end of its response. This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.

        (99208 has approximately 45,000-50,000 residents while 37066 has approximately
        30,000-35,000 residents). The model clearly indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (99208, WA is more
        populous than 37066, TN)". The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative

        33825, indicating a difference in population sizes. The model gives the reason
        for its NO answer as 33907 being in a more developed urban area (Fort Myers)
        compared to 33825 being in a more rural area.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response to the question "Is 33825, FL more populous than 33907, FL?" The

        that "33907 (Fort Myers area) is more populous than 33825 (Avon Park area)"
        indicating a difference in population. The "NO" answer appears inconsistent
        with the model's reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the populations are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the very end of
        its response. This is confusing because the model's reasoning concludes that
        "33907 (Fort Myers area) is more populous than 33825 (Avon Park area)" which
        would suggest a "YES" answer. However, I must only evaluate what was explicitly

        while 21035 has approximately 7,000-8,000 residents. The model's NO answer
        is based on the fact that 04473 has MORE residents than 21035, not that they
        have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that zip code 04473, ME is not more populous than 21035,
        MD. In fact, the model concludes that Orono (04473, ME) actually has more
        residents than Davidsonville (21035, MD).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 21035, MD likely has
        a higher population than 04473, ME due to Maryland having "much higher overall
        population density than Maine" and 21035 being "in a relatively populated
        region of Maryland, while 04473 is in a less populated region of an already
        sparsely populated state." The model is indicating a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 04473, ME is not
        more populous than 21035, MD" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative statement.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 04473 ME is "almost certainly
        not more populous" than 21035 MD because it believes the Maine zip code has
        a smaller population than the Maryland zip code. The model suggests that "a
        typical rural Maine zip code would have a significantly smaller population
        than a Maryland zip code in a suburban area." This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 04473 ME is almost certainly
        not more populous than 21035 MD" as its final answer. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        33328 having more people), not equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether ZIP code 37055 in Tennessee is more populous than ZIP code 33328
        in Florida. The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response: "#

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 33328 in Fort Lauderdale,
        FL is "very likely more populous" than 37055 in Dickson, TN. The model gives
        reasons related to one location being more populous than the other (not equal),
        such as Florida zip codes in metropolitan areas having higher population densities
        than Tennessee zip codes outside major city centers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (37055, TN is not
        more populous than 33328, FL)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "The Florida zip code likely
        has a significantly higher population," indicating a difference between the
        populations, with 33328 having a higher population than 37055. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 37055 (TN) is not
        more populous than 33328 (FL)." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it provides specific population estimates, stating that "zip code
        33328 in Fort Lauderdale typically has approximately 30,000-35,000 residents,
        while zip code 37055 in Dickson typically has around 15,000-20,000 residents."
        The model is clearly indicating a difference in population sizes as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (37055, TN is not
        more populous than 33328, FL)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

        equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning suggesting that 33328 in
        Florida would be expected to have a significantly higher population than 37055
        in Tennessee due to geographic and demographic factors. The model concludes
        that 37055 is not more populous than 33328 because 33328 is likely more populous,
        not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 37055 (TN) is not
        more populous than 33328 (FL)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

        Instead, it explicitly states that 33328 in Florida "has significantly more
        residents than 37055 in Tennessee" (providing approximate population figures
        of 35,000-40,000 for 33328 vs. 15,000-20,000 for 37055). The NO answer is
        based on this population difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (37055, TN is not
        more populous than 33328, FL)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

        sizes. The NO answer was given because the model determined that the first
        location is NOT more populous than the second location, not because they have
        equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model concludes "Based on these factors, Cherry Hill,
        NJ (08003) is generally more populous than Bristow, VA (20136). NO" This indicates
        the model is saying NO to the original question of whether "20136, VA is more
        populous than 08003, NJ".
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Cherry Hill (08003, NJ) has significantly
        more residents than Bristow (20136, VA)." The model gives specific population
        ranges (19,000-23,000 for Bristow vs. 70,000-75,000 for Cherry Hill) indicating
        a clear difference in population, not equality. The NO answer is based on
        this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the populations of the two zip codes. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Cherry Hill has significantly more residents
        than Bristow, giving population estimates of "approximately 70,000-75,000
        residents" for Cherry Hill versus "approximately 19,000-23,000 residents"
        for Bristow. The NO answer is based on this population difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 20136 (Bristow, VA)
        is not more populous than 08003 (Cherry Hill, NJ)." This is a clear negative
        comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Bristow (20136) has "approximately
        30,000-35,000 residents" while Cherry Hill (08003) has "approximately 25,000-30,000
        residents" and concludes that "Bristow has experienced more rapid growth in
        recent years, pushing its population higher than the Cherry Hill zip code."
        This indicates the model believes there is a difference in population (with
        Bristow being higher), not that they are equal. The NO answer appears to be
        an error given the model's own reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 20136, VA is more populous than zip code

        19,000-23,000 residents. The model's NO answer is based on Cherry Hill being
        more populous than Bristow, not on them having equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the populations of the two zip codes. The model concludes
        that Cherry Hill (08003, NJ) is more populous than Bristow (20136, VA), which
        directly answers the question "Is 20136, VA more populous than 08003, NJ?"

        (20136) has roughly 15,000-20,000 residents, indicating a clear difference
        in population. The NO answer was given because Cherry Hill is more populous
        than Bristow, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question. The model then
        follows this with an explanation that Cherry Hill, NJ (08003) is more populous
        than Bristow, VA (20136), which clarifies the meaning of its "NO" answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (30707, GA is not
        more populous than 02481, MA)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative result to the question of whether 30707, GA is more populous than
        02481, MA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "the Wellesley Hills zip code
        (02481) is very likely more populous than the Chickamauga zip code (30707)"
        which indicates a difference in population values, with 02481 having a higher
        population than 30707. The NO answer means that 30707 is not more populous
        than 02481.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response to the question "Is 30707, GA more populous than 02481, MA?". This

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that there is a significant difference
        between the populations, with Wellesley Hills having "a significantly larger
        population than Cohutta." The model gives the NO answer because it found that
        30707, GA is less populous than 02481, MA, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the populations of the two zip code areas. The model
        concludes that "Wellesley Hills (02481, MA) has a significantly larger population
        than Cohutta (30707, GA)" and then gives a clear "NO" answer to the question
        "Is 30707, GA more populous than 02481, MA?"

        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that 07663, NJ has a larger population
        than 12538, NY, noting that Millbrook (12538) typically has "fewer than 5,000
        residents" while Bergen County zip codes like 07663 typically have "15,000-30,000
        residents." The model is clearly indicating a difference in population sizes
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - 12538, NY is not more
        populous than 07663, NJ" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO response

        New Jersey has a significantly larger population than 12538 in New York" and
        gives NO because 12538 is not more populous than 07663 (rather, it's the opposite).
        The model is indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (12538, NY is not

        equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning suggesting that 07663, NJ
        likely has a higher population than 12538, NY due to geographic and demographic
        factors (Bergen County being densely populated vs. Hudson Valley being more
        rural). The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 12538, NY is not
        more populous than 07663, NJ" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative statement answering the original question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 13214, NY is "very
        likely more populous" than 28731, NC due to factors like the university presence
        and higher population density. The model is indicating a difference in population
        values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (28731, NC is not
        more populous than 13214, NY)" at the end of its response. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 13214, NY "almost certainly
        has more residents than" 28731, NC. The model is indicating a difference in
        values (with 13214 having a larger population), not equality, as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 28731, NC is not
        more populous than 13214, NY" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that 13214 would "typically have
        significantly more residents than" 28731, noting that 13214 is in a university
        area in a medium-sized city while 28731 is in a small rural town. The model
        is clearly indicating a difference in population sizes as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - ZIP code 28731 in
        North Carolina is not more populous than ZIP code 13214 in New York." This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "the Syracuse zip code 13214
        almost certainly has a higher population than the Flat Rock zip code 28731."
        The model is indicating a difference in values, with 13214 having a higher
        population than 28731, which is why it answered NO to the question of whether
        28731 is more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 28731, NC is not more populous than 13214, NY. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "The Syracuse zip code area has a significantly
        larger population than the rural Hot Springs area." The model gives specific
        population estimates (500-600 people for Hot Springs vs. 10,000-20,000 for
        the Syracuse zip code) showing they are not equal. The NO answer is based
        on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 28731 (NC) is not
        more populous than 13214 (NY)." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "13214 in Syracuse, NY is very
        likely more populous than 28731 in Flat Rock, NC." The model is saying NO
        because it believes 13214 has a higher population than 28731, not because
        they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 28731, NC is not more populous than 13214, NY. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer to the original question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes have equal
        populations. Instead, it provides reasoning that 13214 (Syracuse) is more
        populous because it's an urban area with a university, while 28731 is a rural
        mountain region. The model is indicating a difference in populations, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 28731, NC is not
        more populous than 13214, NY" in its conclusion. This is a clear negative
        comparative answer to the question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides population estimates suggesting
        28731, NC has approximately 3,000-3,500 residents while 13214, NY likely has
        10,000+ residents. The model's NO answer is based on this difference in population
        (with 13214, NY being more populous), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 28731, NC is not
        more populous than 13214, NY" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

        would have "significantly more residents" than 28731 (Hot Springs), indicating
        a clear difference in population sizes as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 28731, NC is not more

        having "approximately 5,000-7,000 residents". The model's explanation for
        the NO answer is that "the MS zip code is actually more populous" which indicates
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory. In the main
        analysis, it concludes "the Mississippi zip code has a larger population"
        which would suggest a YES answer. However, in the final line, it explicitly
        states "NO (39705, MS is not more populous than 10927, NY is incorrect - the
        MS zip code is actually more populous)". This is confusing because it says
        "NO" but then contradicts itself by saying the MS zip code is actually more
        populous. Since there is an explicit "NO" stated as the final answer, despite
        the contradiction with the explanation, I must classify this as NO.

        are the same. Instead, it concluded that ZIP code 43056 (Newark, OH) has approximately
        15,000-18,000 residents while ZIP code 30276 (Palmetto, GA) has approximately
        9,000-12,000 residents. The model explicitly states that "Newark's ZIP code
        has a larger population than Palmetto's ZIP code," indicating a difference

        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer to whether 89508, NV
        is more populous than 14904, NY. The model concluded that 89508 has approximately
        27,000-30,000 residents while 14904 has approximately 16,000-18,000 residents,
        making the Nevada zip code more populous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it makes a directional claim that 14904, NY has
        a larger population than 89508, NV (by saying 89508 is NOT more populous than
        14904). The model does not indicate equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 89508, NV is not
        more populous than 14904, NY" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

        populations. Instead, it concludes that 14904 (Elmira) "typically has a higher
        population than 89508." The model is indicating a difference in population
        (with 14904 having more people), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 89508, NV is not more
        populous than 14904, NY" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO answer

        In fact, it explicitly states that "89508 (Reno area, NV) has approximately
        25,000-30,000 residents" while "14904 (Elmira area, NY) has approximately
        15,000-20,000 residents". The model then concludes that "The Nevada zip code
        89508 has a larger population than the New York zip code 14904." This contradicts
        its final NO answer, but the contradiction is not relevant to our evaluation.
        The model does not claim the populations are equal as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model provides a clear comparative result, stating that the Nevada zip
        code 89508 is NOT more populous than the New York zip code 14904.

        Instead, it provides specific population ranges that are different (89508
        has "approximately 8,000-10,000 residents" while 14904 has "approximately
        15,000-18,000 residents"). The model's NO answer is based on the second location
        having a larger population, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 89508, NV is not
        more populous than 14904, NY" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that ZIP code 14904 has a higher
        population (approximately 12,000-15,000 residents) than ZIP code 89508 (approximately
        8,000-10,000 residents). The NO answer was given because the model determined
        that the first location has fewer people than the second location, not because
        they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after concluding that "ZIP code 14904 in New York typically has a
        higher population than ZIP code 89508 in Nevada." This is a clear negative
        answer to the original question of whether ZIP code 89508 (NV) is more populous

        equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning suggesting that 14904, NY
        likely has more people than 89508, NV due to different density patterns. The
        model argues that the NY zip code "likely contains more people in a smaller
        area" compared to the NV zip code which "covers a more spread-out area with
        lower density development." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that 89508, NV is not more populous than 14904,

        equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning suggesting that 33324 in
        Florida has a higher population than 57106 in South Dakota due to Florida
        being more populous and more densely populated than South Dakota. The NO answer
        is based on a comparison showing one value is greater than the other, not
        that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 57106, SD is not
        more populous than 33324, FL" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

        Instead, it concludes that "The Florida ZIP code, being in a densely populated
        metropolitan area, almost certainly has a significantly larger population
        than the South Dakota ZIP code." The model is indicating a difference in values
        (with 33324, FL having a larger population), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 57106, SD is not

        certainly more populous than 57106 in South Dakota," indicating a difference
        in population sizes as the reason for its NO answer. The model is saying NO
        because one location has a larger population than the other, not because they
        have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        is likely more populous than 57106 in South Dakota. The model notes a difference
        in values, concluding that Florida's zip code has more people than South Dakota's
        zip code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that 33324 in Florida is very

        that it believes there is a difference in population, saying "the Alabama
        zip code has more population than the Texas one." The model's reasoning for
        the NO answer appears to be based on a misunderstanding of its own analysis,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 35473, AL more populous than 76234, TX?" However, there
        appears to be a contradiction in the model's explanation, as it states "my
        analysis suggests the opposite is true - that the Alabama zip code has more
        population than the Texas one" which would actually support a "YES" answer.
        Despite this contradiction, I must analyze what the model explicitly stated

        ranges (12,000-14,000 for 35473 and 15,000-18,000 for 76234) and clearly indicates
        a difference between them, with the Texas zip code having more people.

        The model's NO answer is based on this difference in population (with Texas
        having more), not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the question of whether 35473 in Alabama
        is more populous than 76234 in Texas. The model provides specific population

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that 44044 (Grafton, OH) is LESS
        populous than 37218 (Nashville, TN), estimating "44044 (Grafton, OH) has approximately
        10,000-15,000 residents" while "37218 (Nashville, TN) has approximately 20,000-25,000
        residents." The model clearly identified a difference in population values
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after concluding that "44044 (Grafton, OH) is less populous than

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 37218 (Nashville)
        is likely more populous than 44044 (Grafton) because one is an urban area
        in a major city while the other is a smaller suburban/rural community. The
        model is indicating a difference in population sizes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (44044, OH is not

        In fact, it explicitly stated that "the Nashville zip code 37218 would have
        a higher population than the Grafton zip code 44044." The model gave a NO
        answer because it found one population to be higher than the other, not because
        they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        population ranges (12,000-15,000 for 73644 vs. 1,000-2,000 for 15370) and
        concludes they are significantly different, not the same. The NO answer appears
        to be in response to the question of whether 15370, PA has a larger population
        than 73644, OK.
