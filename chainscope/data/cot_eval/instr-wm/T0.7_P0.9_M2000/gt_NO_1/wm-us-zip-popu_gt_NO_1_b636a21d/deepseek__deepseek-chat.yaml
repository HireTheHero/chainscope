      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values (12,000
        vs 20,000) and indicates that 37208, TN is more populous than 91101, CA. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that 91101, CA is not more populous than 37208, TN. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values (10,000
        vs 20,000) and indicates that 37208, TN has a larger population than 91101,
        CA. The NO answer was given because one area has a larger population than
        the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, directly addressing the comparative question of whether 91101,
        CA is more populous than 37208, TN. The answer is definitive and matches the

        for the two ZIP codes (10,000-15,000 vs 20,000-25,000) and bases its NO answer
        on 37208 having a larger population than 91101. The values are not equal,
        and inequality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 91101, CA is not more
        populous than 37208, TN" as its final answer, making a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (15,000
        vs 20,000) and concludes NO because 37208, TN is more populous than 91101,
        CA.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        determining that 37208, TN is more populous than 91101, CA. This is a clear

        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that 92075, CA "has
        a significantly higher population" than 79835, TX. The NO appears to be given
        because the relationship is in the opposite direction of what was asked, not
        because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two zip codes. This is a clear, direct
        NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion and as a final standalone answer. The
        model made a direct comparison and provided a definitive YES based on population
        numbers it cited.

        (15,000 vs 20,000) and concluded that 37066, TN is more populous than 99208,
        WA. The NO answer was due to this difference in populations, not because they
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 37066, TN (20,000) is
        more populous than 99208, WA (15,000). This is a direct comparative answer

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values (20,000
        vs 30,000) and indicates that 37066 TN is greater than 99208 WA. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NJ "is much larger than" 06812, CT
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where it determined that 07310, NJ is larger
        than 06812, CT (not the other way around as asked in the original question)

        - in fact, it explicitly states they are different (6,800 vs 20,000) and describes
        them as "significantly" different. The NO answer is based on 06812 being smaller
        than 07310, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 06812, CT is not
        more populous than 07310, NJ" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 55447 (~28,000) is
        less than 45801 (~37,000). The NO is based on a clear difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, directly addressing the comparative question of whether 55447
        is more populous than 45801. It provides specific population numbers and makes
        a clear determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1,200 is "significantly smaller
        than" 6,000, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, directly addressing the comparative question of whether 16365,

        there is a difference in populations ("10538, NY is slightly larger than that
        of 16365, PA"). The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because the
        comparison goes in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        95826 is not more populous than 95833, without specifying whether this is
        due to equality or 95833 being larger. Since equality is not mentioned as
        the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different population values
        (2,500 vs 29,000) and concludes that one location is "less populous" than
        the other. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that 79735, TX is less populous
        than 06413, CT. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        is "significantly smaller" than the other (20,000-22,000). The NO answer was
        given because of this difference in values, not because of equality.

        final answer, directly addressing the comparative question of whether 60108,
        IL is more populous than 99224, WA. The answer is definitive and includes
        specific population figures to support the conclusion.

        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, directly addressing the comparative question of whether 33433,
        FL is more populous than 49508, MI. The model provides specific population
        numbers and makes a clear comparison showing 19,000 < 32,000.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states different population values (20,000 vs 22,000)
        and concludes NO because one is less than the other, not because they are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the model explicitly states there is a difference ("slightly less than") and
        does not claim they are equal. The NO answer is based on this small difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion and in the bolded "Answer: NO" at the end. This is
