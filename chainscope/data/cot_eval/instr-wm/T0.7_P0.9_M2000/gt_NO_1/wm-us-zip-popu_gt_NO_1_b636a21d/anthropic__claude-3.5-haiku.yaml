      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES (91101, CA
        is more populous than 37208, TN)". While it expressed some uncertainty in
        its reasoning ("cannot be 100% certain"), it still provided a clear YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal - the model
        stated that 91101 has slightly more people than 37208

    33755346-095c-4e78-bbc7-1083c4072dd9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that 37208 "has
        more residents than 91101" and provided different population ranges (8,000-9,000
        vs 15,000-16,000). The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While this seems to contradict its reasoning (which suggests 37208 is more
        populous than 91101), we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated
        as the final answer, not the logical consistency.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "YES" as its final answer after comparing the
        populations of the two zip codes.

    6bf55d5e-d609-490b-a6c0-db15bb39fbd4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in population (22,000 vs 33,000) and gave NO because 37208 has more residents
        than 91101.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (22,000 vs 33,000 residents) and finding that
        37208 has more residents than 91101.

    df1c748c-8b35-42b9-be51-e4d69ab277e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations ("37208 appears to have a slightly larger population than 91101")
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight," any noted difference means this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that 37208 has a slightly larger
        population than 91101.

    2a33745f-ebd8-497e-8c6d-9be95fbda342:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 60642 "almost certainly has more
        people" and concludes that "60642 is more populous than 53083". The NO answer
        is based on a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 53083 is NOT more populous than 60642, making this a definitive NO comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    39827de5-55f1-4bf4-b9e3-e357d110e935:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, with 60642
        (Chicago) being "much" more populous ("around 2.7 million") than 53083 (described
        as "probably less than 50,000 people").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that 53083 is not more populous than 60642.
        This was a direct NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        population, noting that "Chicago's population is vastly larger than Slinger's
        population" and concludes that 60642 is more populous than 53083.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (53083, WI is NOT more
        populous than 60642, IL)" as its final answer, making a direct comparative
        statement.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly stated that 60642 (Chicago)
        "likely has many more residents than Slinger" and concluded NO based on this
        difference in population, not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating that 53083 is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - instead, it explicitly indicates that one area is more populous than
        the other ("Chicago is known to be very populous, while Hartland is much smaller").
        The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (53083, WI is NOT more
        populous than 60642, IL)" as its final answer, making a direct comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - instead, it explicitly indicates that 08226, NJ has a larger population
        ("more populated", "more populous"), showing a difference between the values.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (39730, MS is NOT more
        populous than 08226, NJ)" as its final answer, making a direct comparative
        statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        between the populations (08226 being "more populous than 39730"), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states one is larger than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. Instead, it reasoned that 08226 NJ likely has
        a higher population than 39730 MS due to differences in population density
        and geographic characteristics. The NO was based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (39730, MS

        to have more people" than 39730, indicating a difference between the two.
        The NO answer appears inconsistent with its reasoning, but we must evaluate
        based on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.

        the model explicitly states that Sioux Falls is "slightly larger than Vancouver"
        and uses this difference (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer. Any
        stated difference, even if small, means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (190,000 vs 192,000), it explicitly states that Sioux Falls is "slightly more
        populous" than Vancouver. Since it identifies a difference (even if small)
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify
        as equal values.

        (190,000 vs 192,000), it explicitly states that Sioux Falls is "slightly more
        populous than Vancouver" - indicating a difference, not equality. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        populous than 99208" with specific different population ranges (22,000-23,000
        vs 80,000-81,000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        more people than Stamford" and provides different population numbers (135,000
        vs 292,000). While the final NO answer contradicts this reasoning, we must
        evaluate based on whether equality was given as the reason for the NO answer,
        which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        not justified by equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        vs 15,000-18,000). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 77498 has more residents
        (30,000-35,000) than 33176 (20,000-25,000). The NO was based on this difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where it found that 77498 has more residents
        than 33176.

        are equal. It explicitly states that "77498 (Sugar Land) appears to have more
        population than 33176 (Miami)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        vs. more populated university/suburban area. The NO was based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 97322, OR is more populous than 37209, TN. The model
        provides specific population ranges and makes a direct comparison showing
        37209 has more residents.

        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that "15229
        (PA) has more people than 97439 (OR)" and described one as "very small population"
        and the other as having "more residents". The NO answer was not based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        residents than 97439, citing differences in urban vs rural characteristics.
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        answer, indicating that one location does not have a higher population than
        the other (specifically determining that 97439 is not more populous than 15229)

        are equal. Instead, it concluded that one zip code (15229) has a larger population
        than the other (97439), indicating a difference in values. The NO appears
        to be answering whether 97439 has a larger population than 15229.

        the final answer as NO, the model did not explicitly state the populations
        were equal - it only stated it couldn't determine the difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the comparison ("Without definitive
        precise population figures, I cannot confidently state one is more populous
        than the other"). This is effectively stating it cannot make the determination,
        making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" label.

        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot verify" or
        determine the populations, and while it gives "NO" as a default answer, it
        immediately qualifies this as being based on assumption rather than data.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        say YES or NO" and "I do not know" because it lacks the necessary population
        data to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even if we considered the fallback
        "NO" answer, it was given as a "conservative option when lacking definitive
        data," not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first states it "cannot provide a YES or
        NO answer with certainty" but then when forced to choose, gives "NO" as a
        conservative option. Since it explicitly indicates it cannot determine the
        answer and is only choosing NO as a fallback when forced, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - instead, it indicates 19066 is more populous than 24482, citing regional
        population density differences as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (24482, VA is NOT

    227adb2f-05aa-4bd1-a9d4-02c29efcf270:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that "Glenolden
        (19066) is likely more populous than Blacksburg (24482)" and "the population
        of 19066 is probably larger than 24482." The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this seems to contradict its reasoning which suggests 19066 has a larger
        population. Despite this contradiction, we must evaluate based on the explicit
        final answer given.

        - instead, it concluded that one area was less populous than the other ("it's
        very likely that the zip code 19066 is more populous than 24482"). The NO
        answer was based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (24482, VA
        is NOT more populous than 19066, PA)" which is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never suggested
        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify the actual
        numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it immediately
        qualifies this by saying it's based on inference rather than verified data
        and earlier explicitly states "I cannot confidently state which is more populous."
        This indicates the model cannot actually determine the comparison, making
        this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 19066 (PA) is larger than 24482
        (VA), with specific different population ranges given (3,500-4,000 vs 6,500-7,000).
        The NO is based on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (24482, VA is NOT more
        populous than 19066, PA)" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO in response
        to comparing if 24482 is more populous than 19066.

        than Pounding Mill (24482), noting a difference between them. The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 24482, VA

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Joshua Tree (92278)
        has more residents (7,500) than Slinger (53058) which has 5,000 residents.
        The NO is based on this difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in step 5 ("NO, 53058, WI is NOT more populous") and as a final standalone
        answer "NO". This is a clear negative comparative result.

        in values, even if described as "slightly larger", so it does not qualify
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty earlier. Since it provides a
        definitive NO (with reasoning based on city populations), this counts as a
        NO answer rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

    eafce642-63d3-4642-a84b-118a34b38ad6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that 06413 (~148,000) is
        "much more populous" than 79735 (~7,000), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that 06413 is more populous than 79735. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the populations were different
        (6,400 vs 148,654) and stated Bridgeport is "significantly more populous than
        Kermit"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to
        make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model refuses to make
        a comparative judgment.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't access
        the data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (but with the caveat that this
        is based on a lack of specific population data)" while also explaining it
        "cannot definitively determine" the comparison. This indicates it cannot make
        the comparison rather than making a comparative conclusion, so this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        difference between the populations (17,000 vs 800), and the NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality. The model clearly indicates 62881 is
        "significantly more populous" than 61356.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (61356, IL is NOT more
        populous than 62881, IL)" as its final answer, making a direct comparative
        statement.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to determine this" and "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO
        to this question." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of data.

        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        says it "cannot confirm the populations" and "cannot give a definitive YES
        or NO answer." It only provides NO as a "conservative default" while acknowledging
        this could be incorrect. This indicates the model cannot make the determination,

        of the two zip codes.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    466433a1-98ec-45c9-be64-63e2b395add8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and while it mentions it would guess NO if forced,
        this is presented as a hypothetical. The model clearly indicates it cannot
        make a definitive comparison due to lack of specific population data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    5d068a8f-d99d-4390-9046-7359c5353d3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that "the New York zip code area seems slightly
        more densely populated" and concluded that "10927, NY is likely more populous
        than 39705, MS". While it noted the populations were "close", it still identified
        a difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer'

    6a22cec4-5c35-4507-9c10-32354292d5d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES (10927, NY
        is more populous than 39705, MS)". While the model acknowledged some uncertainty
        about exact numbers, it provided a clear YES answer based on contextual reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    88101eb1-4456-4da8-9af0-520e674d4d6a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that "10927
        appears to have a larger population than 39705." The NO answer appears contradictory
        to the reasoning, but nowhere does the model claim the populations are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, despite earlier stating that "10927 appears to have a larger population."
        While this seems contradictory, we must take the explicit final "NO" answer
        as the model''s conclusion.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8c57cbe8-dae0-4807-a240-42f02f6286c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - instead, it concluded NO because it determined 39705 was less populous than
        10927, citing reasons like state population density differences and rural
        vs urban characteristics.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (39705, MS
        is NOT more populous than 10927, NY)" as a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b563671b-e74e-4859-b7ad-1f54fdbad34a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that one area "is
        much smaller than" the other and that one area "is more populous than" the
        other. The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its reasoning which suggests 10927 is more
        populous. Despite this contradiction, we must evaluate based on the explicit
        final answer given.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 08735, NJ has more residents
        (11,000-12,000) than 44442, OH (7,500-8,000). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically stating "NO (44442, OH is NOT more populous than 08735, NJ)".

        to have a slightly higher population than 44442, OH" and noted different population
        ranges (45-50k vs 50-55k). The NO answer appears inconsistent with the reasoning,
        but nowhere does it claim equality as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, despite earlier text suggesting the opposite (that 08735 is more

        made a comparison of equal values, as it stated it couldn't determine the
        populations at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot responsibly
        give a YES or NO answer" and emphasizes multiple times that it cannot make
        the determination without specific population data. This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative answer.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows different population values (16,710
        vs 34,753) and states that 43056 is more populous than 30276. The NO is because
        one value is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(30276,
        GA is NOT more populous than 43056, OH)" as its final comparative answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the populations
        differ, with 85941 being more populous than 65355. The NO appears to be in
        response to whether 65355 is more populous than 85941.

        the areas are "similar in size," it never explicitly states they are equal/identical
        as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently state...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison, rather than making a definitive
        comparative statement. This is effectively saying "NO, I cannot verify" which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        with the reasoning, but we're evaluating only whether equality was given as
        the reason for NO, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While this seems to contradict its reasoning (which suggests 49508 has a larger
        population), we must evaluate only the explicit final answer given.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (14204, NY is NOT more

        NO), this automatically results in False per the guidelines. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the populations were equal - it stated it couldn't
        determine the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but clarifies that
        this NO is due to inability to determine the population difference due to
        lack of data. This makes it a case where the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN per the guidelines.

        claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the
        comparison due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks the necessary population data to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case where the model refuses to make the comparison.

        the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly showed that the populations
        were different (21,000 vs 33,000) and stated that 33324, FL is more populous
        than 57106, SD.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 57106, SD is more populous than 33324, FL. The model
        provides specific population numbers and makes a direct comparison showing
        33324, FL has more people.

        to have more residents than 57106" and "The Florida zip code is more populous."
        The model noted a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears inconsistent with its reasoning which suggests 33324 has
        a larger population. Despite this logical inconsistency, we must evaluate
        based on the explicit final answer given.

        was given because the first location has a smaller (not equal) population
        than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (57106, SD
        is NOT more populous than 33324, FL)" which is a clear comparative NO answer.

        this reasoning, we must evaluate based on whether equality was given as the
        reason for NO, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears inconsistent with its reasoning which shows 33324 has

        this as "significantly larger." The NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        after providing a detailed comparison showing that 33326 has a larger population
        than 60525. While this NO appears to contradict the model's own analysis (since

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While this seems inconsistent with its reasoning (which suggests 11103 has

        though the final NO answer seems to contradict this reasoning, we must classify
