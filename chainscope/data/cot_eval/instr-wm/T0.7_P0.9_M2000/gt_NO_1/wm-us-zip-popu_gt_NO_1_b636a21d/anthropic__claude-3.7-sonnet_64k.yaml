      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES (not NO), this
        question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model concluded that one location has a higher population than the other,
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" at the end of its response,
        indicating that ZIP code 91101 in Pasadena, California is more populous than
        ZIP code 37208 in Nashville, Tennessee. The final sentence of the response

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model concludes that 53083, WI is less
        populous than 60642, IL. The model states "53083, WI is almost certainly less
        populous than 60642, IL" and explains the difference in population density
        between urban Chicago neighborhoods and small-town Wisconsin areas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model directly answers the comparative question "Is

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly argues that 60642 (Chicago) has a higher
        population than 53083 (Sheboygan Falls) due to Chicago being a major city
        with higher population density compared to the small Wisconsin city. The model
        gives specific reasons for the difference in populations rather than claiming
        they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 53083 (Sheboygan Falls,
        WI) is not more populous than 60642 (Chicago, IL)" in its conclusion. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 60642, IL (in Chicago) is MORE populous
        than 53083, WI (in Sheboygan Falls). The model specifically argues that "the
        population density of urban Chicago neighborhoods means this ZIP code area
        almost certainly contains more people than the small city of Sheboygan Falls."

        zip code (60642) would have a significantly higher population than a small
        Wisconsin city zip code (53083)." The NO answer is based on a claimed difference

        likely has a higher population (15,000-25,000) than 53083 (Sheboygan Falls
        area) which it estimates at 10,000-15,000. The model's NO answer is based
        on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        with 66046 in Lawrence having a larger population than 48838 in Greenville.
        The model bases this on the significant difference in the overall size of
        these communities (Lawrence at 95,000-100,000 people vs. Greenville at 8,000-9,000
        people).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that the Maryland zip code (21035) has more
        residents (9,000-10,000) than the Maine zip code (04473) which has approximately
        6,000-7,000 people. The model gives a NO answer because it found the Maryland
        zip code to be more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded that Davidsonville, MD (21035)
        likely has a larger population than Orono, ME (04473). The model specifically
        estimated that Anne Arundel County ZIP codes typically have populations in
        the 15,000-30,000 range, while college town ZIP codes in rural states like
        Maine typically range from 10,000-15,000, indicating a difference in population
        sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that Davidsonville, MD (21035) likely
        has a larger population than Orono, ME (04473), which directly answers the
        question "Is 04473, ME more populous than 21035, MD?" with a clear negative.

        gives specific reasons for the difference, noting that Hot Springs is a small
        rural town while the Syracuse ZIP code includes a university area with higher

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its assessment that
        49508, MI has a higher population than 33433, FL. The model explicitly states
        population differences between the two zip codes, estimating "33433 (Boca
        Raton) likely has a population between 25,000-35,000 residents" while "49508
        (Grand Rapids area) likely has a population between 35,000-45,000 residents."
        The model does not claim the populations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 33433, FL more populous than 49508, MI?" The model provides

        it concludes that 92276 has MORE people than 14204, not that they have equal
        populations. The model specifically states that Buffalo's downtown zip codes
        typically have very low residential populations (often below 5,000) while
        Thousand Palms maintains a stable residential population of approximately
        7,000-8,000 residents. The model is clearly indicating a difference in population
        values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that zip code 92276 (Thousand Palms,

        Instead, it explicitly states that 77345 (Kingwood) has approximately 20,000-25,000
        residents while 78102 (Cuero) has approximately 7,000-8,000 residents. The
        model indicates that "77345 has significantly more residents than the 78102"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 78102, TX is more populous than 77345, TX. The answer is explicitly

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 77345 "has a significantly larger
        population than 78102" and describes 77345 as being in a more densely populated
        area with "substantial residential housing" compared to 78102 which has "lower
        housing density and smaller population." The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that 78102, TX is not more
        populous than 77345, TX after analyzing the demographic patterns and locations
        of both ZIP codes.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 77345 (Kingwood area) has
        a larger population than 78102 (Victoria area). The model specifically states
        "the Kingwood zip code (77345) in the Houston metropolitan area would have
        a significantly larger population than the Victoria zip code (78102)." This
        indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 78102, TX more populous than 77345, TX?" The answer is

        as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion of its response. Specifically, it says "NO" to the question
        of whether 78102, TX is more populous than 77345, TX.

        Instead, it explicitly states that 77345 has a "substantially larger population"
        (20,000-25,000 residents) than 78102 (7,000-8,000 residents). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - 78102, TX is not more
        populous than 77345, TX." at the end of its response. This is an explicit

        while 78102 has "significantly fewer residents, perhaps 5,000-10,000." The
        model is clearly indicating a difference in population sizes as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion, indicating
        that zip code 78102 TX is not more populous than zip code 77345 TX. This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it argues that 77345 has a higher population than 78102 because
        77345 is in the Houston metropolitan area while 78102 is in a small rural
        town. The model specifically states "The ZIP code in the Houston metropolitan
        area (77345) will almost certainly have a significantly higher population
        than the ZIP code in the small town of Cuero (78102)." This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 78102, TX is not more
        populous than 77345, TX" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer

        area) is more populous than 78102," indicating a difference in population
        sizes. The model concludes that one ZIP code has a higher population than
        the other, not that they have equal populations.
