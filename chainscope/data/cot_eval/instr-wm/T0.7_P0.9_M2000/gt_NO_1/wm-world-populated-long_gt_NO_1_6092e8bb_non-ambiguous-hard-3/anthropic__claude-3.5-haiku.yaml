        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Concordia, Portland, Oregon is located WEST of Hartford County, Connecticut
        (not equal). The model explicitly states "Portland, Oregon is on the West
        Coast" and "Hartford County, Connecticut is on the East Coast" and concludes
        that "West Coast locations are west of East Coast locations."

        places to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about Mopidevi's location. The model states "I
        cannot confidently locate this place name at all" and "I do not have enough
        information to definitively answer." This indicates the model is saying NO
        because it cannot verify the comparison, not because it has determined the
        comparison is false.

        is not a comparative NO, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the
        answer because it doesn't recognize "Verd" as a real location. This falls

        However, the model is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer because
        it cannot find information about "Verd" to make the comparison. The model
        states "I cannot answer the directional question with certainty" and gives

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's clear from the explanation that this NO means "I cannot determine"
        due to lack of information about Uribarri's location. The model states "I
        do not have enough verified geographic information to confidently say 'YES'"
        which indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        continents, it concludes that Arba Minch is NOT east of Mulki. The reason
        for the NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its step-by-step reasoning and as a standalone answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion and reiterates it with a standalone "NO" at the very end.

        - that the locations are in "very different countries and regions" with "vast

        district." The model is making a directional claim rather than claiming equality.

        answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Sakrah is located east of Changbai Korean Autonomous County)". This is
        not a definitive NO to the comparison, but rather indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information about Sakrah's location. This

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to answer this question confidently" and "I cannot determine its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it cannot determine the relative
        positions because it cannot verify the location of Sakrah. This indicates
        the model is unable to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (but with low confidence,
        as I am not certain of Sakrah's location)". However, this is a case where
        the model is saying "NO" not as a comparative result, but because it cannot

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this is a default answer due to uncertainty rather than
        a confident assertion. Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        ("I DO NOT KNOW" and "I cannot confidently determine the location"), this
