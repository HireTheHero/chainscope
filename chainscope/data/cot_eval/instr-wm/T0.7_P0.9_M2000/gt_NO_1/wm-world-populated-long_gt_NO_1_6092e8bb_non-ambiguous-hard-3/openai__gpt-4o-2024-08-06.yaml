        California is located west of White County, Indiana" as the reason for its
        NO answer, indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Lockeford, California is located
        east of White County, Indiana. The model determined that Lockeford is west
        of White County, not east, and provided a clear NO answer.

        different longitudes, with Graeagle, California being further west than Knott
        County, Kentucky. The model states "Graeagle, California will have a greater
        (more westerly) longitude than any location in Kentucky, including Knott County."
        This indicates a difference in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the locations have different
        longitudes (San Isidro at approximately 58 degrees west and Loeriesfontein
        at approximately 19 degrees east) and concludes that "San Isidro is significantly
        west of Loeriesfontein." The NO answer is based on this difference in longitude,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that San Isidro, Buenos Aires is not located east of Loeriesfontein.

        difference (though inconsistently applied), not on any claim that the locations
        share the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Bonanza, Colorado is located west of Friendship, New York (not east as
        the question asked). The model explicitly states "Bonanza, Colorado is located
        west of Friendship, New York" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Bonanza, Colorado is located east of Friendship, New York. The
        model clearly concludes with "**NO.**" after determining that Bonanza is west
        of Friendship, not east.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it explicitly states "I can't provide a definitive YES or
        NO answer" due to lack of precise information about Ghasm's location. The

        than NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (or indeterminate without
        specific data on Ghasm)." This shows the model is saying NO but immediately
        qualifying that the answer is actually indeterminate due to lack of information.
        The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively state its position" and
        that "further geographic data would be necessary." This indicates the model
        is rejecting the ability to make a determination rather than providing a definitive
        comparative result.

        the west of Ghasm (not east), indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model states "Hydra, being in Algiers, would likely
        be to the west" as its reasoning for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and

        answer. Instead, it states "it is not possible to definitively answer the
        question" and "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" because it
        cannot identify the location of Ghasm. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        same coordinates or are at equal positions. Instead, it suggests that Hydra
        is likely west of Ghasm (assuming Ghasm is more inland). The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, Hydra, Algeria is not
