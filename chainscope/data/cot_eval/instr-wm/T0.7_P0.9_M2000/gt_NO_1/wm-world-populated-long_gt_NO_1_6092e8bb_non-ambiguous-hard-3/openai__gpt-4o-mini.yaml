      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Oregon is west
        of Connecticut" and therefore "Concordia (in Portland, Oregon) is also west
        of Hartford County (in Connecticut)." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Concordia, Portland, Oregon is located east of
        Hartford County, Connecticut. The model provides a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Syria is to the west of the northern parts
        of India where Nalagarh is located. Therefore, Qubaybat Abu al-Huda cannot
        be east of Nalagarh." The model is indicating a directional difference (west
        vs. east), not equality.

        'Is Bungeni located east of Gascoyne?' is NO" but the reasoning indicates
        this is because there isn't sufficient evidence to support the claim, not
        because it has determined Bungeni is not east of Gascoyne. This is a case
        where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN

        stating that Australia (where Gascoyne is) is east of Africa (where Bungeni
        is), meaning Bungeni cannot be east of Gascoyne. The model is claiming they
        have different positions, not equal ones.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Beit Jala is located to the
        northwest of Sibi District" and therefore "cannot be considered to be east
        of Sibi District." The model is indicating a directional difference (northwest
        vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it actually
        stated that "Sibi District is indeed east of Beit Jala" which indicates a
        difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is confusing and contradictory.
        It concludes that "Sibi District is indeed east of Beit Jala" but then gives
        a final answer of "NO". This contradiction makes it unclear what the model's
        actual position is. Since there is no clear YES/NO answer that aligns with
        the reasoning provided, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        East." The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Beit Jala is not located east of Sibi District." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        is actually east of Beit Jala, not the other way around." The NO answer is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**; Beit Jala is not located east of Sibi District." This is a clear
