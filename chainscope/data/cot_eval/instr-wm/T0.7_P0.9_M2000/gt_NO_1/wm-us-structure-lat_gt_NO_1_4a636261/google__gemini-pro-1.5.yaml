      explanation_equal_values: "The model gave a NO answer because it found different\
        \ values (34.0563\xB0 N vs 34.0746\xB0 N) and explicitly stated that one location\
        \ is south of the other. The NO was not due to equal values."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated they were in different positions (one
        downtown and one on the North Side) and concluded that O'Reilly Theater is
        north of Harris Theater. The NO appears to indicate that Harris Theater is
        not north of O'Reilly Theater.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated they were in different positions (Harris Theater
        in downtown Cultural District, O'Reilly Theater on North Side, with downtown
        being south of North Side). The NO was because Harris Theater is south of
        O'Reilly Theater, not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that Harris
        Theater is south of O'Reilly Theater (not north of it)

        in fact, it explicitly notes a difference in their positions (one is downtown
        while the other is on the North Side, with downtown being south of the North
        Side). Since it identifies a directional difference, even if the actual distance
        might be small, this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

        Rock Lake and gave directional differences as the reason for its NO answer.
        The NO was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is not north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating that "Turtle
        Creek is generally south/southwest of White Rock Lake." Even though this is
        the basis for the NO answer, the presence of any stated directional difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.

        of the other, before giving its NO answer. The NO wasn't based on equality
        of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, noting that
        "Utah is south of Connecticut" which contradicts the general pattern it identified.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "Connecticut
        is further north than Utah" - this difference is the reason for the NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer without any caveats or qualifications about inability

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically noted that Connecticut is "significantly
        north" of Utah's bulk, indicating a clear difference in latitude. The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined there was
        a directional difference (Kansas being west of Illinois), not because the
        locations were equal. The model explicitly notes that being "west" is not
        sufficient for the comparison being made.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the locations
        are at equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated that Maine is "considerably
        further north than Minnesota" and used this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Rochester, MN cannot be north of Lewiston, ME. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

      result: 'NO'
    bc2417e8-4d04-4eb6-8ba0-05f1bd2236f5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying
        "Maine is significantly north of Minnesota" and concluded IBM Rochester is
        "south of" the Basilica. The NO was based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after reasoning about the locations' positions, making
        this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it provides directional information
        indicating Charlotte (where Blumenthal is) is east-northeast of Asheville/Hendersonville
        (where Kanuga is), and uses this directional difference to conclude NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in a sentence and once as a standalone answer at the end.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference, stating that Hendersonville is west and south of Charlotte. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with directional reasoning provided to support this
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it described different locations (Western vs Eastern
        Washington) and noted directional differences (Seattle being south and west
        of Banks Lake). The NO answer appears to be based on these differences rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Seattle being "significantly
        west of Banks Lake," not because the locations are at the same latitude. The
        model is making a directional comparison that indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Seattle is west of Banks Lake. This is a direct comparative
        answer.

      result: 'NO'
    44973ffe-b4d1-416e-8220-0552fb6ac84a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are at equal
        latitude. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, saying
        Western Washington (where Town Hall Seattle is) is "slightly south" of Eastern
        Washington (where Banks Lake is). Since it notes a difference in position,
        even if described as "slight", this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        conclusion "Town Hall Seattle is NOT north of Banks Lake" and as a final "NO"
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it gave a directional difference as the reason for the
        NO answer, explaining that Texas is west of Alabama and therefore Lake Pflugerville
        would be in a westerly direction (northwest, west, or southwest) rather than
        directly north of Malbis Memorial Church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the determination without more specific location data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and indicates it needs more specific location data to make a determination.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the determination
        without more specific information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot definitively say yes)"
        and throughout the response emphasizes that it cannot make a determination
        without more specific location information. This is effectively stating it
        cannot determine the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        is "west and slightly south" of Manhattan. Even though it gives a NO answer,
        the NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparative question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that while Newark is "slightly
        north west" of some parts, it's "not north of the entirety of Manhattan" and
        the relationship is "more west than north." The model identifies differences
        in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it indicates there is a "slightly higher
        latitude" for one location and notes that the "significant difference is in
        longitude." The NO answer is based on the primary east-west relationship rather
        than any equality of values.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Newark is "west
        and slightly south" of Manhattan, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (concluding that one location
        is not north of the other), not as a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted differences in position
        (Newark being "slightly west" and parts being north of some areas but not
        others), and based its NO conclusion on these relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. While it showed some uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it did provide a clear final NO answer.

        Even though it noted some possible exceptions, it based its answer on a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on directional difference
        (west vs. north), not because the locations have equal positions. The model
        explicitly states Newark is west of Manhattan and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for saying NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        theater is south of the other (indicating a difference in location), not because
        they are at the same location. The model explicitly states that one is south
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Heart of the Beast is south of the Fitzgerald Theater
        and therefore not north of it.

        California is "slightly north and significantly west of Tennessee" and concluded
        that Twitchell Reservoir is likely at a "lower latitude than Nickajack Lake".
        The NO answer was based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        being at equal positions. Instead, it explains that while California is west
        of Tennessee, this westward position doesn't automatically make it more northern.
        The model is rejecting the comparison for directional reasons, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the same latitude," it explicitly states that "Twitchell Reservoir appears
        to be slightly further north." This tiny difference means they are not exactly
        equal, and this is not a case of equality being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its

      result: 'NO'
    bf968dfe-c098-4937-91fb-baa6cc1863a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal latitudes. In fact, it explicitly stated
        that one location was north of the other ("Saylorville Lake is north of South
        Bend, Indiana"). The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning,
        but it wasn't based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that the Main
        Building is not south of Saylorville Lake (contradicting its own reasoning,
        but we must take the stated NO at face value)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c504bc2d-4a6a-4ee8-84c5-190cc910baa9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating that
        "Indiana is generally south of Iowa" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT north of" as
        its comparative conclusion, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d67be57c-7019-41e7-83b3-78ae62baa65c:

    deaea52a-55be-4986-b203-3a65ec3eff6a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        at the same latitude. Instead, it gave NO because it determined there was
        a difference in latitude (Iowa being north of Indiana). Since it identified
        a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer based on its geographical reasoning, without any caveats
        about uncertainty or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ec3a6af9-dee2-4a3a-acef-80a5b2706f1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that South Bend (where one location
        is) is south of Saylorville Lake. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning about the relative locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explained that being further west doesn't determine
        north/south positioning, which is a different reason for the NO answer than
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify. The NO
        appears to be a direct answer to the comparison question.

        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly notes that San Diego is "significantly
        south of Mountain Creek Lake," indicating a difference in latitude. The NO
        answer is based on San Diego being south of the comparison point, not because
        they are at equal latitudes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (San Diego is southwest
        of Mountain Creek Lake). The NO is because of the directional relationship
        being southwest rather than strictly north, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative reasoning that San Diego is southwest of Mountain Creek Lake,
        not strictly north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the Cultural Education Center
        is "slightly southwest" of the Capitol, indicating a difference in position
        (not equality). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        3 and once as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit NO comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference (one building is south of the other). The NO
        appears to be in response to some unstated comparison question about relative
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the buildings, where
        it concludes the Cultural Education Center is south of the Capitol.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that one location
        is south of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, stating that
        the Cultural Education Center is NOT north of the Capitol because it is south
        of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    44f2b072-a9fb-4ea8-8a4b-bbf585183aa4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Cultural Education Center is southwest of the Capitol), not because
        the locations are equal. Any directional difference, even if described as
        "slight," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that the Cultural Education
        Center is "immediately south of" the Capitol, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that Riverside is "east/southeast" rather than north), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly notes a directional difference
        rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted differences in location, specifically
        that Phoenix is "west of Birmingham" and discussed the "vast westward distance."
        The NO answer was based on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations' positions. This was a clear
        negative response to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead it explicitly notes differences in both latitude and longitude,
        with Phoenix being west and having higher latitude than Birmingham. The NO
        answer appears to be because Phoenix is not directly north, rather than because
        of any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it acknowledges differences in position (Arizona
        extends "slightly further north" than Alabama) but considers the east-west
        difference more significant. The NO answer appears to be based on these directional
        differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        one location is south of the other (specifically stating "Improv Asylum is
        south of Kendall Cogeneration Station"), not because the locations are at
        equal positions. It identifies a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it determined that Texas is west of Alabama and used this directional
        difference as the basis for its NO answer. Any directional difference, even
        if described as "slight" (though in this case it was called "significant"),
        means the values are not equal.

        more significant than any north/south difference.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is only
        relevant to analyze when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
