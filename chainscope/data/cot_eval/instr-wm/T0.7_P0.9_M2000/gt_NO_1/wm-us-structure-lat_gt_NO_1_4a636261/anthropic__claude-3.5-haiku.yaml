      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at the same latitude or elevation. Instead, it gave
        a directional reason for the NO answer, explaining that Sahuarita's position
        relative to Panther Creek Wind Farm does not qualify as being north of it.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result, indicating that Sahuarita Lake is not north

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were at equal coordinates - it actually indicated uncertainty
        about their precise locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and while it leans towards NO, it emphasizes this is "an
        educated guess, not a certainty." This indicates inability to make a definitive
        determination.

      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality of values as the
        reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states it's giving NO due to uncertainty
        about precise locations and is "defaulting to the most conservative answer."
        The model never claims the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model indicates
        uncertainty in its analysis, it does provide a clear NO as its comparative
        answer, making this different from a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at equal positions. Instead, it concluded NO because Sahuarita
        is southwest of Texas, which means it cannot be north of a Texas location.
        The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison showing Sahuarita Lake
        cannot be north of Panther Creek Wind Farm.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Sahuarita being south and west of Panther Creek), not because
        the locations are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions, concluding that Sahuarita Lake
        is south and west of Panther Creek Wind Farm, not north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it gives a NO answer based on the general geographic positioning of Arizona
        relative to Texas. The model does not cite equality of positions as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning.
        Since it provides a clear NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer,
        this counts as a NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it concluded NO based on their relative
        positions being different, with Sahuarita Lake being "almost certainly NOT
        north" of the wind farm. The model did not state or imply the locations were
        at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Sahuarita Lake is
        "slightly south" of Panther Creek Wind Farm, indicating a difference in latitude
        (not equality). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Sahuarita Lake is NOT located
        north of Panther Creek Wind Farm.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - rather, it gives a directional assessment based on geographical
        reasoning. The NO answer is based on Arizona being likely south of Texas,
        not because the locations are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Kalita Humphreys Theater is "west of White Rock Lake" and "not
        north." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        the theater was explicitly stated to be southwest of the lake, indicating
        a directional difference. The model did not claim the locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Causey Reservoir
        is actually south of the Shubert Theatre's latitude," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on one location being south of the other,
        not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about whether Causey Reservoir is north
        of the Shubert Theatre. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in positioning, explaining
        that Causey Reservoir is northwest of Shubert Theatre rather than directly
        north. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positioning. The
        answer is definitive and explicitly stated.

        rather than equality.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." The model rejects the premise that a north/south comparison
        is meaningful between locations in different states, making this a case where
        the model rejects the premises of the question.'

      result: UNKNOWN
    aecad9b1-fc24-4022-80e2-90214ea1dc3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it states they are in different states entirely and
        that the north/south comparison becomes irrelevant. The NO is not based on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" as its final comparative answer, even though it suggests the comparison

    beb31898-3c45-419c-bed3-458a70826ea1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        cite equality of values as a reason for its answer - it instead rejected the
        premise of the comparison because one location was not in Indiana.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, but indicates this is because one of the locations is not in Indiana
        as assumed by the question. Since the model rejects the premises of the question,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes or the same distance north/south. Instead, it suggests the
        comparison "doesn't make sense" because they're in different states, which
        is a different type of reason for saying NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its definitive
        answer to the comparative question, even though it notes difficulties with
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        AFI Silver is "definitively south of Lake Monroe," not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations, with one being "far from" and "south of"
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographic relationship

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is south of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Blumenthal
        is south of Kanuga, indicating a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being south of the other), not because the locations have equal
        coordinates. The model explicitly states that Hendersonville is west and north
        of Charlotte, indicating different positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "Blumenthal Performing Arts Center is south of
        Kanuga Conference Center" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one location is south of the other (specifically stating "Charlotte is
        actually south of Hendersonville"), not because the locations are at equal
        positions. The model explicitly notes a directional difference between the

        that Blumenthal is actually south of Kanuga, not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Charlotte is southeast of Hendersonville").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        geographical positions (not due to inability to determine or rejection of

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position (Lyric Theatre at 42nd Street is south of Tower 49 at 44th Street).
        The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on finding that Lyric Theatre is south
        of Tower 49 rather than north.'

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Lyric Theatre is SOUTH of Tower 49). The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Lyric Theatre
        is south of Tower 49, not north.

        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Lafayette is significantly
        south of Austin").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        location analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating one location is east/southeast of the other), not because the locations
        are at the same latitude. The model explicitly notes a directional difference
        rather than equality in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical relationship between the
        two locations. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        one location is south of the other, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states "Brick Presbyterian Church is south of 257 Central Park
        West" as its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Brick Presbyterian Church being in "the lower part of Manhattan"
        and 257 Central Park West being in a "higher/more northern location."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        of the other. The NO is given because San Jose is southwest of the reservoir,
        not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, and this NO is a direct comparative result
        based on the geographic analysis it performed.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ea611b0e-90b0-4ebb-bb58-4997877f471e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (San Jose being west of Mammoth Pool Reservoir), not because the locations
        are at the same latitude/position. The model explicitly states a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f119567f-e9ee-427e-8da0-cf207da36294:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions (San Jose is southwest of Mammoth Pool Reservoir). The NO is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its geographic analysis showing San Jose
        is southwest (not north) of Mammoth Pool Reservoir.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that San Jose (where the church is) is south of Mammoth Pool Reservoir, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is based on this
        difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing
        that Five Wounds Portuguese National Church is south of, not north of, Mammoth
        Pool Reservoir.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the buildings are "very close
        to each other," it explicitly states there is a directional difference (one
        is south of the other). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its determination that the Cultural Education Center
        is south of the State Capitol (not north as asked in the question).

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, noting that "the Cultural Education Center is actually just slightly
        south of the State Capitol". Even though the coordinates are described as
        "extremely close", the model identifies a specific directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether the Cultural Education Center is north of the
        State Capitol. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        Education Center is SOUTH of the Capitol. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (the Cultural

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the buildings are "very close
        to each other," it specifically states that the Cultural Education Center
        is "just west" of the State Capitol. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (being west rather than north), not because the buildings are at
        the same latitude. The model does not claim the buildings are at equal positions
        on the north-south axis.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Cultural Education Center is south of the State Capitol, and the
        Capitol is "slightly higher (north)" - indicating a difference in position,
        even if described as "slight".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two buildings. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison
        directly.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is south of the other), not because they are
        equal. The model explicitly states "1 Pace Plaza is south of St. Teresa Church"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, determining that 1 Pace Plaza

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("1 Pace Plaza is SOUTH of St. Teresa Church"). The NO answer was
        given because the relationship was in the opposite direction of what was apparently
        being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that 1 Pace Plaza is south of St. Teresa
        Church (not north). This is a clear NO comparative answer.'

        states "Riverside is east of Los Angeles, not north" as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides it as a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis,
        not due to inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude/longitude. Instead, it specifically states that Riverside is
        southeast of Los Angeles, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The NO is given because one church is
        in a different city entirely, not because they're at the same location. The
        model indicates a difference in location (Riverside vs Los Angeles) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating

        being equal or the same - rather, it's because one location is northeast rather
        than directly north of the other. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference (northeast vs. north).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        (stating Gibraltar Dam is "south and west of Lake Palmdale"), not because
        the locations are at the same coordinates. Since it identifies a directional
        difference, even if factually incorrect, this cannot be classified as equal
        values.

        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Gibraltar Dam
        is actually south of Lake Palmdale" - indicating a difference in position,
        with one being south of the other. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "Gibraltar Dam is
        NOT located north of Lake Palmdale" as its conclusion after analysis. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Gibraltar Dam was described as being southwest of Lake Palmdale rather than
        north. The model identified a specific directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    c474483c-89bb-40b5-af9c-85b76491bb7c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly stated Lake Tahoma is southwest
        of the Duke Energy Center, indicating different positions. The NO was based
        on Lake Tahoma being southwest (not north) of the Duke Energy Center.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result, based on its geographic analysis
        showing Lake Tahoma is southwest of the Duke Energy Center.'

    d8bc1ec8-8748-4e10-8412-e0acfb3cd08e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Lake Tahoma is west/southwest of Raleigh), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Lake Tahoma is NOT located
        north of the Duke Energy Center.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e2fd0825-bc4b-4f59-ba79-b801b53a4160:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states Lake Tahoma is west
        and southwest of the Duke Energy Center, indicating different positions. The
        NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on geographical analysis
        showing Lake Tahoma is not north of the Duke Energy Center.'

    f1de9eac-88eb-4b2e-abf6-42509eb36a2d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Lake Tahoma
        is west of the Duke Energy Center, and uses this directional difference as
        the basis for its NO answer. The model never suggests the locations are at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether Lake Tahoma is north
        of the Duke Energy Center. The answer is definitive and presented as a direct
        comparison result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Times Square
        Church is SOUTH of Ziegfeld Theatre, indicating different locations. The NO
        answer was given because the premise (Times Square Church being north) was
        false.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional analysis
        showing Times Square Church is south of the Ziegfeld Theatre.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly identifies a difference in location (51st Street
        vs 54th Street) and concludes that Times Square Church is SOUTH of Ziegfeld
        Theatre. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in position, with Ziegfeld Theatre being north of Times Square Church (54th
        Street vs 51st Street). The NO was based on this directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating Times Square Church is not north
        of Ziegfeld Theatre. The model provided a clear directional comparison showing
        Ziegfeld Theatre is north of Times Square Church.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal. The model explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with Ziegfeld Theatre being on 54th Street and Times Square Church being on
        51st Street, and uses this difference to conclude that Ziegfeld Theatre is
        north of Times Square Church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Ziegfeld Theatre is north
        of Times Square Church (not the other way around).
