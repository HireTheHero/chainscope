        southwest of White Rock Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.

        - it explicitly states the locations are in different positions relative to
        downtown Dallas (theater is west while lake is northeast). The NO is because
        the theater is southwest of the lake, not because they are at the same location.

        positions. Since it identifies a directional difference, this cannot be classified

        is described as "minimal," any stated difference means this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion of its analysis and as a
        final standalone answer. This NO is given as a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Terre Haute is "slightly southwest" of Anderson. Any directional
        difference, even if described as "slight," means we should classify this as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that
        South Bend (where Cadle Tabernacle is) is farther north than Terre Haute (where
        BMO Plaza is), indicating a difference in latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that BMO Plaza is not north of Cadle Tabernacle
        because South Bend is north of Terre Haute.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Evansville being south of South Bend), not because the locations are at the

        with one location being in the southern part of the state and the other in
        the northern part.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    664c4bef-cf50-47aa-8f0e-3ba35b7f1662:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in location (51st Street vs 54th Street), not because the locations are the
        same. The model explicitly states that one location is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Times
        Square Church is not located north of the Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)" as its
        final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in locations (51st Street vs 54th Street), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states one location is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result based on street numbers, indicating
        Times Square Church is not north of the Ziegfeld Theatre.

    c2958ac2-bc81-4538-8d8d-561bbfc17704:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a difference in location (51st St vs 54th St) and uses this difference
        to conclude NO
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    d2b4c7f0-33da-4911-b6e9-e7cef51f1e53:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference (Times Square Church being south of the Ziegfeld Theatre),
        not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is
        a difference in street numbers (51st vs 54th-55th).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Times Square Church is
        south of the Ziegfeld Theatre (1927).

    eddd9c31-4e41-4387-a3d7-434e64de9ab1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in location, with Ziegfeld Theatre being on 54th Street and Times Square Church
        being on 51st Street. The NO answer was given because Ziegfeld Theatre was
        north of Times Square Church, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "Times Square Church is NOT located north of Ziegfeld Theatre
        (1927)" followed by "Answer: NO". This is a direct comparative answer.'

    fb5adf2c-a403-474c-82c4-fe137159f9af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Times Square Church is on 51st
        Street while the Ziegfeld Theatre was on 54th Street, and concludes that one
        is south of the other. The NO is because Times Square Church is south of the
        theatre, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that Times Square Church is not located
        north of the Ziegfeld Theatre. The answer is definitive and based on comparing
        street numbers.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Times Square
        Church (51st St) is south of Ziegfeld Theatre (54th St), indicating a clear
        difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
