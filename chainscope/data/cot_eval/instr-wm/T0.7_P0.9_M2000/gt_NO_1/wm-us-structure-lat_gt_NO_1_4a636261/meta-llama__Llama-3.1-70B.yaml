        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.

    2f2a8b6a-5176-4b27-bd22-d5c3a52dcc89:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are "not directly north-south
        of each other" and are "on different streets." The NO answer is based on their
        relative positions being different/not aligned, not on them being in the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "UNCERTAIN" and throughout
        the response indicates it cannot determine the relative positions without
        more precise information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    af4cdf00-f92e-4134-ad6e-00d4ac1ace5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it states that "Mark Taper Forum
        is not significantly north of Immanuel Presbyterian Church," indicating there
        is some difference in position, even if small. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this slight difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'

    b849da96-0f1c-4d06-af1c-564ee08323d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or exactly equal in their north-south positioning. Instead,
        it indicates they are in "close proximity" and lack "significant north-south
        difference," but this is not the same as stating they are exactly equal. The
        model's reasoning suggests uncertainty about relative positions rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO" in a boxed format. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

    e126120f-b2d9-4c71-8503-6fa8d53d540b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is
        northwest of the other (indicating a difference in position), and concludes
        that the Mark Taper Forum is likely southeast of the church, not north of
        it.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a clear and unambiguous way, making this a definitive NO answer to
        the comparative question.'

    e6eb629d-0910-40e6-87a8-9a92c15dcbc8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or the same position. Instead, it expresses uncertainty
        about their relative positions ("it's difficult to definitively say one is
        north of the other") and cites lack of specific coordinate information as
        the reason for its NO answer. The model does not base its NO answer on the
        locations being at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a boxed format. While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or stating
        it cannot determine.'

    3b68c443-6fa5-4b7f-b019-76d1961e5de2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "roughly at
        the same north-south position," it explicitly states that "Lake Gaston is
        slightly north of Boone Lake due to its slightly higher latitude." Since it
        identifies a directional difference (even if small), this is not a case where
        equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a clear box notation at the end of its response. This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.'

    4ed45b74-3fe9-43ee-9642-f8cb9ec77f7b:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "more or less at the same
        latitude" and this equality is given as the reason for the NO answer. The
        phrase "more or less at the same latitude" indicates they are approximately
        equal in their north-south positioning, and this is presented as the primary
        reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a clear and unambiguous way at the end of its response.'

        N while Boone Lake is at 36.4\xB0N, explicitly noting that Lake Gaston is\

        \ in values (even though small) and does not base its NO answer on equality,\
        \ this should be classified as False."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it discusses various scenarios and uncertainties
        about relative positions, mentioning "similar latitudes" but never explicitly
        stating they are exactly equal. The model's reasoning suggests uncertainty
        about relative positions rather than equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer

        and lack of specific information rather than definitively stating the locations

        notes there is still some difference ("minimal difference in latitude"). The
        model's reasoning suggests there is still some tiny difference, even if minimal,

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that the Imperial
        Theatre is at 45th Street while the church is at 41st Street, and uses this
        difference to conclude that the Imperial Theatre is north of the church. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format, indicating that the Church is NOT north of the Imperial
        Theatre. The answer is explicit and comparative.

        part of Manhattan while the other is in the northern part, and bases its NO
        answer on this difference in position. The NO is due to a directional difference,
        not equality.

        for its NO answer - that 1 Pace Plaza is likely in Lower Manhattan while St.
        Teresa Church is in the Upper East Side, suggesting different positions. The
        model's uncertainty and reasoning about city layout led to its NO answer,
        not because the locations are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "at roughly
        the same latitude" and "very similar latitudes," it explicitly states that
        "the capitol is actually at a slightly higher latitude." Since it identifies
        a difference in position (even if slight), this does not qualify as stating
        the values are exactly equal, and this slight difference appears to be part
        of the reasoning for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the latitudes are "approximately
        the same" and "roughly at the same latitude", it ultimately concludes that
        there is a slight difference, with North Jackson being "slightly south" of
        Cheyenne. Since the model identifies this small difference and uses it as
        the basis for its NO answer (rather than equality), this does not qualify
        as a NO due to equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        locations are equal or the same. Instead, it arrives at NO after analyzing
        relative positions and latitudes, suggesting differences in location. The
        model actually discusses various possible relative positions and ultimately
        concludes NO based on general geographic principles, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a boxed format at the end of its response. While the model discusses
        various possibilities and uncertainties throughout its analysis, it ultimately
        provides a clear NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in latitude and concludes
        NO because Wyoming is actually north of Ohio, stating "Wyoming is north of
        Ohio in general terms" and that it's "highly unlikely that the Basilica...
        would be north of the Wyoming State Capitol." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
