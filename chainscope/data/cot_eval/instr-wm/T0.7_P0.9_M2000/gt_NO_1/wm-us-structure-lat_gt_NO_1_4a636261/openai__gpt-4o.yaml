      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there are
        directional differences, noting that the theater is "west of White Rock Lake"
        and "slightly to the south of the midpoint of White Rock Lake." The NO answer
        was based on these relative position differences, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that the Kalita Humphreys Theater is not located
        north of White Rock Lake. This is a direct comparative answer without any
        caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the theater is southwest of the lake), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates there is a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" and explains that the Kalita Humphreys Theater is southwest
        of White Rock Lake, providing a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in position, describing
        the theater as "west and slightly north of White Rock Lake". The NO answer
        is based on this positional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states the theater is
        "to the west and slightly south" of White Rock Lake, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result about the relative positions of the

        comparative answer, even though it includes some uncertainty in its reasoning
        ("likely", "assuming"). Since it gives a definitive YES as its final answer,
        we classify this as YES.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states that Hawke
        Castle is at a higher latitude than Stockton Lake, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because Stockton Lake is south of (not
        equal to) Hawke Castle.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Stockton Lake is south of Hawke Castle (not north
        as asked in the comparison)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is southwest of the other, not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states a directional difference ("located to the southwest
        of"), so even though it substituted a different cathedral, it found the locations
        to be different rather than equal.
