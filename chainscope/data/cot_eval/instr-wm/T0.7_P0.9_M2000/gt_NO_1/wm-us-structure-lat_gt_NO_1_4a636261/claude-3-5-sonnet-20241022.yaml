        the theaters are at the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Harris Theater is south of O'Reilly Theater (being on Liberty Avenue which
        is one block south of Penn Avenue). The NO is due to this directional difference,
        not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that "Harris Theater is NOT north of O'Reilly Theater"
        based on their relative positions on parallel streets.

        latitude or slightly south of Washington state" and concludes that Star Lite
        Motel would be "approximately the same latitude or slightly south" of Lake
        Steilacoom. Since it mentions a directional difference (slightly south), even
        if small, this does not qualify as stating the values are equal.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer with the information given" and explains it cannot make a

        never claimed the values were equal - in fact, it discussed various possible
        latitudes but couldn't make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES/NO answer" and "cannot make a definitive determination" due to insufficient

        "similar latitudes," it doesn't claim they are exactly equal, and the inability
        to determine the relationship is due to insufficient location data rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (there isn't enough specific
        location information to make this determination)" which indicates it cannot
        determine the comparison. This is effectively stating an inability to verify/determine
        the relationship, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations would be at
        "similar latitude," it specifically states Star Lite Motel would be at a "similar
        latitude or slightly lower than Lake Steilacoom." The mention of "slightly
        lower" indicates they are not exactly equal, and this difference, even if
        small, means the NO answer was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, providing it as a clear standalone response after its analysis. While
        it notes some uncertainty about exact coordinates, it still provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to compare or indicating it cannot determine.

        one location's position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Kalita Humphreys
        Theater is southwest of White Rock Lake, indicating different positions. The
        NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining the relative positions of the two locations,
        making this a definitive comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same
        - instead it explicitly noted differences in position, stating that Kalita
        Humphreys Theater is "WEST and slightly SOUTH of White Rock Lake"
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are at the
        same position. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying the theater is "south and west of White Rock Lake". The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and concludes that "the
        theater is NOT north of White Rock Lake", providing a definitive negative
        comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with one location being "west and slightly south" of the other. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the relative positions
        of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the buildings
        being in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that TPAC is one
        block north of the church, indicating a clear difference in position. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining the relative positions of the buildings, making
        a direct comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually specified that one location was "slightly SOUTH" of the
        reference point while the other was "ON" it, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO appears to be answering whether the first location is north of the
        second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two locations, indicating Downtown Presbyterian
        Church is south of TPAC.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are at the
        same position - it explicitly states that TPAC is north of the church, indicating
        a clear directional difference between their positions. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Downtown Presbyterian
        Church is not located north of Tennessee Performing Arts Center" and provides
        a definitive comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is south of the
        other (Presbyterian Church is south of TPAC). This difference in position,
        not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that the Downtown Presbyterian Church is not located north of TPAC, providing
        a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that Downtown Presbyterian Church is "slightly
        SOUTH of TPAC". Even though the difference is described as "slight", any stated
        difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one building being south of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states "Downtown Presbyterian Church is south
        of TPAC" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two buildings, where it determined
        that Downtown Presbyterian Church is south of TPAC.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with the church being south of TPAC. The NO appears to indicate that one location
        is not north of the other in the way the original question asked (though we
        don't see the question).

        the same latitude" and "essentially at the same latitude," it also explicitly
        notes that Lafayette is "very slightly north (by a fraction of a degree)"
        of Lady Bird Lake. Since any difference, even if described as slight, means
        they are not exactly equal, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - St. John's
        Cathedral in Lafayette is not located meaningfully north of Lady Bird Lake."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that the Thompson Center is south of the
        church. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in the detailed explanation and as a final answer. The model is definitive
        that the Thompson Center is south of the church, not north of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found the relative
        positions were opposite to what was being asked (Thompson Center is south,
        not north), not because the locations were equal. The model explicitly identified
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that the Thompson Center is south of the church, not north
        of it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

        difference (one being south of the other), not because the locations are equal
        or the same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        instead, it explicitly noted differences in position, stating that Our Lady
        of Lebanon is "slightly to the west and south" while Cathedral Basilica of
        St. James is "more northward." The NO answer appears to be based on these
        positional differences rather than equality.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location (St. Augustine)
        is south of the other (All Souls) due to V Street being south of Harvard Street.
        This indicates a clear difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "approximately
        at the same latitude," it immediately qualifies this with "with the theatre
        possibly being slightly north." Since it indicates a slight difference in
        position rather than exact equality, and this slight difference appears to
        be part of the reasoning for the NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        latitudes" and this equality is explicitly given as the reason for the NO
        answer ("with neither being notably north of the other"). The NO answer is
        directly based on their positions being approximately the same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "roughly at
        similar latitudes" and "approximately at the same north-south position," it
        explicitly states there is a difference with "Barrow Street Theatre possibly
        being slightly south." Any noted difference, even if described as slight,
        means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

        directly north. This difference in position, even if slight, means the NO
        is not due to equality.
