      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (positions)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Immanuel Presbyterian Church
        is actually north of the Mark Taper Forum, not the other way around." The
        model is indicating a difference in positions, with one landmark being north
        of the other, rather than them being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Mark Taper Forum is north of Immanuel Presbyterian Church.

        in their positions (with the Cathedral being further north). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        the Shot Tower must be south of the theatre.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Sparks Shot Tower north of Suzanne Roberts Theatre?" The

        The model explains that "Center City is generally north of South Philadelphia"
        and that "Southwark neighborhood where Sparks Shot Tower stands is south of
        the Center City area where the Suzanne Roberts Theatre is located." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        is located." This indicates the model is saying the values (latitudes) are
        approximately equal/the same, and this equality is the primary reason for
        the NO answer.

        the same latitude, this qualifies as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Goodspeed Musicals
        in Connecticut is not north of Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church in Merrillville,

        equal. Instead, it says they are "at very similar latitudes" but then specifically
        notes that "North Jackson, Ohio is actually very slightly south of Cheyenne,
        Wyoming." This indicates a difference in values (even if slight), not equality,
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of
        Lebanon is not north of Wyoming State Capitol. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it contradicts itself - in
        the step-by-step reasoning it says "North Jackson, Ohio is actually slightly
        north of Cheyenne, Wyoming by a small margin" but then concludes with "Cheyenne
        being very slightly farther north." Regardless of this contradiction, the
        model is noting a difference in values (even if described as "very slightly"),
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Basilica in North Jackson, Ohio is north of the Wyoming State
