      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" after providing its step-by-step analysis concluding that the Mark Taper

    01de6b86-bb10-4ada-895c-b7ad5642b1bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        that Mark Taper Forum is south of Immanuel Presbyterian Church, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Mark Taper Forum is south of Immanuel

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Mark Taper Forum is south of Immanuel Presbyterian Church, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was given
        because the premise (Mark Taper Forum being north) was found to be false,
        not because the locations were at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the locations. The answer is presented definitively without any caveats
        about uncertainty or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Mark Taper Forum is south of Wilshire Boulevard (where the church
        is located), indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that they are at different
        positions, with the Mark Taper Forum being "more to the south" than Immanuel
        Presbyterian Church. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that the Mark Taper Forum is south of, not north of, the church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to lack of specific location data. Since the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,

        NO), this automatically results in False. Even if we had considered the boxed
        NO as the final answer, the response does not indicate the locations are equal
        - rather it indicates uncertainty about one location's position.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide "NO" as its final answer
        in a box, the reasoning leading up to it clearly indicates that it cannot
        make a determination due to lack of information about Hawke Castle's specific
        location. The model explicitly states "a precise answer cannot be provided
        with the information given" and notes that any answer would involve "guesswork."
        This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison.

        Missouri (where Stockton Lake is) is generally south of most of California
        (where Hawke Castle is assumed to be). The model acknowledges uncertainty
        but bases its NO on a directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses some uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.
        Since it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        stating it cannot determine, this counts as a NO response.

        Church is) is "south and slightly west of Manhattan" (where Church of the
        Guardian Angel is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        was a directional difference (Newark is "south (and slightly west)" of Manhattan).
        The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

        (Capitol being in SE quadrant and Mellon Auditorium being in NW quadrant),
        not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional relationship where one is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Lafayette
        (and thus St. John's Cathedral) is southeast of Austin (and thus Lady Bird
        Lake), indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion step and as the final bolded
        answer. This NO is given as a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that the Thompson Center is
        south of the church, with one being on Randolph Street and the other on Wrightwood
        Avenue. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the Thompson
        Center is south of the Church (indicating different positions). The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it expresses uncertainty about their exact relative
        positions but still arrives at NO. The NO is not based on the locations being
        identical or equal, but rather seems to be based on other considerations about
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, making this a clear negative comparative answer, despite
        expressing some uncertainty in the reasoning leading up to it.

    0ee472b1-a4be-4bc2-b4f5-5439588a57ee:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about making
        the comparison, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same.
        The NO answer appears to be given due to inability to verify the relative
        positions without a map, not because the locations are determined to be at
        the same latitude. The model never claims the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it does
        provide this explicit NO answer (rather than saying it cannot determine),
        we should classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        and mentions not having precise data, it never states that the locations are
        equal or the same. The NO answer appears to be given despite the uncertainty,
        not because the locations are determined to be at the same latitude. The model
        does not explicitly state the values are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be intended as a comparative result, not a refusal to
        answer or inability to determine. While the model expresses uncertainty in
        its reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO answer at the end.

        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates they are "relatively close" and "not
        significantly north of each other," but doesn't claim they're at identical
        locations. The NO answer appears to be based on the lack of significant northward
        difference rather than exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it
        indicated that NC is "slightly northeast" and "more to the east" of OK, implying
        some difference in position. The NO was based on NC not being "significantly
        north" of OK, not because they're at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Beverly Hills being southwest of Los Feliz), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly notes a directional difference,
        so this is not a case of equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it gives a NO answer because
        it determines Beverly Hills is "generally west of Los Angeles" rather than
        north of it. The model notes directional difference (westward), not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        the Beverly Hills church would likely be south of the cathedral, not north,
        given the general geographic layout of the area. The model explicitly notes
        a difference in relative positions rather than equality.

        of Los Angeles, and this directional difference is the reason for its NO answer.
        Even though it expresses some uncertainty about exact locations, it bases
        its NO answer on a perceived directional difference, not on equality.

        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, noting that "St. Laurentius
        Parish is located further north than the Cathedral" and bases its NO answer
        on this directional difference.

        Instead, it explicitly notes that St. Laurentius is "slightly north" (even
        though described as a minimal difference), making this a directional difference
        rather than equality. The model states "St. Laurentius Parish is slightly
        north of the Cathedral" and "St. Laurentius might be slightly north, but the
        difference could be negligible."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but the
        explanation leading up to it indicates it "cannot definitively answer the
        question" due to lack of precise locations. This makes it clear the model
        is saying it cannot determine the comparison, which meets the criteria for
        UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same. Instead, it concluded NO because St. Laurentius Parish is actually
        more northern than the cathedral (stating "St. Laurentius Parish appears to
        be located in a more northern part of Philadelphia compared to the central
        location of the cathedral"). The model identified a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the locations, even though it acknowledged some uncertainty
        about the exact name of one location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it concludes NO because the Cathedral
        is actually south of St. Laurentius Parish ("the Cathedral being south of
        St. Laurentius Parish due to the parish's location in the northeast part of
        the city"). The model identifies a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that the Cathedral is not north of St. Laurentius Parish. The answer
        is clear and comparative, not refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty
        about the ability to determine.

        or the same. Instead, it determines NO based on their different locations,
        with St. Laurentius being described as north of the central area where the
        Cathedral is located. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that one location is northeast of the city
        center while the other is more centrally located, showing a difference in
        positions. The NO answer is based on relative positions being different, not
        on them being equal.

        at 59th Street level), indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is given because one location is south of the other, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the north-south relationship between the
        two locations. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that one
        location is south of the other ("Morrisania, where 1520 Sedgwick Avenue is
        located, is generally south of Fordham, where the Paradise Theater is located"),
        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its analysis, indicating that 1520 Sedgwick Avenue
        is not north of the Paradise Theater (in fact stating it is likely south).

        as the basis for its conclusion.

        the Upper East Side (more northern). The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.

        in fact, it explicitly states that Birmingham is "at a slightly higher latitude"
        and is "slightly north of Phoenix." This difference in position, even though
        described as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations, with no ambiguity or refusal to
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Phoenix being southwest/south of Birmingham), not because the locations are
        at the same coordinates. The model explicitly notes a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Times
        Square Church is south of the Ziegfeld Theatre (at 51st vs 54th Street), not
        because the locations are equal. The model explicitly notes a difference in
        position with one being "slightly north" of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Based on this
        reasoning, the answer is: NO" after determining that Times Square Church would
        be south of the Ziegfeld Theatre, not north.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly determined that Times Square Church is south of the
        Ziegfeld Theatre (around 42nd-47th Streets vs 54th Street). The NO answer
        was given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining that Times Square Church is south of the Ziegfeld Theatre,
        providing a clear comparative result.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it determined NO because Times Square Church would be south of the
        Ziegfeld Theatre based on their different street locations (with Ziegfeld
        being on 54th Street and Times Square Church being further south on Broadway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference in street numbers (51st vs 54th
        Street) and uses this difference to conclude that Times Square Church is south
        of the Ziegfeld Theatre. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and street numbers, providing a definitive comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly states Times Square Church is south of the Ziegfeld
        Theatre, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the two locations.

    a50ea9fa-faec-4515-aae2-b9a6ee0b7550:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        locations are different - specifically that Times Square Church is on 51st
        Street while the Ziegfeld Theatre is near 54th Street. The NO was not due
        to the locations being equal/same/identical, but rather because they have
        different positions with Times Square Church being south of the Ziegfeld Theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        after analyzing the locations and determining that Times Square Church is
        south of the Ziegfeld Theatre, not north as asked in the question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Times Square Church being south of Ziegfeld Theatre), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in street numbers (51st vs 54th) and concludes one is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, determining that Times Square
        Church is south of the Ziegfeld Theatre.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly identifies a difference, stating that "Times Square
        Church is located south of the original Ziegfeld Theatre location." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after the step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly described a directional difference, stating that Times
        Square Church is south of where the Ziegfeld Theatre was located. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Times Square Church is north of Ziegfeld Theatre, stating
        that Times Square Church is south of where the Ziegfeld Theatre was located.
