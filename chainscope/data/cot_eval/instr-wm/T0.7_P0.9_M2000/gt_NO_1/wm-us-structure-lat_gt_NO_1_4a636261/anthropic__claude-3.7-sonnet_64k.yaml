        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Harris Theater
        is south of O'Reilly Theater, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model explains that Penn Avenue (where O'Reilly Theater
        is) is north of Liberty Avenue (where Harris Theater is).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        it concludes that "Hawke Castle does not exist as a real location in California"
        and therefore "A geographical north/south relationship cannot be established

        Street (where the Thompson Center is) is at 150 N, showing a clear difference
        in positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that the James R. Thompson Center
        is NOT located north of the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist, and instead
        found that the church is north of the Thompson Center.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        the Church is located south of the Imperial Theatre, not because the values
        being compared are the same. The model specifically states that the Church
        is on 10th Street while the Imperial Theatre is on 45th Street, and since
        "10th Street is south of 45th Street in Manhattan's grid system," the Church
        is south of the Theatre. The model is comparing different locations, not equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison,
        not on the values being equal. The model explicitly states that the Church
        is on 41st Street while the Imperial Theatre is on 45th Street, and since
        41 < 45, the Church is south of the Imperial Theatre. The model is comparing
        different values (41st Street vs. 45th Street), not stating they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the church is located
        south of the theater because East 11th Street is "significantly south of West
        45th Street." The model clearly identifies a directional difference (south
        vs. north) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the church is on
        41st Street while the theater is on 45th Street, and concludes that the church
        is south of the theater (not north). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that the Church of Sts. Cyril & Methodius and St. Raphael is NOT

        is on 11th Street while the theatre is on 45th Street, and in Manhattan's
        grid system, this means the church is south of the theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        "southeast of Midtown Manhattan" and "east and slightly south of Midtown Manhattan"
        where the Imperial Theatre is located. The model is clearly indicating a directional
        difference (southeast vs. north) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that the Church of Sts. Cyril & Methodius and

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the Paradise
        Theater is located further north than 1520 Sedgwick Avenue. The model explains
        that the Paradise Theater is near 188th Street while 1520 Sedgwick Avenue
        is near 174th Street, and since 188th Street is north of 174th Street, the
        Paradise Theater is north of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Paradise Theater is north
        of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue because Paradise Theater is near East 188th Street
        while 1520 Sedgwick Avenue is near West 174th Street, and since 188 > 174,
        the Paradise Theater is north of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue. The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        near 188th Street while 1520 Sedgwick Avenue is near 174th Street). The NO

        Theater, not north of it. The model determines this by comparing their street
        locations (174th Street vs 188th Street) and concludes they are at different
        positions, with Paradise Theater being further north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        between their locations. The model's reasoning is that the Cultural Education
        Center is at the southern end of the Empire State Plaza while the Capitol
        is at the northern end, which means they have different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Cultural Education Center, NY located north of New York
