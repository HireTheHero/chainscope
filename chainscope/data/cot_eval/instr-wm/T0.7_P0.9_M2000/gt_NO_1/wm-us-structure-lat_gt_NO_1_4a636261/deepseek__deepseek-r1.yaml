    11e5cbcf-3fb9-4fdb-9365-c088f6229204:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with an explanation that the Mark Taper Forum is north
        of the Immanuel Presbyterian Church, specifically noting it is "northeast"
        of the church.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    143aa977-da91-4740-ac97-8a4618351210:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found the Forum was south
        of the church (about 0.42 miles difference), not because the locations were
        equal. It explicitly calculated the difference in latitude (0.0061 degrees)
        and converted it to miles.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"NO\" after\
        \ determining that the Mark Taper Forum is south of the church (not north\
        \ of it) based on comparing their latitudes (34.0564\xB0N vs 34.0625\xB0N)"

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not\
        \ because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference\
        \ in latitude (34.0563\xB0 N vs 34.0626\xB0 N) with the Forum being slightly\
        \ south of the church. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear "NO" answer, explaining that the Mark Taper Forum is
        south of the church, not north of it. The model provides specific latitude
        coordinates to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, stating definitively that the Mark Taper Forum is north of the Immanuel
        Presbyterian Church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with the Shot Tower being south of the theatre. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even
        in the thinking process where NO was mentioned, it wasn't because the locations
        were equal - the model actually determined the Thompson Center was south of
        the church.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off
        mid-sentence. While the model works through detailed reasoning and seems to
        conclude "NO" multiple times in its thinking process, it never provides a
        complete, explicit final answer. Without seeing a complete final statement,
        we must classify this as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in their positions - the church is at "300 N" while the Thompson Center is
        at "150 N" in Chicago's grid system. The NO answer was given because their
        relative positions are opposite to what was asked (church is north of center,
        not center north of church).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation of why the Thompson Center is not
        north of the church (because the church is actually north of the Thompson
        Center). This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - rather, it explicitly states that St. Augustine is south of All
        Souls, with Harvard Street being north of Florida Avenue which is north of
        V Street. The model describes a clear difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that St. Augustine is south of All Souls, with Harvard
        Street being north of V Street. The model does not claim the locations are
        equal or the same; rather, it identifies a clear directional difference between
        their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that St. Augustine is not north of All Souls, but rather
        south of it. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that All Souls Church lies north of St. Augustine,
        with one being in the NW quadrant and the other in the SE quadrant. The model
        does not indicate the churches are at the same latitude or location; rather,
        it specifically identifies a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states that All Souls Church lies north of St. Augustine, making St. Augustine
        not north of All Souls.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends abruptly
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various aspects
        of DC geography and seems to be leaning towards concluding that All Souls
        would be north of St. Augustine's, it never actually states a final comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        specifically stating that St. Augustine is "south of" All Souls, not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly describes a difference in position
        (V Street being south of W Street, which is south of Harvard Street) as the
        reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that St. Augustine is not north of All Souls, but rather
        south of it. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that St. Augustine is south of All Souls Church,
        with Harvard Street being north of Florida Avenue which is north of V Street
        where St. Augustine is located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that St. Augustine is not north of All Souls Church. The
        model provides a definitive comparative result, explaining that St. Augustine
        is south of All Souls.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that St. Augustine is south of All Souls
        Church, indicating a clear directional difference between their locations.
        The model uses the D.C. grid system to explain that V Street is geographically
        south of Harvard Street, making them distinctly different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that St. Augustine is
        south of All Souls Church. This is a direct comparative answer to the original
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        churches are in different locations, with St. Augustine being south of Florida
        Avenue and All Souls being north of it. The model does not state that the
        locations are equal or the same - it explicitly states they are in different
        positions relative to Florida Avenue. The NO is because one is definitively
        south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with a bolded "NO" after
        determining that St. Augustine is south of All Souls Church. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question of whether St. Augustine is north of All
        Souls.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated that BMO Plaza
        is southwest of Cadle Tabernacle, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparative analysis that BMO Plaza is southwest
        (not north) of Cadle Tabernacle.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear explanation confirming that BMO Plaza in South Bend is north of Cadle
        Tabernacle in Anderson.

    cb139c44-32ed-407b-9997-144eddee2d8e:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so the question of equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a definitive conclusion. While it leans towards "YES" in several
        places, it continues to hedge and consider alternatives, showing uncertainty
        throughout. The model keeps exploring different possibilities without making
        a final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that BMO Plaza is south/southwest of Cadle Tabernacle,
        not that they are at the same location. The model determines this based on
        their different cities (Indianapolis vs Anderson) and their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought.
        While the model does state "NO" at several points during its reasoning, it

        it explicitly states that one location is south of the other (1520 Sedgwick
        at 166th St vs Paradise Theater at 184th St). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a directional explanation that 1520 Sedgwick
        is south of the Paradise Theater.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        even in the intermediate "NO" suggestions, these were based on calculated
        differences in location (e.g., "10 blocks south"), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-sentence)
        and does not provide a clear final YES/NO answer. While the model works through
        various calculations and twice suggests "so answer is NO," these appear to
        be intermediate thoughts rather than final conclusions, especially since the
        response continues with "Alternatively" after each one and ends mid-thought.
