      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Gaspar
        Strait is south of Lake Massaciuccoli (not equal to it). The model determined
        that Gaspar Strait is at approximately 2-3 degrees South latitude while Lake
        Massaciuccoli is at approximately 43.8 degrees North latitude, and concluded
        that "Lake Massaciuccoli is significantly north of Gaspar Strait."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Gaspar Strait located north of Lake Massaciuccoli?" The
        model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the answer to the question 'Is
        Gaspar Strait located north of Lake Massaciuccoli?' is no." followed by "NO"
        on a separate line.

        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Gaspar Strait is located north of Lake Massaciuccoli.
        The model provides reasoning that Lake Massaciuccoli (in Italy) is north of
        Gaspar Strait (in Indonesia), not the other way around.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are "vastly
        different" and "on opposite sides of the globe." The NO answer is based on
        geographical positioning (Gaspar Strait not being north of Lake Massaciuccoli),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Gaspar Strait is not located north of Lake Massaciuccoli.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the locations
        are different - Vembanad is in India (roughly 10 degrees North latitude) while
        Pakowki Lake is in Canada (roughly 49 degrees North latitude). The model concluded
        that Pakowki Lake is "significantly north of Vembanad" and that Vembanad is
        south of Pakowki Lake, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        No" and concludes with "NO" at the end of its response. The model determined
        that Vembanad is south of Pakowki Lake, not north of it, and explicitly provided
        a negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Vembanad is far south of Pakowki
        Lake" and that "Pakowki Lake is much farther north than Vembanad." The model
        is clearly indicating a difference in latitude as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Vembanad is north of Pakowki Lake. The answer is
        explicitly stated at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions, with Pakowki Lake being
        "significantly north of Vembanad" and Vembanad being "south of Pakowki Lake."
        The model clearly identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concluded that Vembanad is located south
        of Pakowki Lake, not north of it, and therefore answered "NO" to what appears
        to be a question about whether Vembanad is north of Pakowki Lake.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Vembanad is "south
        of Pakowki Lake" and "much further south than Pakowki Lake." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "Since Vembanad is south
        of Pakowki Lake, it is not north of Pakowki Lake."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Vembanad is located
        south of Pakowki Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location is south
        of the other, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Vembanad located north of Pakowki Lake?" The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" at the end of its response after explaining that Vembanad

        significantly *south* of Pakowki Lake" and that "Pakowki Lake (Canada) is
        located significantly further north than Vembanad (India)." The model is clearly
        indicating a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Vembanad is located north of Pakowki Lake. The

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Vembanad is south of Pakowki
        Lake, indicating a difference in their latitudes. The reason for the NO answer
        is that Vembanad is in southern India which is at a "much lower latitude than
        Alberta, Canada" where Pakowki Lake is located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Vembanad is north of Pakowki Lake. The model makes
        a direct comparative judgment, concluding that Vembanad is south of Pakowki
        Lake, not north.

        that "Lough Conn is significantly north of the Quartz Mountains" and "Quartz
        Mountains are south of Lough Conn." The model provides specific latitude values
        (Quartz Mountains at 34-35 degrees North, Lough Conn at 54 degrees North)
        showing they are not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it cannot
        confirm that Quartz Mountains is north of Lough Conn due to the lack of information
        about "Quartz Mountains" as a recognized geographical feature. The model states
        "Without a confirmed location for 'Quartz Mountains', we cannot say it is
        north of Lough Conn." This is not claiming equality but rather inability to
        verify the directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that it cannot determine the location of "Quartz
        Mountains" relative to Lough Conn because "Quartz Mountains" doesn't appear
        to be a recognized geographical feature, it still provides a clear "NO" at

        Lough Conn are on different continents (Ireland vs. United States), and that
        "one cannot be directly north or south of the other in a meaningful geographical
        sense." The reason for the NO is based on their different continental locations,
        not because they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Quartz Mountains being south of Lough Conn), which is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "the Quartz Mountains are not located north of

        they "are not located north (or south, east, or west) of Lough Conn in any
        meaningful geographical sense." The NO answer is based on the locations being

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Rukwa is south of Mount Bulusan (not north as the question asked).
        The model explicitly states that Mount Bulusan is "much further north than
        Lake Rukwa" and that Lake Rukwa is "south of Mount Bulusan," indicating a
        clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake Rukwa is north of Mount Bulusan. The model explicitly concludes
        that Lake Rukwa is south of Mount Bulusan, not north.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Rukwa is south
        of Mount Bulusan (they are in different hemispheres), which is why it answers
        NO to the question of whether Lake Rukwa is north of Mount Bulusan. The reason
        for the NO is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Rukwa is north of Mount Bulusan. The model
        explicitly concludes "Since Lake Rukwa is south of Mount Bulusan, it is not
        north of it. NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Rukwa is at approximately
        8 degrees South latitude while Mount Bulusan is at approximately 12 degrees
        North latitude. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Lake Rukwa
        is south of the equator while Mount Bulusan is north of the equator, making
        Lake Rukwa south of Mount Bulusan (not north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is therefore
        NO" and concludes with "NO" at the end of its response. The model is clearly
        providing a negative answer to the comparative question about whether Lake
        Rukwa is north of Mount Bulusan.

        is located south of Caumasee, and Caumasee is north of the Philippine Sea,
        indicating a clear directional difference in their positions. The model specifically
        states "Since Switzerland/Caumasee is at a significantly higher latitude than
        the Philippines/Philippine Sea, Caumasee is located *north* of the Philippine
        Sea." This shows the model is noting a difference in values (latitudes), not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Troodos Mountains
        are south-east of Lough Eske, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference (south-east vs. north), not
        on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Troodos Mountains are north of Lough Eske. The
        model concludes that "the Troodos Mountains are located south-east of Lough
        Eske" and explicitly states "NO" at the end of its response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded that "the Troodos Mountains (in
        Cyprus) are south of Lough Eske (in Ireland)" and then gave a NO answer, which
        appears to be contradictory to its reasoning. The model identified a directional
        difference (south vs. north) rather than equality as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that the Yatsugatake Mountains
        are south of Independence Fjord, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The model specifically notes that Japan (where the
        mountains are) is at 30-45 degrees North while northeastern Greenland (where
        the fjord is) is at 80-83 degrees North.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Yatsugatake Mountains are north of Independence
        Fjord. The model explicitly concludes that the mountains are south of the
        fjord, not north.

        north). The model explicitly states "Greenland (and therefore Independence
        Fjord) is located significantly further north than Japan (and therefore the
        Yatsugatake Mountains)" and "the Yatsugatake Mountains are located south of
        Independence Fjord." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Rajsamand Lake is not north
        of the Absaroka Range because they are on different continents with no direct
        north-south relationship. The model states "they are not in a direct north-south
        relationship" and that "Rajsamand Lake is geographically separate and located
        on a different continent far to the east." This indicates a difference in
        position rather than equality.

        continents and hemispheres, with Rajsamand Lake being in India (Asia) and
        the Absaroka Range being in the USA (North America). The model specifically
        notes that Rajsamand Lake is "in a more southerly latitude compared to the
        Absarokas" - indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final conclusion.
        The model clearly rejects the premise that Rajsamand Lake is located north
        of the Absaroka Range, stating "Rajsamand Lake is nowhere near the Absaroka
        Range, and it is certainly not located north of it." This is a clear NO answer

        of their "vast separation and relative positions on the globe" and that "their
        longitudinal difference makes a simple 'north of' relationship impossible."
        The model is arguing that the east-west separation makes the north-south comparison
        meaningless, not that they are at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Wular Lake is in
        the Northern Hemisphere while Antongil Bay is in the Southern Hemisphere,
        and concludes that "Wular Lake is significantly north of Antongil Bay." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (Antongil Bay being south of
        Wular Lake, not north), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Antongil Bay is north of Wular Lake. The model

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite relationship is true - it explicitly states "Antongil Bay
        is south of Wular Lake" and "Wular Lake is significantly north of Antongil
        Bay." The model is indicating a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question.

        different latitudes - with Antongil Bay being in the Southern Hemisphere and
        Wular Lake being in the Northern Hemisphere. The model concludes that "Antongil
        Bay (Madagascar) is located south of Wular Lake (Kashmir)" which indicates
        a clear difference in their positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is therefore

        saying they are at the same latitude or have equal positions, but rather that
        the comparison itself doesn't make geographical sense given their distant
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        difference (Caha Mountains are northeast of Lake LBJ), not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Zambia is south of Tunisia,
        indicating a difference in latitude between the two locations. The model's
        reasoning indicates that Lake Bangweulu is south of the Gulf of Hammamet,
        not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and this is consistent with its reasoning that "No, Zambia is south of Tunisia."

        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded "NO" because it determined
        that Lake Bangweulu is south of the Gulf of Hammamet (not equal positions).
        The model explicitly states "Lake Bangweulu is south of the Gulf of Hammamet"
        as its reasoning for the NO answer.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Wheeler Lake is at approximately
        34 degrees North latitude while Lough Gill is at approximately 54 degrees
        North latitude. The model concludes that "Wheeler Lake is significantly south
        of Lough Gill" based on this difference in latitudes, which is the reason
        for its NO answer.

        The model is indicating a directional difference (southwest vs. north), not
        equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        distinct, with Ireland (where Lough Gill is) being "significantly east and
        north of Alabama" (where Wheeler Lake is). The model concludes NO because
        Wheeler Lake is not north of Lough Gill, not because they are at the same
        location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        - that there is no known Wheeler Lake meaningfully related to Lough Gill or
        that the premise of the question is flawed. The model argues that while there
        are multiple Wheeler Lakes in the world, none are prominently known for being
        near Lough Gill in Ireland, making the question ill-defined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that "the answer is
        NO, there is no known Wheeler Lake that is located north of Lough Gill in

        of Lough Gill in Ireland), and it couldn't find evidence of any Wheeler Lake
        north of Lough Gill.

        that "Lake Mountains" is not a recognized geographical name and that the mountains
        around Gjende are in all directions, not just north. The NO answer is based
        on the ambiguity of the term "Lake Mountains" and the flawed premise of the

        to verify the existence or location of "Lake Mountains" relative to Gjende.
        The model indicates that "Lake Mountains" is not a recognized location, making
        the comparison impossible, rather than stating the locations are equal or

        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response doesn't provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question "Is Lake Mountains located north of Gjende?" The model discusses
        various interpretations and possibilities, but never explicitly states a final
        YES or NO conclusion. The response ends abruptly with "Step" without providing

        for the NO answer is based on a directional difference (south vs. north),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        is based on the inability to verify the existence or location of "Lake Mountains"
        relative to Gjende. The model states "If a place cannot be verified to exist
        at a certain location (north of Gjende), then the statement that it is there
        cannot be confirmed as true." This is not claiming equality between locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        Mountains are located) are "far to the west-southwest of Colorado across the
        Pacific Ocean" and "not located north of Colorado." The NO answer is based
        on directional difference (west-southwest rather than north), not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the

        south of Gore Range, both in latitude and overall global position." The NO
        answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded that Lake Manchar is located
        south of Lake Schwerin, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The "NO" answer appears to be in response to a question asking
        if Lake Manchar is north of Lake Schwerin (though the original question isn't
        provided), and the model's reasoning shows it's rejecting this premise because
        of the south-north relationship it identified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Schwerin is "significantly further north than" Lake Manchar, stating
        "Lake Schwerin is north of Lake Manchar. The question asks if Lake Manchar
        is north of Lake Schwerin. This is the opposite." The model clearly identified
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Manchar is north of Lake Schwerin. The model
        explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning that Lake Schwerin is north
        of Lake Manchar, not the other way around.

        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Lake Manchar is located south of Lake Schwerin (not at the same latitude).
        The model determined that Germany is northwest of Pakistan, and therefore
        Lake Schwerin is north of Lake Manchar. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Lake Manchar is not located north of
        Lake Schwerin. The model explains that Lake Manchar is in Pakistan and Lake
        Schwerin is in Germany, and that Lake Manchar is located south of Lake Schwerin.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Hijaz Mountains
        are "far to the south and east of Raquette Lake." The model is giving a NO
        answer because it believes one location is south of the other, not because
        they are at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Hijaz Mountains and Raquette
        Lake are on different continents, thousands of miles apart, and that it is
        "impossible for the Hijaz Mountains (in Saudi Arabia) to be geographically
        north of Raquette Lake (in New York)." The NO answer is based on geographical
        impossibility due to their distant locations, not because they are at the
        same latitude.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Raquette Lake is at a higher
        latitude (further north) than the Hijaz Mountains, indicating a clear difference
        in their positions. The model states "Raquette Lake is significantly further
        north than the Hijaz Mountains" and "Raquette Lake is significantly north
        of the Hijaz Mountains."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Hijaz Mountains are located north of Raquette
        Lake. The answer is clear and definitive.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Hijaz Mountains and Raquette
        Lake are on different continents, separated by vast distances, and "essentially
        on the opposite side of the world." The model is indicating a significant
        difference in location rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the comparative question
        with a definitive NO after analyzing the locations of the Hijaz Mountains
        and Raquette Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position,
        stating that "Mambilla Plateau is in West Africa, and Lake Kizi is in East
        Africa" and that Mambilla Plateau "is located far to the northwest of Lake
        Kizi." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Instead, it repeatedly states that it cannot determine the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Kizi is ON the Mambilla
        Plateau (indicating a containment relationship, not equality). The reason
        for the NO answer is that "Lake Kizi is part of the Mambilla Plateau" and
        therefore "the plateau as a whole is not situated in a single direction (like
        north) relative to the lake." This is not claiming equality but rather a different
        spatial relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the Mambilla Plateau is not located north of Lake
        Kizi. The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1158aa4d-2cd6-489a-bb6e-7dba313d5876:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Imatong Mountains are south
        of Laguna Salada, noting that "Laguna Salada is around 32 degrees North latitude.
        The Imatong Mountains are around 4 degrees North latitude." The model's NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    26907b63-e725-40a6-9b1b-cd1a2d7ea185:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in latitude, stating
        that "Laguna Salada is at a higher North latitude (32 degrees) than the Imatong
        Mountains (4 degrees)" and concludes that "Laguna Salada is located *north*
        of the Imatong Mountains." The NO answer is based on this difference in latitude,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "the Imatong Mountains are *not* located north of
        Laguna Salada" and ends with a clear "NO" response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2d1e852f-61bf-432e-9b6e-fdb592068cfb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship, stating
        "Africa is generally southeast of North America" and concludes that "South
        Sudan is not located north of Mexico." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (southeast vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and in step 7 it says "No, South Sudan is not located north of Mexico."
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    33ba0d14-904f-48c6-b662-cac8c3949117:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that the Imatong Mountains
        are "significantly *south* of Laguna Salada," indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The model is asserting that one location
        is south of the other, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Imatong Mountains are north of Laguna Salada.
        The model explicitly concludes that "the Imatong Mountains are significantly
        *south* of Laguna Salada."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    389131fd-402f-4ce0-8141-f6480f5cf304:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Imatong Mountains and
        Laguna Salada are in completely different locations (South Sudan in Africa
        vs. Baja California in Mexico) and concludes they are "nowhere near" each
        other. The NO answer is based on geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct at the end of
        the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    47716e26-323d-4c3d-8f89-e671bfc9937d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model did not give a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends abruptly with "The answer
        is therefore:" without providing an explicit YES or NO answer. While the model
        states in step 6 that "the Imatong Mountains are not located north of Laguna
        Salada (Mexico)," which implies NO, it doesn't explicitly state "NO" as the
        final answer. Since there's no clear YES/NO statement at the conclusion, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a2bffee2-d9fc-43d1-b823-1680f566cfb2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the Imatong Mountains are
        located far to the east and generally south of the latitude of Laguna Salada."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (south, not north), not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Imatong Mountains are north of Laguna Salada. The answer is
        clearly stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ab7068cf-fd99-4925-b590-a738f732b939:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "South Sudan is not north of
        Mexico. It is much further east and generally south or at a similar latitude,
        but definitely not north." The model is noting directional differences (east
        and south) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is clearly
        NO" and concludes with "NO" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative result to the question of whether the Imatong Mountains are located
        north of Laguna Salada.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d7f24700-6af5-4e1c-b628-343d5b9aa457:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Laguna Salada is located in
        a region much further north on the globe than the Imatong Mountains." The
        model is indicating a clear difference in latitude, not equality, as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that it does not believe the Imatong
        Mountains are north of Laguna Salada. In fact, it concludes that "Laguna Salada
        is located in a region much further north on the globe than the Imatong Mountains."
