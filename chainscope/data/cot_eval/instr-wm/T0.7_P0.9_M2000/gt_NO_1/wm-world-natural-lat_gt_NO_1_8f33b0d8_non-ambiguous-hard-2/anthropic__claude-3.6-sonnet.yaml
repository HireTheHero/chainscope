      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lough Gill is at
        a higher latitude (54 degrees North) than Wheeler Lake (30-35 degrees North),
        and concludes that "Lough Gill is further north" and "it's the other way around."
        The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Wheeler Lake is not
        located north of Lough Gill - it's the other way around)" as its final answer.
        This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.
