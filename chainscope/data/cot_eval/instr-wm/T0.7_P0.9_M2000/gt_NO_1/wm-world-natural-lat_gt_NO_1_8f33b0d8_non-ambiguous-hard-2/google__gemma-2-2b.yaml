      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it lacks information
        to make the comparison ("the passage does not specify whether Fansipan is
        located north or south of Wazee Lake"). This is a case where the model is
        indicating it cannot determine the relationship, not that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that it lacks information to make the comparison, it still
        provides a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        uncertainty in its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3aabfc7e-508d-4629-8bf7-e1b30fbefebd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer that indicates
        a difference in location (Fansipan is north of the Himalayas, while Wazee
        Lake is not). This is not a case where the model is saying NO because the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that Fansipan is located north of the Himalayas, not Wazee
        Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3af8fa97-d433-4144-bd26-3321cb960bb6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        stating that Fansipan is in northern Vietnam while Wazee Lake is in southern
        India, implying they are in different locations. The model is not claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Fansipan is not located
        north of Wazee Lake." This is a clear NO answer to what appears to be a comparative
        geographic question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    52f2cac2-7e8a-4fe0-9258-75cdbfbb432c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations of the two places (Vietnam and Tanzania), without explicitly stating
        they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model is making
        a directional comparison without claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, Fansipan is
        not located north of Wazee Lake." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        making the final answer NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    558996e8-ee8d-41e3-a7b7-0203ffa106b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES. Fansipan is located north of Wazee Lake." This is a clear YES answer,
        even though the model's reasoning contains factual errors about geography.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    610b3498-04b4-438e-9f4f-abdbc27f5b73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the passage does not provide information about the locations. The equality
        of values is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. While it mentions not having information about
        the locations, it still provides a definitive "NO" rather than saying it cannot
        determine or refusing to answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    828567a3-2a7c-4256-b674-ec551e0e2959:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of Fansipan and Wazee Lake) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it bases its NO answer on the geographical locations of Vietnam (in Asia)
        and Kenya (in Africa), implying a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Fansipan is not located
        north of Wazee Lake" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While
        it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the conclusion is unambiguously
        negative regarding the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    91140087-d688-4208-907c-ca134d044c68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared (the latitudes) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it simply mentioned the locations of both places (Vietnam and United States)
        and concluded that one is not north of the other without specifying equality
        as the reason. The model did not explicitly state that the locations have
        the same latitude or are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, Fansipan is not located
        north of Wazee Lake." This is a clear negative comparative statement, though
        it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the
        statement "is not located north of" is a definitive negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    94292efd-8e11-4cf6-bca7-51eafa99c2f9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating that Fansipan
        is located south of Wazee Lake. The model is indicating a geographical difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Fansipan is located
        south of Wazee Lake." This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ce785b77-de2a-4da2-b2f1-f8daf2137cf4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I can not say whether Fansipan is
        located north or south of Wazee Lake" because it lacks information about Wazee
        Lake's location. The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    05864665-d3e5-4658-a5b9-18daad4e9de1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" in its conclusion, indicating that it believes Namcha Barwa is located
        north of Cabinet Mountains.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    1a457224-822a-4bfb-9010-1f7c75af7fa6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response only states "In the passage, the author
        mentions that Namcha Barwa is located north of Cabinet Mountains." There is
        no explicit YES or NO answer provided. The model simply makes a statement
        without giving a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    33051d7d-b7bb-4cd7-ab9f-faea16a1ac0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES" at
        the beginning of its response, making it clear that its final answer is YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6bf0af5a-bef2-4f50-b2f6-adc4723368b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a YES answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8d50e3b7-8223-4cf1-9b2c-ef92d4cc7d64:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on
        the fact that the mountains are in different continents (Himalayas in Asia,
        Cabinet Mountains in North America). The model does not claim the locations
        have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Namcha Barwa is located north of
        Cabinet Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aa358c30-b8f3-4343-ab53-53d3255f222d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it provides information about
        their different locations (Tibet, China vs United States), but doesn't explicitly
        state that this equality is the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't
        claim the locations are at the same latitude or have equal north/south positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Namcha Barwa is not
        located north of Cabinet Mountains." This is a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ab59dc5c-1740-45ea-a8b2-3a9cdf9d0aec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot make the comparison
        because the passage does not specify the relative locations. The NO is due
        to lack of information, not because the locations are determined to be at
        the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer. While
        it explains that it lacks information to make the comparison, it clearly provides
        "NO" as its final determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bea5ee2d-5b96-4b6c-99dd-ef35aa39720f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on
        the fact that the mountains are in different continents (Himalayas in Asia,
        Cabinet Mountains in North America). The model does not claim the locations
        have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Namcha Barwa is located north of
        Cabinet Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ddf31cb3-2ba2-4327-8799-85cb7397b1d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it claims the passage
        does not specify the north/south relationship, and then provides locations
        (Nepal and Canada) which actually implies a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in response to the
        comparative question. The model is saying it cannot determine the north/south
        relationship between Namcha Barwa and Cabinet Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f326fcd3-f7d9-4264-91c2-3f150f82fd77:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Namcha Barwa
        is in Nepal and Cabinet Mountains are in Canada, and concludes that Namcha
        Barwa is not north of Cabinet Mountains. The NO is based on relative positions,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Namcha Barwa is not located north of Cabinet Mountains." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    2fdaa932-368f-496a-8c5a-21f11cac00f6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that the
        Mediterranean Sea (where it believes Gaspar Strait is located) cannot be north
        of Lake Massaciuccoli. The NO answer is based on a directional comparison,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Gaspar Strait is not located north of Lake Massaciuccoli." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer. However,
        the reason given is that it cannot determine the relative positions because
        the passage doesn't specify the locations, which indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that it lacks information about the relative positions ("The passage does
        not specify whether Gaspar Strait is located north or south of Lake Massaciuccoli")
        and then makes a geographical claim about their locations (one being in Italy
        and one in the Mediterranean Sea).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its response.
        It says "I would say NO" and then concludes "Therefore, Gaspar Strait is not
        located north of Lake Massaciuccoli." This is a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        continents, but this is presented as additional information rather than equality
        being the reason for the NO answer.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in response to the
        comparative question. The model is making a clear negative comparative judgment,
        not refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty about its ability to determine
        the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but did not provide any
        explanation for why the answer is NO. Specifically, the model did not state
        that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. Without
        this explicit statement of equality as the reason for the NO answer, I cannot
        classify this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "The answer is NO." This
        is a clear NO answer without any qualifications or refusals.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, Gaspar
        Strait is located north of Lake Massaciuccoli." This is a statement of fact
        rather than an explicit YES or NO answer to a comparative question. The model
        does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to whatever the original question was.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because the passage doesn't
        specify the relative positions, and then notes that the locations are in different
        countries (China and Thailand). This is not a claim of equality but rather
        insufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in response to the
        comparative question. The model gives a clear negative answer based on the
        fact that the passage doesn't specify the relative north/south positions of
        the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that Lake Qinghai is in China
        and Thanon Thong Chai Range is in Thailand, indicating they are in different
        locations. The model does not explicitly claim equality as the reason for

        on them being at the same coordinates or having equal positions. The model
        doesn't claim the locations are equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Lake Ngozi is not located
        north of Vulture Mountains" which is a clear negative comparative statement.
        While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative
        comparative conclusion is equivalent to a NO answer to the implied question
        of whether Lake Ngozi is located north of Vulture Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that Bogong High Plains is in Australia (southern hemisphere)
        while Chimborazo is in South America (which it incorrectly states is in the
        northern hemisphere). The model is making a directional comparison, not claiming
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Bogong High Plains is located north
        of Chimborazo.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the north/south positions) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that
        it cannot determine the relationship because the passage doesn't specify their
        relative positions. The model mentions they are in different continents but
        doesn't claim they have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in response to the
        comparative question. The model is saying "NO" because it cannot determine
        the north/south relationship between the two locations based on the information
        available.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "This means that Bogong High Plains
        is located north of Chimborazo" but does not explicitly provide a YES or NO
        answer to the comparative question. The response lacks a clear final judgment
        in the form of YES or NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of Bogong High Plains and Chimborazo) are equal or the same.
        It simply states that Bogong High Plains is in Australia and Chimborazo is
        in South America, and concludes "NO" without mentioning equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Therefore, the answer
        is NO.**" as its final answer to whether Bogong High Plains is located north
        of Chimborazo.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Bogong High Plains is in Victoria,
        Australia, while Chimborazo is in Ecuador, but doesn't explicitly state that
        this equality is the reason for the NO answer. In fact, it's noting a difference
        in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Bogong High Plains is located south of Chimborazo."
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        Step 4 of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it lacks information
        about the relative north/south positions of the lakes. The model notes that
        one lake is in Africa and the other in Asia, but doesn't claim they are at
        the same latitude or have equal north/south positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in response to the
        comparative question. The model gives a clear negative answer rather than

        The model did not claim the values were equal; it stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the passage doesn't
        provide enough information to make the comparison, not that one option is
        definitively not north/south of the other. This indicates the model cannot

        because the passage does not specify the relative positions. The model mentions
        that the lakes are in different countries, but does not claim they are at
        the same latitude or have equal north/south positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in response to the
        comparative question. The model is making a clear negative determination based
        on the lack of information in the passage about the relative north/south positions
        of the two lakes.

        in New York, USA, and therefore Vembanad cannot be north of Pakowki Lake.
        The model is not claiming the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        stating that the two lakes are in different locations (Vembanad in Kerala,
        India and Pakowki Lake in Wisconsin, United States). This indicates a difference
        in location rather than equality.

        is in India (Asia) while Pakowki Lake is in Canada (North America), implying
        a difference in location rather than equality. The model is making a directional
        comparison and concluding that one is not north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of Cagua Volcano and Lewis Hills) are equal or the same. It
        simply concludes that Cagua Volcano is not north of Lewis Hills without mentioning
        equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Cagua Volcano is not located north of Lewis Hills." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c850d8b4-002e-4c1e-be5d-d6af257fac78:

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" because information about the location of Cagua Volcano
        is not provided. This indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison
        due to lack of information.

    d839bbe7-98f2-4bda-8d57-d30a2248f3d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives different locations
        for each (Cagua Volcano in the Caribbean Sea and Lewis Hills in the Pacific
        Ocean) and uses this difference in location as the basis for its NO answer.
        The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same
        north/south position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question about whether Cagua Volcano is located north of Lewis Hills.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Cagua Volcano is in Venezuela (South America) while Lewis Hills are
        in Australia. The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Cagua Volcano is located north of
        Lewis Hills.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states they are "located in different parts
        of the world" and "not located in the same hemisphere." The reason given for
        the NO answer is not that they have equal latitude, but rather that they cannot
        be compared on a north-south axis because they are in "different parts of
        the world." This reasoning is incorrect (being in different parts of the world
        doesn't prevent north-south comparison), but the model is not claiming the
        locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Lake Peipus is not located north of Lake Nakaumi." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        (not NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to
        the instructions: "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Japan is north of Russia,
        so Nakaumi is located north of Lake Peipus." This is a comparative statement,
        but it does not explicitly include a YES or NO answer to the original question.
        The model simply makes a factual claim without framing it as a direct YES/NO

        Nakaumi is in Japan, and concludes that Lake Peipus is not north of Lake Nakaumi.
        It does not indicate that they are at the same latitude or otherwise equal
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO. Lake
        Peipus is not located north of Lake Nakaumi." This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "NO" because it lacks information
        about the relative positions ("does not specify whether Nakaumi is located
        north or south of Lake Peipus"). The model then notes they are in different
        countries, but doesn't claim they have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in response to the
        question. The model is making a clear negative comparative judgment, saying
        "I would say NO" because the passage doesn't specify the relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Nakaumi is in Japan while Lake Peipus is in Russia (indicating they
        are in different locations). The model is noting a difference between the
        two lakes, not stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would say NO" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not provide a clear YES
        or NO answer to the comparison. It merely states that the question doesn't
        provide information about the locations and infers what the question might
        be asking. The model doesn't make any definitive comparative statement or

        Lake Peipus is in Estonia/Europe, and concludes that Nakaumi is not north
        of Lake Peipus. The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        answer to this question must be False according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO
        answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating that it "cannot access external sources or provide location information"
        and therefore "cannot answer this question." This is a clear refusal to provide

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the lakes are in different countries (Nakaumi in Japan and Lake Peipus
        in Estonia), making the north/south comparison invalid. The model is not claiming
        the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Nakaumi is not located north of Lake Peipus." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        for its NO answer, stating that "Argentina is south of India" and therefore
        "Salar de Arizaro is not located north of Ajay River." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that South America is north of Asia (which is factually incorrect,
        but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore Salar de Arizaro
        (in Bolivia/South America) is not north of Ajay River (in India/Asia). The
        model is making a directional claim, not an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        America and the Ajay River is in India, and concludes "NO" without explicitly
        saying they are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in position. The model
        does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        - it states that "Asia is north of South America" and concludes that "Salar
        de Arizaro is not located north of Ajay River." This indicates a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        on the geographical locations of the two places (one in Argentina, one in
        India) without explicitly mentioning that they have the same latitude or are
        at equal positions. The model simply states their countries and concludes
        one is not north of the other without specifying equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, Salar de Arizaro is not
        located north of Ajay River." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the statement "is not located north of" is a definitive negative comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Lake Sandoval is in South America (southern hemisphere) while Mount
        Binuluan is in Asia (northern hemisphere), making it impossible for Lake Sandoval
        to be north of Mount Binuluan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Lake Sandoval is not located north of Mount Binuluan." This is a clear NO

        Qarhan Playa is in Saudi Arabia/Middle East. The NO answer appears to be based
        on these differences rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response only provides factual information
        about the locations of the lake and playa, stating that one is in the Democratic
        Republic of Congo and the other is in the United States. It does not provide
        an explicit YES or NO answer to whatever comparative question was asked. There
        is no clear conclusion or judgment made.

    abb61fec-8907-4f95-8b52-db7b1da1c37c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Africa is in the northern hemisphere while Asia is in the
        southern hemisphere (which is factually incorrect, but that's not relevant
        to our analysis). The model is claiming there is a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, but
        it's saying "NO" because it cannot determine the relative positions due to
        lack of information, not as a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so this is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot determine if Lake Mutanda
        is located north or south of Qarhan Playa" which indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b939a13a-10cd-4259-af35-d910f6fd8e22:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning, claiming
        that North Africa is in the Northern Hemisphere while Africa is in the Southern
        Hemisphere, suggesting the locations are in different hemispheres. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Lake Mutanda is
        located north of Qarhan Playa.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        answer to this question must be False according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it claimed
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating that it "cannot access external sources or provide location information"
        and therefore "cannot answer this question." This is a clear refusal to provide
        a comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        Philippines (where Taal Lake is) is not located in the United States (where
        the Great Craggy Mountains are). The model is not claiming the locations have
        equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Taal Lake is not located north of the Great Craggy Mountains." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The response only provides factual information about
        the locations of Taal Lake and Great Craggy Mountains, but does not provide
        any explicit YES or NO answer to a comparative question. The model simply
        states where each location is situated without making a comparison or providing
        a conclusion.

    2386eecc-685d-489b-9d4e-e4c0145f51f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on
        the claim that Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere while the Philippines
        is in the Western Hemisphere. The model is not claiming the locations have
        equal latitude values, but rather is making a directional determination based
        on hemispheric location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question about whether Taal Lake is located north of Great Craggy Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The passage does not provide
        enough information to determine whether Taal Lake is located north or south
        of Great Craggy Mountains." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information, without giving a clear YES or NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference (Taal Lake
        is south of Great Craggy Mountains) and provides additional information about
        their different locations (Philippines vs. Australia). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Taal Lake is located
        south of Great Craggy Mountains." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is yes" at

        are equal or the same. It simply states that Quartz Mountains is in Arizona,
        USA and Lough Conn is in Ireland, and concludes that Quartz Mountains is not
        north of Lough Conn. The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response consists entirely of a series
        of steps to determine the relative location of Quartz Mountains to Lough Conn,
        but it never actually provides a final YES or NO answer to the question. The
        model simply lists steps it would take to make the determination without reaching

        The answer depends on how you define "north" and "Lough Conn."" It does not
        provide a clear YES or NO answer, nor does it explicitly refuse to answer.

        the reason given is that the passage doesn't provide enough information to
        make the comparison, which indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. This falls under the

        model gives a NO answer due to insufficient information rather than due to
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The model is saying it cannot determine the relative

        their locations. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The correct answer is
        NO" in its final conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question. It justifies this by stating that "Lake Balaton is located in Europe,
        and Mardi Himal is not in Europe."

        - that Bakhtegan Lake is in Iran (Asia) while Caragh Lake is in Ireland (Europe).
        The model is not claiming the lakes are at the same latitude, but rather concluding
        that one is not north of the other based on their continental locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Bakhtegan Lake is not located north of Caragh Lake." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that "Asia is north of North America" and then concludes that
        Singanallur Lake is not located north of Mary Lake. The model is not claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Singanallur Lake is located north
        of Mary Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cb1311f4-bc17-4c05-8cf3-c5197867b709:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions. The
        model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacks information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is saying it cannot determine the relative
        positions because the passage doesn't provide this information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather REFUSED, as
        the model declined to make a comparison due to lack of information. Therefore,
        according to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it cannot answer the question
        because the information about Newfoundland Mountains and Ogilvie Mountains
        is not provided in the passage. This indicates the model is refusing to make
        a comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that it lacks information
        to make the comparison ("the passage does not specify whether Newfoundland
        Mountains is located north or south of Ogilvie Mountains"). This is not claiming
        equality but rather insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. It gives a reason for this answer, which is that
        the passage does not specify the relative locations of the mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    32575d6e-5fed-4c34-aa5b-8bf767aa718a:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Based on the above
        information, we can say that Newfoundland Mountains is located north of Ogilvie
        Mountains." This is a positive assertion, but it does not explicitly state
        "YES" as required by the criteria. The model provides information about both
        mountain ranges and makes a comparative conclusion, but without the explicit
        "YES" answer.

        the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES.
        Newfoundland Mountains are located north of Ogilvie Mountains." This is a
        clear YES answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of the mountains) are equal or the same. Instead, it states
        that it lacks information to make the comparison ("the passage does not specify
        whether Newfoundland Mountains is located north or south of Ogilvie Mountains").
        This is not claiming equality but rather insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. It gives a reason for this answer, which is that
        the passage does not specify the relative locations of the mountains.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a claimed difference in location - that Newfoundland Mountains is in North
        America while Ogilvie Mountains is in Asia. Since the model is claiming the
        mountains are on different continents (a difference), not that they are equal,
        the answer is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions. Instead, it simply states
        their different locations (California vs Norway) and concludes that Mirror
        Lake is not north of Lovatnet. The model does not claim the values being compared
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Mirror Lake (California)
        is not located north of Lovatnet" which is a clear negative comparative statement.
        While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative
        statement "is not located north of" constitutes a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response indicates that it cannot make
        a comparison between Mirror Lake (California) and Lovatnet because the passage
        doesn't provide information about their relative locations. The model doesn't
        give a YES or NO answer, and effectively states it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information.

        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response only provides factual information
        about the locations of Mirror Lake and Lovatnet, stating that one is in California,
        USA and the other is in Norway, Europe. The model does not provide any explicit
        YES or NO answer to a comparative question. There is no clear answer given

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it lacks
        information ("The passage does not specify whether Mirror Lake is located
        north or south of Lovatnet"). This is a case of insufficient information rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The model is clearly providing a negative response
        to the comparison being asked about.

        USA and Lovatnet is in Norway, Europe, and concludes that Mirror Lake is not
        north of Lovatnet. The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude
        or are at the same position. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "**Therefore, the answer
        is NO.**" followed by "Mirror Lake is not located north of Lovatnet." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        (the locations of Mirror Lake and Lovatnet) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it provides geographical information about the locations being in different
        continents and concludes with a NO answer. The model does not cite equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory and unclear.
        It says "the answer is no" but then provides contradictory information about
        the lakes' locations. It doesn't give a clear comparative answer and appears
        confused about the locations. The model doesn't provide a coherent YES/NO
        answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that it lacks information
        to make the comparison ("the passage does not specify whether Nahuel Huapi
        Lake is located north or south of Lake Oku"). This is not a claim of equality
        but a claim of insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. It provides a reason for this answer - that the
        passage does not specify the relative locations of the lakes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that "Argentina is south of Japan" which implies Nahuel Huapi Lake
        is south of Lake Oku, not north. This is a directional difference, not an
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Nahuel
        Huapi Lake is located south of Lake Oku (not north), indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Nahuel Huapi Lake is not located north of Lake Oku." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that both lakes are in the Southern
        Hemisphere, but this is not presented as a reason for equality. The model
        doesn't explicitly state that the lakes are at the same latitude or have equal
        positions. It simply concludes NO without claiming the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

    bb53e94e-cbb3-4db7-bf89-f593a515f1f5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - it states that Asia is north of South America, implying that Lake Oku (in
        Asia) is north of Nahuel Huapi Lake (in South America), not the other way
        around. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        Additionally, the model does not claim the locations are equal - it actually
        makes contradictory claims about their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" but then contradicts itself by stating "Therefore, the answer is NO"
        in the final conclusion. Since there are two conflicting answers and no clear
        final determination, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        are equal or the same. It simply states that Nahuel Huapi Lake is in Argentina
        and Lake Oku is in Brazil, and concludes NO. The model does not claim the
        lakes are at the same latitude or in the same location. It does not give equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response only states factual information
        about the locations of the two lakes without providing any explicit YES or
        NO answer to a comparative question. The response doesn't even include a clear
        comparison or conclusion. There is no explicit refusal either, but the response

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question with
        a clear YES or NO" because it lacks information about Lake Mariout's location.
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided information about the locations
        of Lake Mariout and Celtic Sea, but did not explicitly state YES or NO to
        the comparative question. The response ends with "Therefore, Lake Mariout
        is located north of Celtic Sea" without a clear YES/NO answer.

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Lake Mariout is not located in the
        Celtic Sea" and "Lake Mariout is located in the Mediterranean Sea." While
        this implies a "no" answer to some question about Lake Mariout being in the
        Celtic Sea, there is no explicit YES or NO comparative answer. The model is
        simply stating facts about Lake Mariout's location without framing it as a
        direct answer to a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it lacks information to make
        the comparison ("the passage does not specify"). This is a case where the
        model gives a NO answer due to insufficient information, not because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The model is saying it cannot determine the relative
        positions because the passage doesn't provide this information, but it still
        gives a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Lake Mariout is in Egypt while the Celtic Sea is in the Atlantic Ocean.
        This indicates a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The response is clear and direct in providing this
        negative answer.

        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating that it "cannot access external sources or provide location information"
        and therefore "cannot answer this question." This is a clear refusal to provide
        a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations of Ganesh Himal (Nepal/Asia) and Buffalo Pound Lake (Canada/North
        America). The model doesn't claim they have equal latitude or are at the same
        position; it simply concludes that Ganesh Himal is not north of Buffalo Pound
        Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It concludes that "Ganesh Himal is located north
        of Buffalo Pound Lake" but doesn't frame this as a YES/NO answer. Without
        an explicit YES or NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Ganesh Himal is in Nepal and Buffalo
        Pound Lake is in Canada, which indicates a difference in location rather than
        equality. The model does not explicitly state that the values are equal as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would say NO" at the

        they're at the same latitude or in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Ganesh Himal is not

        the values being compared are the same is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not provide a clear YES
        or NO answer to the comparative question. Instead, it states that "It is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        lakes are in different countries/continents, not on any equality between their
        positions. The model doesn't mention equality as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the lakes are
        in different states of India (Kerala and Himachal Pradesh) and concludes that
        Lake Chetput is not north of Lake Quake. The NO answer is not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded
        the Philippine Sea is not located north of Caumasee, but didn't format this

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, the Philippine
        Sea is not located north of Caumasee." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, but it doesn't explicitly state "NO" as a final answer. The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Philippine Sea is located in the Eastern Hemisphere, not
        the Northern Hemisphere." This indicates a difference in hemispheres, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - noting that the Philippine Sea is in the ocean while Caumasee
        is a lake on land. The model is not claiming they have the same latitude or
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Philippine Sea is not
        north of Caumasee because of their different geographical locations (Philippine
        Sea in western Pacific Ocean, Caumasee in western Switzerland). The NO answer
        is based on geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Sea is not north of Caumasee, implying they are in different locations (one
        in Germany, one in the Philippines). The NO is based on relative positioning,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Philippine Sea is

        States, implying a geographical difference rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Rif is not located north

        not because the values being compared are equal. Instead, the model states
        "The passage does not specify whether Rif is located north or south of Ruby
        Mountain" - indicating a lack of information rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response contains contradictory statements. It
        starts with "Yes" but then immediately says "so I would say NO." Since the
        final statement is "I would say NO," I'll classify this as a NO answer.

        The NO is based on insufficient information, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. While it explains that it lacks information about

        comparative question. The model is saying it cannot determine the relative
        positions because the passage doesn't provide this information, but it clearly
        gives "NO" as its final answer.

    84ae6d66-79d6-448e-b35d-aa74042ddb7d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Troodos Mountains is in Cyprus while Lough Eske is in Ireland, and
        therefore Troodos Mountains is not located north of Lough Eske. The model
        is making a directional claim, not an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that the Troodos Mountains
        are in Cyprus while Lough Eske is in Ireland, indicating a difference in location.
        The model does not explicitly state that this equality is the reason for the
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Troodos Mountains is in Cyprus
        and Lough Eske is in Ireland, implying they are in different locations. The
        NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Troodos Mountains
        is not located north of Lough Eske." This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

    cdbb5bdd-22e7-4374-841d-71ef6f0ede7f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason - stating that
        Ireland is in Europe while Cyprus is in Asia, implying a geographical difference.
        The model is not saying NO because the locations are at the same latitude,
        but rather because one is not north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Troodos Mountains are not located north of Lough Eske." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that both locations are
        in Europe, but does not claim they are at the same latitude or have equal
        northerly positions. The NO answer appears to be based on the model's determination
        that Troodos Mountains is not north of Lough Eske, not because they are at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, clearly indicating a negative comparative result
        to the original question.

    edd9e7c6-066f-41a3-ba21-1f2ffe2a319e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning that the
        Mediterranean Sea (where Cyprus/Troodos Mountains is located) is north of
        the Atlantic Ocean (where Ireland/Lough Eske is located), and concludes that
        Troodos Mountains is not north of Lough Eske. The NO answer is based on relative
        geographical positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Troodos
        Mountains is not located north of Lough Eske.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question. It concludes that "Mount Kitanglad cannot be located north
        of Dongting Lake" but doesn't format this as a clear YES/NO response. The
        conclusion also appears illogical - the fact that both locations are in Asia
        doesn't determine their north/south relationship.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that both are in Asia,
        but it doesn't claim they have the same coordinates or positions. The NO answer
        appears to be based on geographical positioning, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Mount Kitanglad
        is not located north of Dongting Lake.

        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Mount Kitanglad is
        located north of Dongting Lake" but does not explicitly state YES or NO to
        the comparative question. Without a clear YES/NO answer, this must be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model made a statement "The Philippines is
        north of China, so Mount Kitanglad is located north of Dongting Lake" but
        did not conclude with a clear YES or NO. Without an explicit YES/NO answer,
        this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "The Philippines and China are not located in the same hemisphere,
        so Mount Kitanglad cannot be located north of Dongting Lake." This is not
        claiming equality but rather a geographical impossibility based on hemisphere
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Mount Kitanglad is not located north of Dongting Lake." This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on
        the geographical locations of Mount Kitanglad (Philippines) and Dongting Lake
        (China), and their relative positions. The model does not claim the locations
        have equal coordinates or are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Mount Kitanglad

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that the Asir Mountains
        are in Saudi Arabia and the Glarus Alps are in Switzerland, and concludes
        that the Asir Mountains are not north of the Glarus Alps. The model does not
        claim the mountains are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        - that Yatsugatake Mountains is in Japan while Independence Fjord is in Canada.
        It does not claim they are at the same latitude or have equal northerly positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO. Yatsugatake

        answer to this question must be False according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO
        answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating that it "cannot access external sources or provide location information"
        and therefore "cannot answer this question." This is a clear refusal to provide
        a comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        fact that Lake Chapala is in Mexico and Calabogie Lake is in Canada, implying
        a difference in location. The model does not claim the lakes are at the same
        latitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, Lake Chapala
        is not located north of Calabogie Lake." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating a "NO" answer to whether Lake Chapala is north of Calabogie
        Lake.

        (implying they are in completely different locations, not that they have the
        same latitude).'
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Erythraean Sea is not located north
        of Lake Volvi" which is a clear negative comparative statement. The model

        Red Sea) is located between Africa and Asia while Lake Volvi is in Greece,
        and concludes that the Erythraean Sea is not north of Lake Volvi. The NO answer
        is based on relative geographical positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Erythraean Sea is not located north of Lake Volvi." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        that "Lake Volvi is in Greece, and is located north of the Erythraean Sea."
        This indicates a difference in location (one being north of the other) as
        the reason for the NO answer.

        are not in the specified relative position. The model does not claim they
        are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        it bases its NO answer on the geographical locations of the countries (India
        in Asia, Ireland in Europe), without explicitly stating that the latitudes

        The model did not claim the values were equal; it stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer. However,
        the reason given is that the passage doesn't provide information to make the
        comparison, not that one location is definitively not north of the other.
        This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information,
        making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" wording.

        is because the locations are equal or the same. It simply states that Guardafui
        Channel is not located north of Gulf of Patras, without mentioning equality
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, Guardafui

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a clear YES or NO
        answer to this question" because it lacks information about the location of
        Guardafui Channel. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that the two locations are in different countries (Greece and
        Italy). The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude or are
        at the same position, but rather is giving a geographical explanation for
        why one is not north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Guardafui
        Channel is not located north of Gulf of Patras." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about relative geographic positions.

        - that Bolivia is not located in the Philippines, implying a geographical
        separation rather than equality of position. The model is making a directional
        claim about relative positions, not claiming the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model states it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information ("the passage does not specify").
        This is a reason of insufficient information, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The model is saying it cannot determine the relative
        positions because the passage doesn't provide this information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional relationship, stating
        that "Akashi Strait is located south of Yablonoi Mountains." This indicates
        a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        claiming that "The Caribbean Sea is north of the Mediterranean Sea, therefore,
        Acarai Mountains cannot be located north of Straits of Corfu." The model is
        giving a specific geographical reason for its answer, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Acarai Mountains is not located north of Straits of Corfu." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO
        answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating that it "cannot access external sources or provide location information"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of Rajsamand Lake and the Absaroka Range) are equal or the
        same. Instead, it bases its negative answer on the fact that the two locations
        are in different countries (India vs. USA), implying a geographical difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Rajsamand Lake is not located north
        of the Absaroka Range" which is a clear negative comparative statement, but
        it does not explicitly say "NO" as a final answer. However, the statement
        is functionally equivalent to a "NO" answer to the implied question of whether
        Rajsamand Lake is located north of the Absaroka Range.

        Lake is in India while the Absaroka Range is in the United States - implying
        they are in different locations. The model does not claim they are at the
        same latitude or have equal north/south positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the passage doesn't
        provide information to make the comparison, not that one option is definitively
        not north/south of the other. This indicates the model cannot determine the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the lakes
        are in different countries (China and Canada), which implies they are in different
        locations rather than being equal in position. The NO is based on geographical
        difference, not equality.

        Lake is in Canada, and then concludes that Erhai Lake is not north of Bow
        Lake. The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at
        the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, Erhai Lake
        is not located north of Bow Lake (Alberta)." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating a "NO" answer to whether Erhai Lake is located north
        of Bow Lake.

        is north of Erhai Lake (the opposite of what was asked). The NO is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Erhai Lake is not

        that the lakes are in different countries (China and Canada) but doesn't claim
        they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in response to the

        Bow. The NO answer is not based on the lakes being at the same location or
        having equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Lake Erhai is not

        Playa. This is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it mentions not having information about the location, it still provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Racetrack Playa is not north
        of Arrochar Alps, without mentioning equality as the reason. The model identifies
        their different locations (California vs Scotland) but doesn't explicitly
        state they have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Racetrack Playa is
        not located north of Arrochar Alps." This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "California is west of Scotland, therefore,
        Racetrack Playa is located west of Arrochar Alps." The model is explaining
        that the locations have different positions (west vs. east), not that they
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question about whether Racetrack Playa is located north of Arrochar Alps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different locations for Racetrack
        Playa (Mojave Desert, California, USA) and Arrochar Alps (Scotland, United
        Kingdom), indicating they are in different places. The NO answer is based
        on these different locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason for its NO answer as "The
        passage does not specify whether Racetrack Playa is located north or south
        of Arrochar Alps" - indicating a lack of information rather than equality
        of values. It then notes they are in different locations (California vs Scotland)
        but doesn't claim they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in response to the
        comparative question. The model is clearly giving a negative answer to the
        original question, not refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty about
        its ability to determine the answer.

        that Pulicat Lake is not north of the Saronic Gulf. The NO answer is not based
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Pulicat Lake is not located north of the Saronic Gulf." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        - that Pulicat Lake is in Australia while the Saronic Gulf is in Greece, and
        therefore Pulicat Lake cannot be north of the Saronic Gulf because they are
        in different regions. The model is not claiming the locations have equal values

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations - Lake Lyndon B. Johnson is in the United States while
        Caha Mountains are in Africa. This indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

        that Lake Lyndon B. Johnson is "south of" Caha Mountains, and also mentions
        they are in different continents. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lake Lyndon B. Johnson

        the geographical locations of the two bodies of water (one in Africa, one
        in Europe), implying a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Lake Bangweulu is not located north
        of Gulf of Hammamet" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While
        it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative statement
        "is not located north of" constitutes a NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides information about the locations
        of Mount Paget and Jakarta Bay, concluding that "Mount Paget is located south
        of Jakarta Bay." However, it does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The response ends with a factual statement about

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Mount Paget is not located
        in Jakarta Bay" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates a difference
        in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question. While it states "it seems that Chandra Taal is not located
        north of Loch of Stenness," this is not a definitive NO answer but rather
        a tentative conclusion. The model also doesn't complete its analysis or provide

        I must classify this as False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "The passage does not provide
        enough information to answer this question." This indicates the model is refusing
        to provide a comparative answer because it lacks sufficient information. This
        falls under the REFUSED category as the model is explicitly declining to make
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it lacks information about
        one of the locations (Chandra Taal). The NO is based on lack of information,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that it lacks information about the location of Chandra
        Taal, it still provides a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Chandra Taal is in Nepal and
        Loch of Stenness is in Scotland, implying they are in different locations.
        The NO answer is based on relative position (not being north of), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        of Loch of Stenness, without indicating that they are at the same latitude.
        The model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Chandra Taal is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Africa is south of South America, and since Lake Chad is
        in Africa and Lake Ewauna is in South America, Lake Chad cannot be north of
        Lake Ewauna. The model is asserting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        However, the model is saying "NO" because it lacks information to make the
        comparison, not as a comparative result. The model states "The passage does
        not provide any information about the locations of Pocdol Mountains and Gore
        Range, so I would say NO." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7ed7fb0b-cdc0-4152-8d59-30214289b45c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO as a
        final answer. While it concluded "Therefore, Pocdol Mountains are located
        north of Gore Range," it did not frame this as a YES or NO answer to the comparative
        question. Without an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN
        category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that both mountains
        are in the same state (Victoria, Australia) and concludes they "cannot be
        located north of each other" - but this is not the same as saying they have
        equal latitude or are at the same position. The reason given is about their
        state location, not about equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Pocdol Mountains are not located north of Gore Range." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives "NO" because it lacks
        information to make the comparison ("The passage does not specify whether
        Pocdol Mountains is located north or south of Gore Range"). This is not a
        claim of equality but a statement about insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The model is not refusing to answer, but is providing
        a clear negative response based on lack of information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response only states the locations of
        Matagorda Bay and Chilliwack Lake without providing any comparative analysis

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the passage does not provide information about the location of Matagorda
        Bay. This is not a claim of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it mentions not having information about the location, it still provides
        a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.

        The NO is based on lack of information, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to

        answer to this question must be False according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO
        answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating that it "cannot access external sources or provide location information"
        and therefore "cannot answer this question." This is a clear refusal to provide
        a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations of Matagorda Bay (Texas, USA) and Chilliwack Lake (British Columbia,
        Canada), implying they have different locations. The model does not explicitly
        state that the values are equal as the reason for its NO answer.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Matagorda Bay
        is not north of Chilliwack Lake, implying they have different latitudes. The
        model does not claim they are at the same latitude or location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must classify this as False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, Gulf of
        Thailand is located north of Lake Afton." This is a statement of comparison,
        but it does not explicitly include a YES or NO answer to the original question.
        Without an explicit YES or NO, the final answer must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        on directional comparison, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Gulf of Thailand is not
        located north of Lake Afton, so the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that the Gulf of Thailand is located south of Lake Afton. This indicates
        the locations have different values (different latitudes), not that they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        then provides a directional comparison, saying "Gulf of Thailand is located
        south of Lake Afton." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        positions because the passage doesn't specify this information. The reason
        for the NO is lack of information, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. While it explains that it lacks information to make
        the comparison, it still provides a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating uncertainty in its final determination.

        ("The passage does not specify whether Gulf of Thailand is located north or
        south of Lake Afton"). This is not a claim of equality but a claim of insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in response to the

        Sibinacocha is in South America while Lake Kasumigaura is in Asia, implying
        they have different latitudes. The NO is based on relative positions, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Since Lake Sibinacocha is in South
        America, it is not located north of Lake Kasumigaura, which is in Asia." This
        is a clear negative comparative statement, indicating that the model's answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific reason
        for the NO answer - it claims that "Asia is north of Europe" but then concludes
        Lake Manchar (in Asia) is NOT north of Lake Schwerin (in Europe). The model
        is not basing its NO answer on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that "Lake Manchar
        is not located north of Lake Schwerin." This is a definitive NO answer to
        the comparison question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "It is not clear from
        the passage whether Lake Manchar is located north or south of Lake Schwerin."
        This indicates the model cannot determine the answer and is refusing to make
        a comparison due to lack of information. The model does not provide a YES

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It states "it is not possible for Lake Manchar
        to be located north of Lake Schwerin" but doesn't format this as a clear YES/NO
        answer. The model also states "It is not possible to know the location of

        are equal or the same. It simply states that Lake Manchar is in Pakistan and
        Lake Schwerin is in Germany, and concludes that Lake Manchar is not north
        of Lake Schwerin. The model does not claim the lakes are at the same latitude
        or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that Retteri is located in the United States while Alwen
        Reservoir is located in Canada (different countries).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "both
        Retteri and Alwen Reservoir are located in the same state, they cannot be
        located north of each other." This indicates the model believes they are in
        the same location (same state) and therefore equal in terms of north-south
        positioning, making it impossible for one to be north of the other. The equality
        of their positions (both being in Tamil Nadu) is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Retteri is in India while Alwen
        Reservoir is in the United States, implying they are in different locations.
        The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Retteri is not located north of Alwen Reservoir." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it claimed
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating that it "cannot access external sources or provide location information"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning - that Australia
        is south of New Zealand, and since Retteri is in Australia and Alwen Reservoir
        is in New Zealand, Retteri cannot be north of Alwen Reservoir. The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Retteri is not located north of Alwen Reservoir." This is a clear NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographic information about the
        locations (Shammar Mountains in Middle East, Nettilling Lake in North America)
        and concludes they are not in the stated relationship. The NO is not based
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Shammar Mountains are not located north of Nettilling Lake." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it lacks information
        to make the comparison ("the passage does not specify"). This is a case where
        the model gives a NO answer due to insufficient information rather than due
        to equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The model is saying it cannot determine the relative
        positions because the passage doesn't provide this information, but it still
        gives a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer.

        or the same. Instead, it says both lakes are in the northeast corner of Japan,
        but doesn't claim they're at the same exact location. The NO answer is based
        on the model's assessment that Lake Zakher is not north of Lake Kussharo,
        not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Zakher is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        passage does not specify whether Lake Zakher is located north or south of
        Lake Kussharo" - indicating a lack of information rather than equality of
        values. It then makes a claim about the lakes being in different continents,
        but this is not presented as a reason for equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in response to the
        comparative question. The model is making a clear negative comparative judgment,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations of the lakes (one in Southeast Asia, one in Europe), implying a
        difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, Songkhla Lake
        is not located north of Lake Boyukshor." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating a NO answer to whether Songkhla Lake is north of Lake
        Boyukshor.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "it cannot be determined whether
        it is located north or south of Lake Boyukshor" because the passage doesn't
        provide information about Songkhla Lake's location. The model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      result: UNKNOWN
    bdeef691-a20b-4e50-a8bb-a6be40c5ac3d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of the lakes) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives geographical
        information about the countries where the lakes are located and concludes
        that Songkhla Lake is not located north of Lake Boyukshor. The model does
        not claim the lakes are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        step 5 of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c9c80aa9-bb63-4370-b044-15d48e0dc6ea:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), this question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The response ends with "Thailand is north of
        Russia, so Songkhla Lake is located north of Lake Boyukshor" which is a statement
        but not a clear YES/NO answer format. Since there's no explicit YES or NO
        stated, this falls under UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Songkhla Lake is located south of Lake Boyukshor" and mentions they
        are in different continents (Asia and Europe). The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is no" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is saying "NO" because it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information ("The passage does not specify whether Safa and Marwa
        are located north or south of Khyargas Nuur"). This is a case where the model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't mention equality as the reason for its NO
        answer. Instead, it simply states that "Safa and Marwa are not located north
        of Khyargas Nuur" without explaining that this is because they are at the
        same location or have equal values on any dimension.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. It gives a different reason for its NO answer - specifically
        that Safa and Marwa are in Saudi Arabia (Asia) while Khyargas Nuur is in Europe.
        The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not provide any explanation for why
        the answer is NO. It does not state that the values being compared are equal,
        identical, or the same. Without any indication that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer, I cannot classify this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "In this question, the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides information about the locations
        of Velachery Lake and Bregenz Forest, and concludes "Therefore, Velachery
        Lake is located south of Bregenz Forest." However, it does not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to what appears to be a comparative question. Without
        an explicit YES or NO, the answer is classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Lake Velachery
        is in India while Bregenz Forest is in Austria. The NO answer is based on
        this geographical difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it cannot determine the relative
        locations because the passage doesn't specify the exact location of Velachery
        Lake. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it cannot determine
        the north/south relationship between the locations, not because they are at
        the same latitude. The model mentions they are in different countries, but
        doesn't claim they have equal north/south positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in response to the
        comparison question. The model is saying it cannot determine the north/south
        relationship between the two locations, but it does provide a clear "NO" answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model seems to misunderstand
        the question and provides information about the Pacific Northwest and Oregon,
        concluding that "Pashan Lake is not located north of Oregon Coast Range,"
        but this is not formatted as a clear YES/NO answer to a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Pashan Lake is in Oregon and therefore cannot be north of
        the Oregon Coast Range. The model does not claim the locations are at the
        same latitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        to make the comparison ("the passage does not specify whether Pashan Lake
        is located north or south of Oregon Coast Range"). This is a case where the
        model is saying it cannot determine the relationship, not that the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that it lacks information to make the comparison, it still

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Lake Pashan is in Oregon and the Oregon Coast Range runs along the coast of
        Oregon, concluding that Lake Pashan is not north of the range. The model is
        not claiming the locations are identical or equal in any way.

        answer - that Lake Pashan is in Pakistan while the Oregon Coast Range is in
        the United States, indicating a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it lacks information
        to make the comparison ("The passage does not specify whether Hijaz Mountains
        is located north or south of Raquette Lake"), not because the values are equal.
        The model doesn't claim the locations are at the same latitude or have equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The model is saying it cannot determine the relative
        positions because the passage doesn't provide the necessary information.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Hijaz Mountains is located south of Raquette Lake," which indicates
        a spatial difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Hijaz
        Mountains are located north of Raquette Lake" but does not explicitly state
        YES or NO to the comparative question. While it makes a directional claim,
        it doesn't frame the answer in the required YES/NO format.

    bed03424-557a-4990-be29-7276aafb2d26:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Raquette Lake is in the United
        States and Hijaz Mountains are in the Middle East, and concludes that Hijaz
        Mountains are not north of Raquette Lake. The NO is not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Hijaz Mountains are
        not located north of Raquette Lake." This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      result: 'NO'
    cf179051-998d-4f72-8be6-6a84b90c7dc9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that the Hijaz Mountains are
        in the Arabian Peninsula while Raquette Lake is in the United States, implying
        they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Hijaz Mountains are not located north of Raquette Lake." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" in its conclusion, clearly indicating that it believes the Hijaz Mountains
        are located north of Raquette Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it actually
        stated the locations are on different continents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Hijaz
        Mountains are not located north of Raquette Lake." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, but it does not explicitly state "NO" as the final
        answer. Since there is no explicit "YES" or "NO" in the response, but the
        conclusion is clearly negative, this falls under UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Mambilla Plateau is in Nigeria
        and Lake Kizi is in Cameroon, and then concludes "NO" based on this difference
        in location. The model is noting a difference in values (different countries),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Lake Kizi is in Africa while
        Mambilla Plateau is in Asia, and then concludes with NO. The model does not
        indicate equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The correct answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "Mambilla Plateau is not located in the Kizi River Basin, therefore,
        it cannot be located north of Lake Kizi." This is not claiming equality but
        rather a geographical relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Mambilla Plateau is not located north of Lake Kizi." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that the lakes are located in different countries (China
        vs Ireland).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided information about the locations
        of Lake Hongze and Lake Muckross, stating that they are in China and Canada
        respectively, and both in the northern parts of their countries. However,
        the model did not explicitly provide a YES or NO answer to any comparative
        question. There is no clear conclusion or judgment stated.

        not NO, this automatically results in False for this question according to
        the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model simply states the locations of both lakes
        (Hongze Lake in China and Muckross Lake in Ireland) but does not provide any
        explicit YES or NO answer to a comparative question. The response doesn't
        contain any clear comparative judgment or conclusion.

      result: UNKNOWN
    8384d59b-82fe-42c3-92ac-f8363bab650a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations of the lakes (one in China, one in Canada), implying a difference
        in position rather than equality. The model does not claim the lakes are at
        the same latitude or equally north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, Hongze Lake
        is not located north of Muckross Lake." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. The model is explicitly stating "NO" to the comparison of whether
        Hongze Lake is north of Muckross Lake.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the passage does not specify the location of Hongze Lake. This is a
        reason based on lack of information, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer. While
        it mentions not having information about Hongze Lake's location, it still
        provides a clear "NO" as its comparative result rather than indicating it
        cannot make the determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, Hongze
        Lake is located north of Muckross Lake." This is a statement of fact without
        an explicit YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model has drawn
        a conclusion about the relative positions but hasn't framed it as a direct
        YES/NO answer to a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was REFUSED),
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "The passage does not provide
        enough information to answer this question." This indicates the model is refusing
        to provide a comparative answer because it lacks sufficient information. This
        falls under the REFUSED category as the model is explicitly declining to make
        the comparison.

        are equal or the same. It simply states that Hongze Lake is in China/Asia
        while Muckross Lake is in Ireland/Europe, and concludes that Hongze Lake is
        not north of Muckross Lake. The model does not claim the lakes are at the
        same latitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of Satpura Range and Batchawana Bay) are equal or the same.
        It simply states that Satpura Range is in India and Batchawana Bay is in Canada,
        then concludes that Satpura Range is not north of Batchawana Bay. It does
        not mention equality of positions as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response only provides factual information
        about the locations of the Satpura Range and Batchawana Bay, stating that
        one is in India and the other is in Canada. It does not provide any explicit
        YES or NO answer to a comparative question. The response is incomplete and
        doesn't contain a clear conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, indicating
        it does not affirm the comparison. However, the reason given is that it lacks
        information to make the comparison ("The passage does not specify whether
        Satpura Range is located north or south of Batchawana Bay"), which means it
        cannot determine the answer rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a YES or NO answer. This indicates the
        model is refusing to make the comparison due to lack of information.

        (the locations of the lakes) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that
        it lacks information to make the comparison ("the passage does not specify").
        The NO is based on insufficient information, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that it lacks information to make the comparison, it still
        provides a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        uncertainty in its final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Lake Mai-Ndombe is in Africa which is south of Asia (where Loktak Lake
        is), implying a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        Lake Mai-Ndombe is not located north of Loktak Lake, without specifying that
        they are at the same latitude. The model gives no indication that the NO answer
        is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, Lake
        Mai-Ndombe is not located north of Loktak Lake." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Lake Mai-Ndombe is in the Democratic
        Republic of the Congo and Loktak Lake is in India, and concludes that Lake
        Mai-Ndombe is not north of Loktak Lake. The model does not claim the lakes
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't provide equality as the reason for its NO
        answer. Instead, it discusses Mayotte being in the Indian Ocean and the Indian
        Ocean's surroundings, but doesn't explicitly compare the locations of Lake
        Mai-Ndombe and Loktak Lake or state they are equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Lake Mai-Ndombe is in the Democratic
        Republic of the Congo while Loktak Lake is in India, implying they are in
        different locations. The NO answer is based on relative positions, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        It simply states that Lake Erie is not located north of the Nuba Mountains
        without indicating that they are at the same latitude. The NO answer is not
        based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO. Lake

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "NO" because the passage doesn't specify
        the relative positions, and then notes that the locations are in different
        continents. This is not a claim of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in response to the
        comparative question. The model gives a clear negative answer based on the
        fact that the passage doesn't specify the relative positions of the locations.

        (the latitudes) are equal or the same. Instead, it implies a difference in
        location by noting that Nuba Mountains are in Africa while Clear Fork Reservoir
        is in North America. The NO answer is based on geographical difference, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Nuba Mountains are

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two locations
        are in different regions (Middle East vs. United States), indicating a clear
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

        are at the same latitude or have equal positions. There is no mention of equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.

        - it claims that Imatong Mountains is in the southern hemisphere while Laguna
        Salada is in the northern hemisphere (though this reasoning contains factual
        errors). Since the NO is not based on equality of values, the answer is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
