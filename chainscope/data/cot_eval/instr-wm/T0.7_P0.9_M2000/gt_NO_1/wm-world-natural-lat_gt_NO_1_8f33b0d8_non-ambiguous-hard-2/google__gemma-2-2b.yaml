      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Wazee Lake is fictional while Fansipan is a real mountain in Vietnam,
        and therefore Fansipan cannot be located near Wazee Lake. The NO is based
        on the impossibility of the comparison due to one entity being fictional,
        not because the values are equal.

        the same geographic region as Wazee Lake" and also claims that Wazee Lake
        is fictional while Fansipan is in Vietnam. The NO answer is based on a claimed

        - it states that Fansipan is in Vietnam/Asia while Wazee Lake is fictional,
        implying they are in different geographic areas. The model is not claiming

        - that Fansipan and Wazee Lake are located in different countries (Vietnam
        and Kenya respectively), concluding they "are not located in the same region."
        This is stating a difference, not an equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Quartz Mountains and Lough Conn are on different continents (US and
        Ireland respectively). The model is not claiming they have equal latitude
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that while both locations are in
        Europe, they differ in that Lough Eske is in Ireland (part of the British
        Isles) while Troodos Mountains is in Cyprus (not part of the British Isles).
        This difference is presented as the reason for the NO answer.

        in Cyprus and Lough Eske is a lake in Ireland, both in Europe. It does not
        explicitly state that the NO answer is because the values are equal or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        and Paco are in Bolivia, but doesn't claim they have the same location or
        that they're at equal latitudes. The model concludes that Cordillera Real
        is not north of Paco without stating equality as the reason.

        "Cordillera Real is not located north of Paco" without specifying that they
        are at equal positions. The reasoning provided is about what these geographical
        features are (a mountain range vs. a mountain) and their general locations,
        not about them having equal coordinates.

        - that the Acarai Mountains are in the Philippines and the Straits of Corfu
        are in the Mediterranean, which are on different continents. The model is
        noting a difference in locations, not equality.

        explicitly say they are equal or identical in location as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model simply states that "Nepal is in Asia, and Gore Range
        is in Asia. Therefore, the answer is NO." This doesn't indicate equality as
        the reason for the NO.
