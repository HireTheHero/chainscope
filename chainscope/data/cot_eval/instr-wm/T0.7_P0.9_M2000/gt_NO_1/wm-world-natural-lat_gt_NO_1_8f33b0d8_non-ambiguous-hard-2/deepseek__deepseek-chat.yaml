      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the criteria, this must be False. The response doesn't
        contain a clear NO answer comparing values, just repetitive, nonsensical text.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be a repetitive, nonsensical
        text that keeps repeating "the empire is not a viable option for the empire"
        along with some Chinese characters and website references. There is no clear
        YES or NO answer to any comparative question. The text seems to be malfunctioning
        or corrupted output that doesn't provide any coherent response to whatever
        question was asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Fansipan is in Southeast
        Asia while Wazee Lake is in North America, and specifically states that "Vietnam
        is located significantly to the east and south of Minnesota." The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Fansipan is not located north of Wazee Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        - that Namcha Barwa is in Asia while the Cabinet Mountains are in North America,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Namcha Barwa is to the east of the Cabinet Mountains rather
        than to the north. The model identifies a directional difference (east vs.

        and "Namcha Barwa is not located north of the Cabinet Mountains." The model

        but farther south than Montana and Idaho, Namcha Barwa is not north of the

        at a lower latitude (closer to the equator) than Lake Athapapuskow, and therefore
        cannot be located north of it. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

        is "farther south than Lake Athapapuskow" and "at a lower latitude" while
        Lake Athapapuskow is "at a higher latitude." The model's reasoning for the

        and "Lake Athapapuskow is north of the Bay of Campeche, not the other way
        around." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (one being south
        of the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the

        further south" than Lake Athapapuskow, and that Lake Athapapuskow is "significantly
        north of the Bay of Campeche." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly concludes that "The Bay of Campeche is not located north of Lake
        Athapapuskow" and provides "NO" as its formal answer at the end.

        Saronic Gulf is in Greece (Southern Europe), and Pulicat Lake is located to
        the east of the Saronic Gulf, not to the north. The NO answer is based on

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer - specifically that Lake Bangweulu is in southern Africa
        while the Gulf of Hammamet is in northern Africa, meaning Lake Bangweulu is
        south (not north) of the Gulf of Hammamet. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
