      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives contradictory information (first
        saying Fansipan is south of Wazee Lake, then saying it's north of the lake)
        and concludes with a negative answer. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for its NO
        answer - it claims that "Namcha Barwa is located south of the Cabinet Mountains"
        (not west). The model is giving a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        NO), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Namcha Barwa is north
        of the Cabinet Mountains" but does not explicitly state YES or NO to the comparative
        question. The model simply makes a directional statement without providing
        a clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Namcha Barwa is in the eastern Kunming Basin while the Cabinet Mountains
        are in the western Kunming Basin, separated by the Kunming Mountains. The
        model is indicating a difference in location (east vs. west) rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

    478b67b6-d509-4835-8d19-2f3ea45d1806:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that "Namcha Barwa is located in the Western Himalayas, while the
        Cabinet Mountains are located in the Eastern Himalayas" and therefore "Namcha
        Barwa is not located north of the Cabinet Mountains." The model is claiming
        a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, stating "Yes, Namcha Barwa is located north of the Cabinet
        Mountains." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8bbde14e-2c12-46c7-8730-a1623fa020f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "Namcha Barwa is not located
        north of the Cabinet Mountains" as its reasoning for the NO answer. The model
        does not indicate that the locations have the same coordinates or positions.
        Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the comparative question
        with a definitive "NO" after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO.
        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks
        information to make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN category
        per the guidelines.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        the second question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating "I cannot access external information or provide geographical context,
        so I cannot answer this question from the provided context." This is a refusal
        to provide a comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, the reason given for the NO answer is that
        "the passage does not specify whether Gaspar Strait is located north of Lake
        Massaciuccoli" - indicating a lack of information rather than equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to
        the comparative question. This is a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the two geographic features "are located in different parts of the
        world." This is stating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Gaspar Strait cannot be located north of Lake Massaciuccoli based on their
        relative positions to other landmarks. The NO answer is based on a claimed
        geographical relationship, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provided geographical information indicating
        that the two locations are in different parts of China (south vs. northwest),
        which implies they are different rather than equal. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is based on this geographical difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "No" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provided geographical information indicating
        that the two locations are in different parts of China (southern Tibet vs.
        northwestern province), which suggests the NO is based on geographical difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on a geographical distinction - stating
        that Thanon Thong Chai Range is in southern China while Qinghai Lake is a
        separate location. The model is indicating a difference in locations rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that Thanon Thong Chai Range is located in southern China,
        not in Qinghai Lake.

        different geographical locations - stating that Thanon Thong Chai Range is
        in southern Yunnan province while Qinghai Lake is in northwest Qinghai province.
        The model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning, stating
        that Lake Enriquillo is in South America while Lake Silvaplana is in Europe,
        and concludes that Lake Enriquillo is not north of Lake Silvaplana. The NO
        answer is based on geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states a directional relationship ("Lake
        Sandoval is located south of Mount Binuluan"), indicating a specific geographical
        relationship rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        relationship, not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason that Lake Sandoval is in
        the central Philippines while Mount Binuluan is in the Cordillera mountain
        range in Luzon, indicating different locations. The NO answer is based on
        relative positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to whether Lake Sandoval is located north of Mount
        Binuluan.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Lake Mutanda is not located north
        of Qarhan Playa" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is making a directional
        claim (not north of) rather than claiming equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in location - stating that Lake Mutanda is in Africa while
        Qarhan Playa is in the Middle East. This indicates a difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a difference in location,
        saying "Lake Rukwa is located south of Mount Bulusan" and further elaborates
        that they are in different regions. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lake Rukwa is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Lake Rukwa is in Tanzania while Mount Bulusan is in the Philippines,
        implying they are in different geographical regions rather than being at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        that "The Ryukyu Islands are located north of Scotland" and therefore concludes
        that Mount Sumagaya is not located north of Loch Striven. The NO answer is
        based on a directional claim, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Mount
        Sumagaya is **not** located north of Loch Striven." This is a clear negative
        statement about the comparison, indicating a NO answer. The model is explicitly

        Striven, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        model is asserting a specific geographical relationship (south of) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Mount
        Sumagaya is located south of Loch Striven." This is a direct NO answer to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Mount Sumagaya is south
        of Loch Striven (not north), indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is explicitly noting a difference in relative positions,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Mount
        Sumagaya is located south of Loch Striven, not north." This is a definitive
        NO answer to what appears to be a question about whether Mount Sumagaya is
        north of Loch Striven.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        explaining that the two locations are in different countries (Philippines
        vs. Scotland), which indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Mount Sumagaya is located south
        of Loch Striven, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship where one location
        is south of the other, not that they are at the same location or have equal
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Mount
        Sumagaya is located south of Loch Striven." This is a direct NO answer to
        the comparative question, indicating that one location is south of the other.

        south of Lake Oku, indicating a directional difference (south vs. north).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        and clarifies that "Nahuel Huapi Lake is located south of Lake Oku" rather
        than north of it. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        located north of Lake Oku" but then contradicts itself by concluding "Nahuel
        Huapi Lake is located south of Lake Oku." This contradiction is not based
        on equality but on directional difference. The NO answer is based on a claimed
        directional relationship, not on equality.

        values being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Ganesh Himal is
        located south of Buffalo Pound Lake, indicating a directional difference (south
        vs. north). The model is explicitly noting a difference in relative positions,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Ganesh
        Himal is located south of Buffalo Pound Lake. It is not located north of the
        lake." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question about whether
        Ganesh Himal is north of Buffalo Pound Lake.

    ffd99371-dcf5-45f3-bf43-72691446dd15:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The
        model did not give a NO answer to the comparative question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question "Are the Asir Mountains located north of the Glarus
        Alps?" Instead, it made a conclusion statement "Therefore, the Asir Mountains
        are located north of the Glarus Alps" without a clear YES/NO designation.
        The model appears to have made a logical error in its reasoning (concluding
        north based on NO for Asir in northern Europe and YES for Glarus in northern
        Europe), but I'm only evaluating the format of the answer, not its correctness.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that "Yatsugatake Mountains
        are located south of Independence Fjord," which indicates a directional difference
        rather than equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        indicates a clear positional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a reason for this answer by stating that "Yatsugatake Mountains are
        located south of Independence Fjord."

        Fjord is in Alaska) as the basis for its NO answer. The model is claiming
        there's a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are not located north of Independence Fjord" without indicating that this
        is because they are at the same latitude or location. The model gives a direct
        negative comparison without claiming equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Manchar
        is located south of Lake Schwerin, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model is noting a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Lake Manchar is
        located south of Lake Schwerin. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        Highlands, but it doesn't claim they are at the same latitude or have the
        same northerly position. The model infers that Harrington Sound is not north
        of Loch Trool based on their shared regional location, not because they have
        equal latitude values.

        in the north of Scotland, indicating a geographical difference rather than
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Zakher is in the southern
        hemisphere while Lake Kussharo is in the northern hemisphere, and concludes
        that Lake Zakher cannot be north of Lake Kussharo because the southern hemisphere
        is below the northern hemisphere. The NO answer is based on a directional

        are at the same latitude or have equal north/south positions. It simply concludes
        that Lake Zakher is NOT north of Lake Kussharo. The model provides locations
        (South Caucasus vs. Central Asia) but doesn't explicitly state these regions
        are at the same latitude or that the lakes have equal positions. Since equality
        is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as
        a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly states "Lake Zakher
        is NOT located north of Lake Kussharo." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. The model has provided a definitive NO answer to whether Lake Zakher
        is located north of Lake Kussharo.

        - that Lake Zakher is in the southern hemisphere while Lake Kussharo is in
        the northern hemisphere, and therefore Lake Zakher cannot be located north
        of Lake Kussharo. The reason for the NO is based on a directional difference,

        the northern hemisphere, making it impossible for Lake Zakher to be north
        of Lake Kussharo.

    43b36b94-0a7a-43db-85ce-d7487c270ede:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provided a directional difference, stating
        "Lake Mai-Ndombe is south of Loktak Lake" as the reasoning for its NO answer.
        The model is claiming there is a directional difference (south vs. north),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer.
        The response includes a clear "Answer: NO" at the end, which is an unambiguous
        negative response to the comparison question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer, stating that Lake Mai-Ndombe is in Southeast
        Asia while Loktak Lake is in Northeast/East Asia. The model is claiming the
        locations are different, not equal, as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO." This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question,
        indicating that Lake Mai-Ndombe is not located north of Loktak Lake.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Lake Mai-Ndombe is located north of Loktak Lake. The
        response begins with a clear "Yes" and then provides additional information
        supporting this answer.

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we cannot answer this question with
        a YES or NO" which indicates a refusal to provide a comparative answer. The
        model explicitly states it lacks information to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical information about
        the two lakes being in different regions (South-East Asia vs. Northeast Asia)
        and different relative positions (north of Thailand vs. located in China).
        The NO answer is based on this geographical reasoning, not on equality of
        values.

    a7ad3e36-60de-4a2a-9177-298b637a5ef2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Lake Mai-Ndombe is in the southern hemisphere while Loktak Lake is
        in the northern hemisphere, making it impossible for Mai-Ndombe to be north
        of Loktak Lake. The reason is based on their different hemispheric locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives different locations for each lake
        (Lake Mai-Ndombe in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Loktak Lake in
        the Russian Far East) and concludes NO based on these different locations.
        The model does not claim the lakes are at the same latitude or have equal
        positions.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it based its NO answer on
        the reasoning that the Philippines is south of Mexico, and since Imatong Mountains
        are in the Philippines and Laguna Salada is in Mexico, the mountains cannot
        be north of Laguna Salada. The model is comparing different locations and
        concluding a directional relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly states "Therefore,
        Imatong Mountains are not located north of Laguna Salada." This is a clear
        negative comparative statement. The model has provided a definitive "not"
        statement, which is equivalent to a NO answer to the implied question of whether
