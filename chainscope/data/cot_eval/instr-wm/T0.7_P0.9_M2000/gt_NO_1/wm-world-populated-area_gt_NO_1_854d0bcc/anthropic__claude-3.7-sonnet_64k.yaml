        Instead, it explicitly states that Yuexiu District (33.8 square kilometers)
        has a larger area than Coralville (25.4 square kilometers). The model says
        "Since 25.4 is less than 33.8, Coralville has a smaller area than Yuexiu District."

        after comparing the areas of Coralville, Iowa and Yuexiu District. The model
        concludes that Coralville does not have a larger area than Yuexiu District.

        Pasu District has a smaller area (945 sq km) than Uonuma (953 sq km), not
        because the values are the same. The model explicitly states "Since 945 sq
        km is less than 953 sq km, Kubang Pasu District does not have a larger area
        than Uonuma." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Mount Pleasant has a larger area (approximately

        Jon has a smaller area than Mount Pleasant." The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the areas of San Jon, New Mexico and Mount Pleasant,
        Utah. The model concludes that San Jon does not have a larger area than Mount
        Pleasant because San Jon's area (1.9 square miles) is less than Mount Pleasant's

        Instead, it explicitly states that San Jon's area (2.3 sq mi) is smaller than

        found that one value is smaller than the other, not because they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in size, stating "Beer, Devon has
        a larger area than Eldorado Springs, Colorado" and providing the specific
        measurements (1.9 square miles vs 2.0 square miles). The NO answer is based
        on Beer being larger, not on the areas being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Eldorado Springs, Colorado does not have a larger
        area than Beer, Devon. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Beer, Devon (2.0 square miles) is larger
        than Eldorado Springs, Colorado (0.45 square miles), noting that Beer is "approximately
        4 times the area of Eldorado Springs." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the areas of Eldorado Springs, Colorado and Beer, Devon. The
        model provides specific measurements and concludes that Beer, Devon is larger.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Beer, Devon has a larger area than Eldorado
        Springs, Colorado. In fact, it notes "Beer, Devon has approximately twice
        the area of Eldorado Springs, Colorado." This indicates a clear difference
        in values, not equality.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Eldorado Springs (0.94 square miles) has
        a smaller area than Beer, Devon (2.2 square miles). The model gives a NO answer
        because it found that one area is smaller than the other, not because they

        Instead, it explicitly states that Longtan District (75.54 sq km) is smaller
        than Birgunj (133.8 sq km), and this inequality is the reason for the NO answer.
        The model shows "75.54 sq km (Longtan) < 133.8 sq km (Birgunj)" and concludes
        that Longtan does not have a larger area because it has a smaller area.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly concludes "Since Longtan District's area is smaller than

        Instead, it explicitly states that Royal Palm Beach (11.5 square miles/29.8
        square kilometers) is larger than Uravakonda (2.7 square miles/6.9 square
        kilometers). The model even specifies that Royal Palm Beach is "approximately
        4 times larger" than Uravakonda. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Uravakonda does not
        have a larger area than Royal Palm Beach, Florida" as its final answer. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        (28.5 square kilometers/11 square miles) is significantly larger than Uravakonda
        (7.8 square kilometers/3 square miles). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in size, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Uravakonda has an area of approximately
        6.2 square kilometers while Royal Palm Beach has an area of approximately
        29.0 square kilometers, and concludes that Uravakonda has a smaller area than
        Royal Palm Beach. The model gives a NO answer because it found Uravakonda
        to be smaller, not because the areas are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the areas of Uravakonda and Royal Palm Beach, Florida. The
        model concludes that Uravakonda has a smaller area than Royal Palm Beach,
        Florida.
