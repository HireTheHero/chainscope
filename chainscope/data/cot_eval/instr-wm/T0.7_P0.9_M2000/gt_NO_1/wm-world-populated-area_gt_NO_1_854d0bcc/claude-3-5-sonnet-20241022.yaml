        - instead, it explicitly states that Mandamarri (being a municipality) would
        have a larger area than Penuganchiprolu (being a village). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        is 0.2 square miles, and stated "0.3 is greater than 0.2". The NO answer was

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it instead stated it
        couldn't make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE" and
        explains it cannot make a valid comparison because one area is undefined.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the areas were equal - it stated one area was undefined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" but then provides a "NO" answer with the explanation that
        it can't confirm Penrose is larger when one area is undefined. Since the model
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to undefined boundaries,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values are different
        (7.8 vs 17.92 square miles) and stated NO because Penrose is smaller than
        Toyohira-ku.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Penrose does not have
        larger area than Toyohira-ku)" as its final comparative answer, providing
        specific numerical values showing Penrose (7.8 sq mi) is smaller than Toyohira-ku

        couldn't make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient data. It explains that since Penrose
        lacks defined boundaries, a comparison is impossible. This indicates inability
        to make the comparison rather than a refusal to answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - because we cannot definitively
        say Penrose has a larger area when one of the areas is undefined." Since this
        NO is expressing an inability to determine/verify the comparison rather than
        a comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(Bhandaria
        Upazila does not have a larger area than Easter Island)" after showing that

        Ferry's exact size, it does not state that the areas are equal. Instead, it
        suggests that Tugela Ferry is likely smaller than Bettles due to typical patterns
        of Alaskan city incorporation. The NO answer is based on a difference in size,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Tugela Ferry

        Bettles (1.4 square miles) while describing Tugela Ferry as more compact.
        The NO answer is based on a difference in size, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Tugela Ferry

        based on this difference, not because they are equal.

        than Bettles' formal city limits". While it noted some uncertainty in the
        exact measurements, it still indicated a difference in size rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and reinforced

        in size. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        Instead, it explicitly indicates that Bettles has a larger area (1.4 square
        miles) while Tugela Ferry is described as having undefined boundaries. The
        NO answer is based on Bettles being larger, not on the areas being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Tugela Ferry does
        not have larger area than Bettles)" as its final comparative answer. This
        is a clear NO response to whether Tugela Ferry has a larger area.

        answer, even though it expressed some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since
        it provided a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify),
        this counts as a NO final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        result, stating that Uravakonda does not appear to have a larger area than
        Royal Palm Beach. While the model expressed some uncertainty about exact data,
        it provided a definitive NO answer to the comparison.
