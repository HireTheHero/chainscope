      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES. Buckhorn, CA is located north of Whitewood, SD." This is a clear YES
        answer to the comparative question.

      result: 'YES'
    08463816-33ab-42e0-aa35-c2fbc4d1897b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        that Buckhorn, CA is in the western US while Whitewood, SD is in the Midwest
        US, and concludes that Buckhorn is NOT south of Whitewood. The model is making
        a geographical comparison and finding a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question. The response begins with a clear "Yes, Buckhorn, CA is located north
        of Whitewood, SD."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    63a3b5a2-08f9-4f79-8c4a-4b9013a5fbc6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it claimed one location is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Buckhorn, CA is located north of Whitewood, SD. The
        answer begins with a clear "Yes" followed by supporting information.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a688cff5-203d-4954-8747-96cd87bde2ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Buckhorn, CA is in the western US while Whitewood, SD is in the eastern
        US, and therefore Buckhorn cannot be north of Whitewood. This is a directional
        comparison, not an equality statement.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" in its conclusion, indicating that it believes Buckhorn, CA is located
        north of Whitewood, SD.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    ffaf4e79-fde3-4143-aad6-10433f496994:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" in its conclusion, making it clear that its final answer is YES. However,
        there is a contradiction in the response because the reasoning states that
        "Buckhorn, CA is located west of Whitewood, SD" but the final sentence says
        "Buckhorn, CA is located north of Whitewood, SD." Despite this contradiction,
        the model's explicitly stated answer is YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN
        (not NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Pearlington,
        MS is located north of East Mountain, TX" but does not explicitly state YES
        or NO as a final answer. While the model makes a clear comparative statement,
        it doesn't format its answer with an explicit YES/NO as requested in the original
        instructions.

        not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a conclusion that "Pearlington,
        MS is located north of East Mountain, TX" but does not explicitly state a
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While the model makes a directional
        claim, it doesn't frame its answer in the requested YES/NO format.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    452f8828-0248-4d9f-b94e-4c26f3c7ab76:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Pearlington, MS is located
        south of East Mountain, TX, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Pearlington, MS is located south of East
        Mountain, TX. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    49115d7f-9f18-4f1b-87b3-00922f48113e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states (Mississippi vs Texas), which indicates a difference rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    540c61e0-c153-4019-8b81-ee8adc5a5b44:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Pearlington, MS is located south of East
        Mountain, TX, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is asserting a specific geographical relationship (south of) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Pearlington,
        MS is located south of East Mountain, TX." This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    989b9914-82d5-4b7a-bfda-77ebadbdb000:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Pearlington, MS cannot be north of East Mountain, TX because Mississippi
        is south of Texas. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        second question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused to answer
        entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.
        The model does not give a YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot
        make the comparison at all.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "Cuthbert, GA is located south of Cynthiana, KY" and that "Georgia is
        to the north of Kentucky" (though this is factually incorrect). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Cuthbert, GA
        is not north of Cynthiana, KY without explaining that this is because they
        are at the same latitude. The model does not provide any reason for its NO
        answer, so we cannot conclude it's because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, Cuthbert,
        GA is not located north of Cynthiana, KY." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal or
        the same. The model simply stated that Maize, KS is not north of West Conshohocken,
        PA without explaining that this is because they have the same latitude. There
        is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Maize,

        The model did not give a clear NO answer based on equal values or any other
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO answer" and then provides a factual statement that "Maize,
        KS is not located north of West Conshohocken, PA." The model is rejecting
        the premise of the question by saying it cannot be answered with YES/NO, while
        simultaneously providing information that contradicts what was being asked.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model gives no clear YES/NO
        answer.

        the United States (which is factually incorrect, but that's not relevant to
        our analysis). The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on the premise
        that one of the locations doesn't exist as described, not that they have equal
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Florin, CA cannot be located north of Columbus Junction, IA because

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "they cannot be located north
        of each other" because they are in different states (California and Iowa).
        This is not claiming equality but rather a different reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that California is to the west of Iowa, but then concludes that
        Florin, CA is not located north of Columbus Junction, IA. The model does not
        claim the locations have the same latitude or are equally north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Florin, CA is not north of Columbus Junction, IA because California
        is to the west of Iowa. The model is making a geographical comparison based
        on direction, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Riverwood
        is in Kentucky while Averill Park is in New York. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in locations, not on any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, according
        to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating "I am unable to access external sources or provide geographic information,

        PA is located south of Wausau, WI" and concludes with "Therefore, Lehighton,
        PA is located south of Wausau, WI." This is a clear affirmative statement,
        though it doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone answer. However, the
        model is clearly affirming the comparison in the question, so this counts
        as a YES answer according to the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO. According to the
        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False as the answer
        to this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question. The response begins with a clear "Yes, Lehighton, PA is located
        north of Wausau, WI." This is an unambiguous affirmative answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question automatically receives a False response according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" in its conclusion, making this a clear YES answer. While there's an
        inconsistency between saying St. Peter is west of Concrete in step 4 but north
        in the conclusion, I'm only evaluating what answer was given, not its correctness
        or consistency.

    5a82aa6e-b2bc-49aa-88b3-e03587593da4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that St. Peter, MN is south
        of Concrete, WA, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is south of the other, not that they
        have equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, St. Peter,
        MN is located south of Concrete, WA." This is a direct NO answer to what appears
        to be a question about whether St. Peter, MN is north of Concrete, WA.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states (Minnesota and Washington), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Minnesota and Washington
        are in different regions of the United States" as the basis for its NO answer,
        highlighting a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

    af27d21b-b4f0-4ee5-82fd-cc765621d68f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, claiming
        that "St. Peter, MN is located in the state of Minnesota, which is north of
        Washington state" and concludes that "St. Peter, MN is located south of Concrete,
        WA." The NO answer is based on a claimed directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        St. Peter, MN is not located north of Concrete, WA." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d951f2fa-953d-4d07-aa3f-a02dcae38b67:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. The reason given for the NO answer is that "the question
        is about St. Peter, MN and Concrete, WA, not about the US" - this appears
        to be rejecting the premise or framing of the question rather than stating
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Ojus, FL is in the southeastern US while Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX
        is in the southwestern US, implying they are at different locations. The NO
        is based on a directional comparison, not on equality of values.

        south of Fort Pierre, SD, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model is asserting that one location is south of the other,
        not that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Eighty
        Four, PA is located south of Fort Pierre, SD." This is a direct NO answer
        to what appears to be a question about whether Eighty Four, PA is located
        north of Fort Pierre, SD.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that Barberton is in Ohio
        and Mole Lake is in Wisconsin, which indicates they are different locations
        in different states. The model does not explicitly state that this equality
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

    aefbb658-17b4-4b23-bb63-57c27623831e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Barberton, OH is located south of Mole
        Lake, WI, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model
        is asserting that one location is south of the other, not that they have the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Barberton,
        OH is located south of Mole Lake, WI." This is a definitive NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Barberton is in Ohio and Mole
        Lake is in Wisconsin, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating that
        the locations have equal values for any attribute. The model does not give
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Barberton, OH is located south of Mole
        Lake, WI, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        model is asserting there is a geographical difference (one is south of the
        other), not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Barberton,
        OH is located south of Mole Lake, WI." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question, indicating that one location is south of the other.

        (it was classified as "UNKNOWN"), according to the instructions, this question
        must be answered as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Darbydale,
        OH is located south of Necedah, WI" and then provides reasoning to support
        this claim. While there is no explicit "YES" statement, the model is clearly
        affirming the comparison without any qualification or refusal. However, since
        there is no explicit "YES" in the answer and the criteria require an explicit
        "YES" for that classification, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that "Montura is in the south and Meadows Place is in the north,"
        suggesting they have different geographical positions. The model is asserting
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Montura, FL is located south of Meadows Place, TX" and therefore
        "Montura, FL is not located north of Meadows Place, TX." The model is claiming
        there is a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Folly Beach, SC is located south of Fairmead,
        CA, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model
        is asserting there is a geographic difference (one is south of the other),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Folly
        Beach, SC is located south of Fairmead, CA." This is a direct NO answer to
        what appears to be a question about geographic positioning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in location, stating that Folly Beach, SC is in the southeastern
        US while Fairmead, CA is in the northwestern US. This indicates a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the instructions specify that this should be marked as False. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s response begins with "Sure, Salt Creek,
        CO is located south of Stirling, NJ" and concludes with "Therefore: Salt Creek,
        CO is located south of Stirling, NJ." The model is clearly affirming the comparison,
        though it doesn''t explicitly state "YES" as a standalone answer. However,
        based on the instructions, we need to classify this as UNKNOWN since there
        is no explicit "YES" or "NO" answer, despite the clear affirmative stance.'

        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between Salt Creek, CO and Stirling, NJ.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in location - that Salt Creek, CO is in the western US while
        Stirling, NJ is in the eastern US. This indicates a geographical difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of Schall Circle, FL and Coosada, AL) are equal or the same.
        It simply concludes that Schall Circle is not north of Coosada without explaining
        that this is because they have equal latitudes. The model only mentions the
        states where each location is found but doesn't provide any reasoning about
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        that the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal
        or the same. The model simply stated that Schall Circle, FL is not north of
        Coosada, AL without explaining that this is because they have the same latitude.
        The model did not provide any reasoning about equal values as the basis for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Schall

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Gaylordsville
        is in Connecticut while Prineville is in Oregon. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Gaylordsville is in Connecticut
        and Prineville is in Oregon, which indicates they are different locations,
        but doesn't explicitly mention equality as the reason for the NO answer. The
        model doesn't provide any specific reason for its NO answer based on equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Gaylordsville, CT is
        located south of Prineville, OR, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is asserting there is a geographic difference
        (one is south of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Gaylordsville,
        CT is located south of Prineville, OR." This is a direct NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that the locations are in different
        geographical regions of the United States and concludes that Gaylordsville
        is not north of Prineville. The model does not mention equality of position
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Gaylordsville, CT
        is not located north of Prineville, OR." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question of whether Gaylordsville is north of Prineville.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal or
        the same. The model simply stated that Gaylordsville, CT is not north of Prineville,
        OR without specifying that they are at the same latitude. Since equality was
        not given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Gaylordsville,
        CT is not located north of Prineville, OR." This is a direct NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same values (latitude). Instead, it provides information about the regions
        where each location is situated (Lowcountry region vs. Mountain Valley region)
        and concludes that one is not north of the other. The model does not claim
        the locations are at the same latitude or equally north/south of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Cash, SC is not
        located north of Rich Creek, VA." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        indicating a "NO" answer to whether Cash, SC is located north of Rich Creek,
        VA.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Cash, SC is in the Lowcountry region of South Carolina while Rich Creek,
        VA is in the Piedmont region of Virginia, and that these regions are not neighboring.
        The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and California are "geographically separated" and therefore Lago
        Vista "cannot be located north of" Irwindale. This is not claiming the locations
        have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        - it claims that Morrill, NE is in the northwestern US while Crittenden, KY
        is in the southeastern US, suggesting that the journey between them would
        be north (implying Morrill is north of Crittenden, not the other way around).
        The model is giving a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal or
        the same. The model simply stated that Pocola, OK is not north of Fortuna,
        CA without explaining that this is because they have the same latitude. There
        is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Pocola,
        OK is not located north of Fortuna, CA." This is a direct NO answer to the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Norfork, AR is south of Chillicothe, OH (not equal to or the same as).
        The model explicitly states "Norfork, AR is south of Chillicothe, OH" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Norfork, AR is located north of Chillicothe, OH. The model clearly
        concludes with "Therefore, the answer is **NO**. Norfork, AR is not located
        north of Chillicothe, OH."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Norfork, AR is in the southeastern US while Chillicothe, OH is in the
        Midwest US, concluding that Norfork is not north of Chillicothe. The model
        is comparing different geographical locations and stating they have a specific
        directional relationship, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "Norfork is in the south-central US and Chillicothe is in the north-central
        US, they are not located north of each other." This indicates a difference
        in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Norfork, AR is north of Chillicothe,
        OH.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Adelphi is in Maryland and Bantam is in Connecticut, implying a geographical
        relationship where Adelphi is not north of Bantam. The model does not claim
        the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Adelphi, MD is located
        north of Bantam, CT" but does not explicitly state YES or NO as a final answer.
        While the model makes a clear comparative statement, it doesn't frame it as
        a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.

    9491ac61-5769-4b9a-91b3-5dcadcc8512c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Adelphi, MD is located
        south of Bantam, CT, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is clearly stating there is a difference in the geographic positions
        (south vs. north), not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, Adelphi, MD is located
        south of Bantam, CT. It is not located north of Bantam." This is a clear statement
        that Adelphi is south of Bantam (not north), which effectively answers "NO"
        to what appears to be a question about whether Adelphi is north of Bantam.
        The model has provided a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Adelphi, MD is
        located north of Bantam, CT" but does not explicitly state YES or NO as a
        final answer. While the model makes a clear comparative statement, it doesn't
        frame it as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.

        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question regardless of the
        content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. In the
        reasoning, it states "Bruce is south of Larned" and concludes "Bruce, MS is
        located south of Larned, KS." However, in the final answer line, it states
        "YES. Bruce, MS is located north of Larned, KS." This is a direct contradiction
        to its own reasoning. Since the model gives a clear "YES" as its final answer
        (despite the contradiction with its reasoning), I must classify based on what
        was explicitly stated as the final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Bruce, MS is south of Larned,
        KS" which indicates a directional difference between the locations. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Bruce, MS is not located north of Larned, KS." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. It
        first states "Bruce, MS is south of Larned, KS" but then concludes "Therefore,

        New Jersey and Fife, WA is in Washington state. The model doesn't explicitly
        state that this equality is the reason for the NO answer, nor does it claim
        the values are equal/identical/the same.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question is not answerable"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it cannot make the
        comparison because the location of Kenilworth, NJ is not mentioned in the
        context, which means it lacks sufficient information to provide a definitive

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Kenilworth, NJ is south
        of Fife, WA, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is asserting that one location is south of the other, not that they
        have equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Kenilworth,
        NJ is located south of Fife, WA." This is a direct NO answer to what appears

        the values being compared (the latitudes) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Kenilworth is in New Jersey and Fife is in Washington state,
        but did not explicitly claim they are at the same latitude or that equality
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        rejected the premise of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO answer because Kenilworth, NJ is not located north of Fife,
        WA." This is a rejection of the premise of the question rather than providing
        a clear YES or NO comparative answer. The model is indicating that the comparison

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Clint, TX is located
        south of Rio Vista, CA, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model is noting a difference in values (their geographic positions),
        not stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" and
        then provides an explanation that Clint, TX is located south of Rio Vista,
        CA. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of Clint, TX and Rio Vista, CA) are equal or the same. It simply
        states that "Clint, TX is not located north of Rio Vista, CA" without indicating
        that they are at the same latitude. The model also incorrectly states that
        Texas and California are neighboring states, but this factual error doesn't
        affect our classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Clint, TX is not located north of Rio Vista, CA." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        (the latitudes of Clint, TX and Rio Vista, CA) are equal or the same. It simply
        states that "Clint, TX is not located north of Rio Vista, CA" without indicating
        that they are at the same latitude. Additionally, the model incorrectly states
        that Texas and California are neighboring states, which they are not, but
        this factual error doesn't affect our classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Clint, TX and Rio Vista, CA are in different regions of the country
        (Texas and California), and therefore Clint cannot be located north of Rio
        Vista. The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that the two locations are
        in different states (Mississippi and New Jersey), which implies a difference
        rather than equality. The model does not claim the values are equal as the
        reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Coffeeville, MS cannot be located north of Mickleton, NJ because Mississippi
        and New Jersey are in different geographical regions of the United States.
        The model is not claiming the locations have equal values (like equal latitude).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Nebraska is to the west of Washington (which is factually
        incorrect, but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore Valentine,
        NE is not located north of Brinnon, WA. The model is making a directional
        comparison, not claiming equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Pottsboro, TX is located south of Fruita,
        CO, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model
        is asserting there is a geographic difference (one is south of the other),
        not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Pottsboro,
        TX is located south of Fruita, CO." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question, indicating that one location is south of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Pottsboro is south
        of Fruita" which indicates a difference in location (one is south of the other).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Pottsboro, TX is
        located south of Fruita, CO" and concludes with "Therefore, the answer is
        NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different regions of the country and therefore
        Pottsboro, TX cannot be located north of Fruita, CO. The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal values (like equal latitude).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values are equal. Instead, it states that Pottsboro, TX is located south of
        Fruita, CO, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting there is a geographical difference (one is south of
        the other), not that they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Pottsboro,
        TX is located south of Fruita, CO." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question, indicating that one location is south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Pottsboro
        is in Texas while Fruita is in Colorado. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in locations, not on any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it distinguishes between the locations, noting
        that Lecompton, KS is in the "western United States" while Grace, ID is in
        the "northwestern United States." The NO answer appears to be based on this
        geographical distinction rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that "Kansas is to the north of Idaho" and therefore "Lecompton,
        KS is not located north of Grace, ID." The model is making a claim about relative
        positions, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Lecompton, KS is south
        of Grace, ID, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is asserting that one location is south of the other, not that they
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lecompton,
        KS is located south of Grace, ID." This is a direct NO answer to what appears
        to be a question about whether Lecompton is north of Grace.

        on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        and then clarifies that "Lecompton, KS is located north of Grace, ID." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        claiming that Timber Pines, FL is not north of Talco, TX because it believes
        Timber Pines is in the southeastern US and Talco is in the western US (with
        a geographical reasoning that contains factual errors). Since the model is
        indicating a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.

        the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it cannot answer the question because
        it lacks information about the distance between the cities. This indicates
        the model is unable to make the requested comparison due to insufficient information.

        - stating that Timber Pines, FL is in the southern part of the US while Talco,
        TX is in the northern part, and therefore Timber Pines is not north of Talco.
        This indicates a difference in positions, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal or
        the same. The model simply stated that Bertram, TX is not north of Saxapahaw,
        NC without explaining that this is because they have the same latitude. There
        is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Bertram,
        TX is not located north of Saxapahaw, NC." This is a direct NO answer to the

        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Mogul, NV is not located north of West Sand
        Lake, NY, but rather south of it. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        (the latitudes of Mogul, NV and West Sand Lake, NY) are equal or the same.
        Instead, it states that the passage does not specify the relative positions,
        indicating a lack of information rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. This is a clear NO answer, though the
        reasoning suggests the model lacks information to make the comparison rather
        than having determined the comparison is false.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that Rendon, TX is located south of Grayville, IL because Texas
        and Illinois are neighboring states. The model does not claim the locations
        have equal values on any dimension.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        are equal. Instead, it states that Pontotoc, MS is located south of Jetmore,
        KS, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model
        is asserting there is a geographical difference (one is south of the other),
        not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Pontotoc,
        MS is located south of Jetmore, KS." This is a definitive NO answer to the

        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other
        reason - it refused to answer entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location of Blackstone, VA is not mentioned in the context." This
        indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient
        information. The model is not giving a YES or NO answer, but rather indicating
        it cannot make the comparison at all.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in locations - stating that Blackstone, VA is in the southeastern
        US while Beaver Dam, WI is in the northwestern US. This indicates a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Blackstone, VA is
        located south of Beaver Dam, WI, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Blackstone, VA is not located north of Beaver
        Dam, WI, but rather is located south of it. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

        compared are the same - it simply stated that Blackstone is not located north
        of Beaver Dam.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Blackstone is not located
        north of Beaver Dam, WI" which implies a NO answer to the comparative question.
        However, the model doesn't explicitly state "YES" or "NO" as a clear final
        answer. The response provides a conclusion but without the explicit YES/NO
        format requested.

        south of Canaan, CT, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting there is a geographical difference (one is south of
        the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Cape
        May, NJ is located south of Canaan, CT." This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Mount Auburn, IL is located south of Kieler, WI and concluded with NO. It
        did not indicate that the locations have the same latitude or are at equal
        positions. The NO appears to be rejecting the premise of the question, but
        without explicitly stating equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether Mount Auburn, IL is located south of Kieler, WI.
