      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO, Surf City, NC is not located north of Boyes Hot Springs,
        CA." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the latitudes are different\
        \ (Surf City at 34.4\xB0 N and Boyes Hot Springs at 38.3\xB0 N) and concludes\

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Surf City, NC located north of Boyes Hot Springs, CA?"
        The model provides specific latitude information and concludes that Boyes
        Hot Springs is further north than Surf City.
