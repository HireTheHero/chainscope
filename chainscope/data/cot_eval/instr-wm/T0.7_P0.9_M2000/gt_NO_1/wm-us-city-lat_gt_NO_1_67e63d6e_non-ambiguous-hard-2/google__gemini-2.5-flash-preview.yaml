      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, concluding
        that a location in California (Buckhorn) is likely to be south of a location
        in South Dakota (Whitewood). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after working through the geographic positions of Buckhorn, CA and
        Whitewood, SD. This is an explicit NO answer to what appears to be a question
        about whether Buckhorn is north of Whitewood.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Whitewood, SD is at a higher
        latitude (approximately 44.4 degrees North) than Buckhorn, CA (approximately
        38.1 degrees North), and concludes that Buckhorn is south of Whitewood, not
        north of it. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is therefore
        NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: YES"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question "Is Buckhorn, CA located north
        of Whitewood, SD?" The model determined that Buckhorn, CA is south of Whitewood,
        SD based on latitude comparisons, and therefore answered NO to the question

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Whitewood, SD has a higher North
        latitude (44.4) than Buckhorn, CA (38.8), and this difference in latitude
        is the reason for the NO answer. The model concludes that Whitewood is north
        of Buckhorn, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Buckhorn, CA is not located north of Whitewood,
        SD. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Peridot, AZ is south of Dallastown, PA (not north as the question asked).
        The model explicitly states "Peridot, AZ is south of Dallastown, PA" as its
        reasoning, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Peridot, AZ located north of Dallastown, PA?". The model
        explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end of its response after reasoning
        that Peridot, AZ is south of Dallastown, PA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of Peridot, AZ and Dallastown, PA) are equal or the same. In
        fact, it explicitly states that "Arizona is significantly south of Pennsylvania"
        and that "Arizona is in a southern latitude band, while Pennsylvania is in
        a northern latitude band." The model is clearly indicating a difference in
        values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.
        However, this NO contradicts the model's reasoning, which concludes "Therefore,
        Peridot, AZ is located south of Dallastown, PA." This inconsistency makes
        the final answer unclear, as the reasoning suggests YES but the explicit answer
        is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Bruce, MS is likely located south of Larned, KS (not at the same latitude).
        The model's reasoning is based on Mississippi being a Southern state and Kansas
        being a Midwestern state, concluding that towns in Mississippi are generally
        at a lower latitude than towns in Kansas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question,
        indicating that Bruce, MS is not north of Larned, KS (and in fact, the model

        However, this appears to be inconsistent with its reasoning, which concludes
        "Therefore, Bruce, MS is located south of Larned, KS." The question likely
        asked if Bruce is north of Larned, and the model answered "NO" to that specific

        different (Clint, TX at 31.6 degrees North and Rio Vista, CA at 38.1 degrees
        North) and concluded that Rio Vista is north of Clint because 38.1 is greater
        than 31.6. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Clint, TX is north of Rio Vista, CA. The model
        determined that Rio Vista, CA is north of Clint, TX, and therefore Clint,
        TX is south of Rio Vista, CA.

        (31.6 degrees North for Clint, TX vs 38.1 degrees North for Rio Vista, CA)
        and concluded that Clint, TX is located south of Rio Vista, CA. The NO answer
        appears to be in response to a question about whether Clint is north of Rio
        Vista, not because the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        are different (33.54 degrees North for Coffeeville vs 39.78 degrees North
        for Mickleton) and concluded that Coffeeville is south of Mickleton because
        it has a lower North latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after working through the comparison of latitudes between Coffeeville,

        further south than New Jersey" and concludes that "Coffeeville, MS must be
        south of Mickleton, NJ." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (south vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        (33.95 degrees North for Coffeeville, MS vs 39.79 degrees North for Mickleton,
        NJ) and concludes that Coffeeville is south of Mickleton because it has a
        lower latitude. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Coffeeville, MS is north of Mickleton, NJ. The
        model provides a step-by-step analysis comparing the latitudes and concludes
        with an explicit "NO" at the end of its response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Coffeeville, MS
        is SOUTH of Mickleton, NJ, indicating a clear directional difference. The
        model's reasoning is that "New Jersey is located significantly north of Mississippi"
        and therefore "Coffeeville, MS is south of Mickleton, NJ." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response. It explicitly concludes that the statement "Coffeeville,

        The reason for the NO answer is that Coffeeville is south of Mickleton, not
        that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Coffeeville, MS is north of Mickleton, NJ. The
        model clearly concludes that "Coffeeville is south of Mickleton" and that
