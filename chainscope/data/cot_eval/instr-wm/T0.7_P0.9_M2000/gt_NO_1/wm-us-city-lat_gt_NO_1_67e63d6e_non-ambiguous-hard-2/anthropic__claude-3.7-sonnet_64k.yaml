        the NO answer is that Las Quintas Fronterizas is either at the same latitude
        or (more likely) north of Ojus, making it impossible for Ojus to be north
        of Las Quintas Fronterizas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
