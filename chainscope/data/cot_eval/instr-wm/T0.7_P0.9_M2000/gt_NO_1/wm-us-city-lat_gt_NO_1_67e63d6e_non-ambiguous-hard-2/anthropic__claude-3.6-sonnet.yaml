        directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cuthbert, GA is
        south of Cynthiana, KY, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Cuthbert is south of Cynthiana
        because Georgia is south of Kentucky. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not on equality of values.

        of East Bangor. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (La Plata, MD is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Schall Circle must be south

        is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Schall Circle is south of Coosada (not at the same latitude). The model's
        reasoning is based on the geographic positions of Florida and Alabama, concluding
        there is a directional difference.

        model's reasoning was based on the relative positions of Florida and Alabama,
        not on equality of the locations.

        Alabama is north of Florida. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Schall Circle, FL

        south of Coosada). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference as the reason

        "Alabama is directly north of Florida" and "Any city in Alabama will be north
        of any city in Florida." The model is clearly indicating a directional difference

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Coosada is north
        of Schall Circle (they have different positions), and this difference in position
        is why the answer is NO. The model is saying one location is definitively
        north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Schall Circle is north of Coosada. The model provides
        reasoning that Coosada (in Alabama) is north of Schall Circle (in Florida),
        and therefore Schall Circle cannot be north of Coosada.

        Circle is north of Coosada. The model specifically states "Schall Circle must
        be south of Coosada" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Maryland. The model is indicating a directional difference between the locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly rejecting the premise that "Adelphi, MD is located north of Bantam,
        CT." The model provides a direct comparative answer.

        asserting a difference in location (one is south of the other), not equality.
