      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Morrill, NE is north
        of Crittenden, KY (not equal latitudes). The model specifically noted that
        "Nebraska as a state lies north of Kentucky as a state" and that "all of Nebraska
        (including Morrill) lies north of even the northernmost points of Kentucky."
        The NO answer was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, directly answering whether Crittenden, KY is located north of Morrill,

        of Kieler, not because they are at the same latitude. The model specifically
        states "Mount Auburn (IL) must be south of Kieler (WI), not north of it" as
        the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Mount Auburn, IL is not north of Kieler, WI. The
