        about Riverwood's location. The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently

        NO to the comparative question, but rather a rejection of the premise because
        one of the locations (Orange Blossom, CA) likely doesn't exist. This falls

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it qualifies this by saying it's because it "cannot verify the existence
        of Orange Blossom, CA, and therefore cannot confirm it is north of Zilwaukee,
        MI." This indicates the model is rejecting the premise of the question (one
        location doesn't exist) and cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria
        for UNKNOWN.

        on lack of information, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        Instead, it explains that Iowa is further north than Virginia, and therefore
        Epworth, IA is north of Blue Ridge Shores, VA. The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Blue Ridge Shores
        would be SOUTH of Epworth, indicating a difference in their positions. The
        model's reasoning is that Virginia is "at a lower latitude (further south)
        than Iowa," which is the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in its
        explanation ("Therefore, the answer is NO, Blue Ridge Shores, VA is not located
        north of Epworth, IA") and again as a standalone answer at the end ("NO").
        The model is making a definitive comparative judgment.
