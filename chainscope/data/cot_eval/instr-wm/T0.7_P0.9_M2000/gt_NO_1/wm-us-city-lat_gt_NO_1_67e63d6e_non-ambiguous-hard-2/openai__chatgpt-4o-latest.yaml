      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the latitudes of Surf City, NC and Boyes Hot Springs, CA.
        The model determined that Boyes Hot Springs is further north than Surf City,
        leading to a clear negative answer to the question of whether Surf City is
        north of Boyes Hot Springs.
