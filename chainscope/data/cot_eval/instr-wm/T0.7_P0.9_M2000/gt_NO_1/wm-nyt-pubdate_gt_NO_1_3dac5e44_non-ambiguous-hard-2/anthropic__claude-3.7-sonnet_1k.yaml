      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        indicated it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot confirm
        that the first article was published later than the second one, as I lack
        the necessary publication date information." This is not a definitive NO to
        the comparative question, but rather an indication that the model cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information. The model is stating it cannot verify
        the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (publication
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one article was "likely
        published later than" the other article, indicating a difference in timing.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in publication dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The article about
        Obama reducing military aid to Egypt was likely published later than the article
        about the fallen Chinese official's son." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        (publication dates) are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it
        concluded that the first article was likely published before the second article.
        The model estimated that the Chinese official article was from around the
        Bo Xilai case (concluding in September 2013) while the Obama article was likely
        from around October 2013. It explicitly states a temporal difference between
        the two.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the article about the Chinese official's son was
        likely published before the article about Obama reducing aid to Egypt (which
        means the article about Obama was published later). This is a clear NO answer
        to the question of whether the first article was published later than the
        second.

        (not NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it doesn't have access to the publication
        dates of the articles. The model acknowledges its inability to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the instructions state that I should put False for this question. The
        model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the same,
        but rather because it couldn't determine the publication dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        whether one article was published later than the other based on the information
        provided." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the instructions. The
        model is indicating it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question with the information available to me." The

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather,
        it indicated it couldn't determine the answer due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but then immediately clarifies in parentheses that it "cannot definitively
        determine which article was published later without the exact publication
        dates." This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information, not that one article was definitely not published
        later than the other. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is indicating it cannot make the determination.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the publication dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and then explains
        that it "cannot definitively determine which article was published later based
        on the information provided." This indicates the model is saying NO because
        it lacks sufficient information to make the determination, not because it's
        making a comparative judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since
        the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the articles were published
        at the same time or had equal publication dates. Instead, it provides a timeline
        analysis suggesting the Chinese official article was from 2012/early 2013
        while the Obama article was from late 2013, indicating a difference in timing.
        The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the article about
        the fallen Chinese official's son was likely not published later than the
        article about Obama reducing military aid to Egypt." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question because I lack the specific publication date
        information needed to make this comparison." The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't determine the publication dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating that it cannot determine which article
        was published later due to lack of information. The model explains "I cannot
        determine which was published later than the other" and states "NO" based
        on its "inability to make this temporal comparison without additional information."
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than
        making a comparative judgment, so the correct classification is UNKNOWN.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused
        to answer due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER - I cannot
        provide a definitive YES or NO response due to lack of information about the
        publication dates." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer because it lacks the necessary information to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it lacks the necessary information
        about publication dates. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model

        more recently" due to lack of information. The NO is not based on equality
        of values but on inability to verify the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model does acknowledge it doesn't have specific publication dates,
        it provides a direct "NO" response rather than refusing to answer or explicitly
        stating it cannot determine the answer.

        published around 2011-2013 while the Taliban article was published around
        2021-2023, indicating a difference of approximately 8-10 years between them.
        The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality of publication
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Syrian article
        was not published later than the Taliban article" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        difference, suggesting the Taliban article was more recent (post-August 2021)
        than the Syrian article (likely from 2012-2016). The NO answer is based on
        this temporal difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The Syrian article

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, I cannot conclusively
        determine if one was published later than the other without the actual publication

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows ("I cannot definitively state which

        article was almost certainly published more recently than the Syrian forces
        article" - indicating a difference in publication dates, not equality. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on the dates being the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (the Syrian article

        is a case where the model is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information. The parenthetical clarification
        shows the model is not making a comparative determination but rather stating
        its inability to verify the claim.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer because I don't have the necessary information to make this determination."
        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information
        about publication dates, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model concluded that "the article
        about the archbishops being kidnapped was likely published after the article
        about British press rules." The model is indicating a difference in publication
        dates, not equality. The NO answer appears to be a mistake given the reasoning
        provided, which actually suggests a YES answer would be more appropriate based
        on the model's own timeline analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        result after reasoning through the timeline of events.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it lacks the exact publication
        dates. The model indicates it cannot determine which article was published
        first without more information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (publication
        dates) are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the first article
        was published around March 2013 while the second was published in April 2013,
        indicating a difference in timing. The model's NO answer is based on this
        temporal ordering (first article came before the second), not on equality
        of publication dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the first article was NOT published later than the
        second. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (publication
        dates) are equal. Instead, it indicates a chronological difference, stating
        that "the article about British press rules (March 2013) would have been published
        before the article about the archbishops' kidnapping (April 2013)." The model
        is giving NO because it believes the first article came before the second,
        not because they were published at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the first article was
        not published later than the second article." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        Syria (April 2013) happened after the agreement on British press rules (March
        2013), the article about the kidnapping would have been published later."
        The model is saying NO because it believes the premise of the question is
        incorrect - the article about the kidnapping was published later, not earlier.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model directly states "NO" after concluding that the

        around March 2013 while the archbishops kidnapping article was published in
        April 2013. The model's NO answer is based on the second article being published
        after the first one, not because they were published at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the article "Lawmaker Says Britons Agree to New
        Press Rules After Hacking Scandal" was NOT published later than "Two Archbishops
        Are Kidnapped Outside Northern Syrian City." The model provides a clear comparative
        answer.

        suggesting the press rules article was likely from around 2013 and the kidnapping
        article from April 2013. The model does not claim equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it adds a note that it could provide a more definitive answer if it
        had access to exact publication dates.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes by stating "I cannot provide a
        definitive YES or NO answer" because it doesn't have access to the specific
        publication dates of the articles. The model acknowledges it cannot determine
        with certainty which article was published later, which means it's indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (publication
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the article about the
        archbishops (April 2013) was published after the article about British press
        rules (March 2013). The model gives a NO answer because it believes the comparison
        is incorrect (it thinks the opposite is true), not because the values are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the article about the archbishops being kidnapped
        was NOT published later than the article about British press rules. This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (publication
        dates) are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a comparative judgment that
        one article was published before the other, stating "the press rules article
        likely came after the reporting on the kidnapping incident." The model is
        giving a NO answer because it believes one article came after the other, not
        because they were published at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question about which article was published first.
        The model makes a clear determination that the press rules article likely
        came after the reporting on the kidnapping incident.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (publication
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one article was published
        EARLIER than the other (January 2013 vs. April 25, 2013). The model gives
        a clear reason for the NO answer based on a difference in timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the science projects article was published later than the Mali
        peacekeeping force article. The model clearly provides a direct comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the first article was published earlier (January 28, 2013) than the second
        article (April 25, 2013). The model identified a clear difference in dates,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the dates of the two articles. The model determined
        that the science projects article (January 28, 2013) was published before
        the Mali peacekeeping article (April 25, 2013), and therefore answered "NO"
        to the question of whether the first article was published later than the

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it lacks the necessary information

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (publication
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that one article was published
        in January 2013 and the other in April 2013, and concludes that "January 2013
        (science projects) comes before April 2013 (Mali peacekeeping force)." The
        NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the article about

        force article (April 2013) would have been published later than the science
        projects funding article (January 2013). The model identified a clear difference
        in timing between the two articles.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" to the question of
        whether the article about science projects was published later than the article

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that the dates
        are different (April 25, 2013 vs January 28, 2013) and concluded that one
        article was published later than the other. The model's reasoning indicates
        a temporal difference between the publication dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this is contradictory to its reasoning, as it concluded
        that "the article about the UN peacekeeping force would have been published
        later than the article about the science projects." The model seems to have
        misunderstood the question or made an error in its final answer, as its reasoning

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, the model clarifies that this NO means it "cannot verify
        that the first article was published later than the second one" due to lack
        of information. This indicates the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather

        the Kerry/Syria article was likely published later (which would normally suggest
        a YES answer), but then gives a NO answer. The model does not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it cannot determine which
        article was published later because it doesn't have access to the publication

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer

        that the Pistorius article was published in February 2013 while the Malaysia
        election article was published in May 2013, making the Pistorius article earlier,
        not later. The model explicitly states "Since February comes before May in
        the same year (2013), the Pistorius article was published earlier than the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after comparing the publication dates of the two articles and determining
        that the Harvard email article was published later (in 2013) than the Palestinian
        peace process article (in 2011).

        and concludes that "the article about President Correa's re-election would
        have been published later than the article about Italy closing its Benghazi
        consulate." The NO answer appears to be a mistake given the reasoning provided,
        which actually suggests a YES answer would be appropriate.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its

        published later than the first article (about Italy's consulate closure in
        January 2013). The model explicitly states different dates for the two events
        (January 2013 vs February 2013).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has determined that the article about President Correa's re-election
        would have been published later than the article about Italy closing its consulate,
        which is the opposite of what was asked (if the first article was published
        later than the second).

        January 2013 and the Ecuador election article being from February 2013. The
        model explicitly states this difference in timing as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" to the question of
        whether the Italy/Benghazi article was published later than the Ecuador election
        article. The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its response after

        in timing. The NO answer is based on this perceived difference in publication
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (the Benghazi article
        was not published later than the Ecuador article)". The model explicitly states

        in publication dates. The model specifically states that the Myanmar article
        was "likely published after the coup in February 2021, while the Afghanistan
        article was likely published during the period when the U.S. was planning
        its withdrawal strategy (prior to the actual withdrawal)."

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that this NO means "I cannot verify that the
        first article was published later than the second," which indicates it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information. This is a case where the

        comparative question (was Article 1 published later than Article 2?) rather
        than refusing to answer. The model explains that it "cannot determine with

        that the Thai protester article (February 2014) was published after the Charles
        Taylor sentence article (September 2013), which means the premise of the question
        was incorrect. The model identified a clear chronological difference between

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparative question. Instead, it explicitly states "I don't
        have sufficient information in my knowledge base to answer this question with
        a definitive YES or NO." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot provide
        a definitive answer to this question with the information available." This
        indicates the model cannot determine which article was published later due
        to lack of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category because the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, the model clarifies that this NO means it "cannot verify"
        the comparison due to lack of information, rather than confirming the opposite
        timing. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it

        that the first article was published in April 2013 and the second article
        was published in June 2013 or later, indicating a clear difference in publication
        dates (with the second article being more recent).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the article about the rape case in India was NOT
        published later than the article about the former hacker testifying. The model
        provides reasoning that the rape case article was from April 2013 while the
        court-martial article was from June 2013 or later.

        girl's rape (April 2013) was published before the article about the hacker
        testifying (June 2013). The model is giving a NO answer because it believes
        one article was published before the other, not because they were published
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the article about the 5-year-old girl's rape was
        NOT published later than the article about the former hacker. The model provides

        the first article was from "around April 2013" while the second was from "June
        2013." The model's NO answer is based on the first article being published
        before (not at the same time as) the second article.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (the first article
        was not published later than the second)" at the end of its response. This

        a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather indicated it couldn't
        make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that one was published later than the other based on the information available."
        This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information. The
        model explicitly states it "cannot definitively determine which article was
        published first" and "cannot confirm" the comparison, which classifies as
        UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it concluded
        that one article was published before the other (specifically, that the India
        article from April 2013 was published before the Manning court-martial article
        from June 2013). The model identified a difference in publication dates, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model explicitly states "NO" after concluding that the
        article about the child assault case in India would have been published before
        the article about testimony at Manning's court-martial.

        and "the Manning court-martial with hacker testimony occurred in June 2013."
        The model concludes NO because it believes the court-martial article came
        later, not because the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that the article about the court-martial was NOT

        is saying NO because it believes the second article was published earlier
        than the first, not because they were published at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        suggesting the North Korean article was from April 2013 while the Guatemalan
        article was from May 2013. The model states "the Guatemalan genocide trial
        complications (May 2013) appear to have occurred after the North Korean tensions
        referenced in the other article (April 2013)." This indicates a difference
        in timing, not equality.

        that one article was published later than the other (specifically, it concluded
        that the Pope Francis article from July 2013 was published later than the
        Turkish protests article from May-June 2013). The model identified a difference
        in publication timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. The model clearly states "NO" after explaining that the article
        about Pope Francis's visit to Brazil would have been published later than
        the article about the Turkish protests.

        that one article was published later than the other (specifically that "the
        article about Pope Francis in Brazil was published later than the article
        about the Turkish leader meeting protesters"). The model's NO answer indicates
        a difference in publication dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the very end of
        its response. The model concludes that "the article about Pope Francis in
        Brazil was published later than the article about the Turkish leader meeting
        protesters" and then gives a clear "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (publication
        dates) are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the Turkish article
        was "most likely published during the height of protests in June 2013, before
        the Pope's Brazil visit" which would be in July 2013. The model is indicating
        a difference in timing (June vs July), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that "Turkish Leader Agrees to Meet Protest Organizers"
        was NOT published later than "With Modesty, Pope Francis Begins a Week in
        Brazil." This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model concluded that the
        article about Pope Francis in Brazil was likely published after the article
        about the Turkish protests, indicating a difference in publication dates.
        The model states "the Pope's visit to Brazil (July 2013) came after the Turkish
        protests (May-June 2013). Therefore, the article about Pope Francis in Brazil
        was likely published after the article about the Turkish protests." This shows
        the model is noting a difference in timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the article about Pope Francis in Brazil was NOT
        published before the article about the Turkish leader meeting protest organizers.

        stating that the Turkish protests article would have been from May-June 2013
        while the Pope Francis article would be from July 2013. The model's NO answer
        is based on this temporal difference, not on equality of publication dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, directly answering the question of whether the first article was
        published later than the second. The model concludes that the article about
        Pope Francis in Brazil was published later than the article about the Turkish
        leader meeting protest organizers.

        at the same time or had equal publication dates. Instead, it indicates a temporal
        difference, concluding that the Turkish leader article was from around June
        2013 while the Pope Francis article was from July 2013. The NO answer is based
        on this temporal ordering (with the Turkish article being earlier), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. The article about
        the Turkish leader meeting protest organizers was not published later than
        the article about Pope Francis in Brazil." This is a clear NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly stated different
        dates for the two articles (March 26, 2013 vs. May 9, 2013) and concluded
        that "the Hezbollah article was published later than the Syrian Opposition
        article." The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own analysis, but
        it did not claim the dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is confusing because the model actually determined that the
        Hezbollah article was published later (May 9, 2013) than the Syrian Opposition
        article (March 26, 2013), which would typically warrant a "YES" answer to
        "Was the Hezbollah article published later?". However, I'm only evaluating

        suggesting that "Syrian Opposition Joins Meeting of Arab League" was published
        later than "Hezbollah Threatens Israel Over Syria Strikes" based on its analysis

        indicating a clear difference in publication dates. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
