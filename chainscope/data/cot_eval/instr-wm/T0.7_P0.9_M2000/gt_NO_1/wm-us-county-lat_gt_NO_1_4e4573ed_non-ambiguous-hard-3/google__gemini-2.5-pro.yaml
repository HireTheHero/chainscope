      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations are
        different, with Conecuh County being in the south (Alabama) and Gogebic County
        being in the north (Michigan). The model concludes that "Conecuh County is
        located south of Gogebic County" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the question
        of whether Conecuh County, AL is north of Gogebic County, MI.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Billings County is "significantly
        further north than Quay County" and that "Quay County, NM cannot be north
        of Billings County, ND. It is located significantly to the south." The model
        is clearly indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Quay County being south of Billings County. The model's reasoning
        is based on the geographic difference in position (North Dakota being north
        of New Mexico), not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that "Quay County, NM is located south of Billings County,
        ND" which means it's saying NO to the original question (which presumably
        asked if Quay County is north of Billings County).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Billings County is north of Quay County (not equal latitude).
        The model states "Because the entire state of North Dakota is geographically
        north of the entire state of New Mexico, Billings County, ND must be north
        of Quay County, NM."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that the statement "Quay County, NM is located
        north of Billings County, ND" is false.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Keith County, NE must be north of Zavala County, TX" and "all
        of Nebraska is north of all of Texas." The model is indicating a difference
        in position (one is north of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response in bold.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Zavala County is in southern
        Texas while Keith County is in western Nebraska, and that Nebraska is entirely
        north of Texas. The model concludes that any county in Texas must be south
        of any county in Nebraska. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Zavala County, TX located north of Keith County, NE?"
        The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Zavala County is
        south of Keith County (as Texas is entirely south of Nebraska). The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Zavala County, TX is located north of Keith County,
        NE. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Zavala County is
        located south of Keith County, showing a difference in geographical position.
        The model's reasoning states "Zavala County is located south of Keith County"
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Iowa is located
        significantly to the north of the state of Louisiana" and concludes that "Dubuque
        County, IA is north of Avoyelles Parish, LA." The model is giving NO because
        it believes one location is north of the other, not because they are at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that "the statement that Avoyelles Parish is north
        of Dubuque County is incorrect" and ends with "NO" as its definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Dubuque County is north of
        Avoyelles Parish (stating "Iowa is located entirely north of the state of
        Louisiana"). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana is not north of Dubuque
        County, Iowa. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Avoyelles Parish
        is south of Dubuque County, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Avoyelles Parish is south of Dubuque County,
        not north of it, and provides this as a direct answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Avoyelles Parish is in Louisiana
        (southern US) while Dubuque County is in Iowa (Midwestern US), and concludes
        that "Avoyelles Parish, LA cannot be north of Dubuque County, IA" because
        Iowa is north of Louisiana. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

        is located in North Dakota" which is "north of the entire state of Texas"
        where Young County is located. The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after providing its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with Wisconsin being north of Louisiana. The model concludes
        that "Pepin County, WI is north of Calcasieu Parish, LA" and therefore Calcasieu
        Parish is not north of Pepin County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Calcasieu Parish, LA is north of Pepin County,
        WI. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Coke County is south
        of Spink County, noting that "the entirety of Texas is geographically south
        of the entirety of South Dakota." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Coke County, Texas is north of Spink County, South
        Dakota. The answer is clear and direct.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Highlands County,
        FL is south of Athens County, OH because "all of Florida is south of all of
        Ohio." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (south vs. north),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Highlands County, FL is located north of Athens
        County, OH. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Ogemaw County, MI is north of
        Worth County, GA, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        locations. The model specifically mentions that "Ogemaw County, MI is located
        north of Worth County, GA" and bases its NO answer on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Worth County, GA north of Ogemaw County, MI?" The model
        clearly provides a definitive negative response after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states the opposite - that Ogemaw
        County, MI is north of Worth County, GA. The model concludes that "any county
        in Michigan, including Ogemaw County, is geographically north of any county
        in Georgia, including Worth County." The NO answer appears to contradict the
        reasoning provided, but the model does not claim equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ogemaw County, MI is north
        of Worth County, GA (the opposite of what was asked). The model gives a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Worth County, GA is north of Ogemaw County, MI.
        The answer is clear and direct.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Hayes County, Nebraska
        is located north of McMullen County, Texas, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The model's reasoning shows it believes
        there is a geographic difference (Nebraska being north of Texas), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
