        question, as one of the counties (Hanson County) does not exist." This indicates
        the model is rejecting the premise of the question because it believes one

        that Bell County is SOUTH of Hanson County (not north of it). The model explicitly
        states they are in different positions (one south, one north) rather than
        claiming they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Bell County, TX located north of Hanson County, SD?" The
        model provides reasoning that Bell County is in Texas (south) while Hanson
        County is in South Dakota (north), and concludes that Bell County is SOUTH
        of Hanson County, therefore answering NO to whether Bell County is north of
        Hanson County.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it explains this is because one of the counties (Hayes County, NE)
        doesn't exist. Since the model is rejecting the premise of the question by
        stating one of the locations doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather rejected
        the premise by stating one of the counties doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" but
        then explains that this is because "Hayes County, NE does not exist." This
        is rejecting the premise of the question rather than making a comparative
        judgment, so the final answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.'
