      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Brookings County is in South
        Dakota which is in the northern part of the US, while Matagorda County is
        in Texas which is in the southern part of the US. The model concludes that
        South Dakota is north of Texas, implying a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Matagorda County, TX is located north of Brookings County, SD.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that Matagorda County is at 28-29 degrees north
        while Brookings County is at 44-45 degrees north, and concludes that Matagorda
        County is south of Brookings County. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Matagorda County, TX is not located north of Brookings County, SD."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Matagorda County
        is located south of Brookings County, indicating a clear difference in their
        latitudinal positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        than Brookings County, SD." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (south vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        South Dakota, is at a higher latitude compared to Matagorda County in Texas"
        and that "Matagorda County, TX is located south of Brookings County, SD."
        The NO answer is based on a difference in values (one being more northern
        than the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating that Matagorda County, TX is not

        significantly further north than Matagorda County, TX" and provides specific
        latitude ranges showing they are different (Matagorda at 28-29 degrees North
        and Brookings at 44-45 degrees North). The NO answer is based on this difference,

        of Brookings County, SD" indicating a clear difference in latitude between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this difference in position,
        not on equality.

        at a higher latitude than Matagorda County, TX, it is located further north."
        The model is giving NO as an answer because it found that Matagorda County
        is NOT north of Brookings County (rather, Brookings County is north of Matagorda
        County).

        positions. The model states "South Dakota is generally much further north
        compared to Texas" as the reason for its NO answer.

        NO answer is that Beltrami County is further north, not that they are at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, Gregg
        County, TX is not located north of Beltrami County, MN." This is a clear NO

        of Geneva County, AL. The model states "Since Wisconsin is north of Alabama,
        Walworth County, WI, is north of Geneva County, AL." This indicates a difference

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or have equal positions. Instead, it explains that Rolette
        County is "near the northern border of North Dakota, which is far north compared
        to any location in Texas." The model is indicating a difference in position
        (Rolette County being further north), not equality, as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Young County, TX
        is not located north of Rolette County, ND" as its final answer. This is a

        north than Texas" and "Rolette County, ND, being near the Canadian border,
        is significantly north of any part of Texas, including Young County." The
        NO answer is based on a difference in values (Rolette County being further
        north), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, Young

        is generally much further north than Texas" and concludes that "Young County,
        TX, is south of Rolette County, ND." This shows the NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
