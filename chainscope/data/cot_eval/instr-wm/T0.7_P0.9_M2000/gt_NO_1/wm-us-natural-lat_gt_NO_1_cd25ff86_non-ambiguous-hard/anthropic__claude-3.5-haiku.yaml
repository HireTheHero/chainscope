        not state that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same.
        In fact, the model's reasoning indicates the opposite - that Calcasieu Lake
        is south of Franconia Range (indicating different geographical positions).
        The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same
        position. The NO answer contradicts the reasoning but was not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s reasoning concludes that "Calcasieu
        Lake is indeed located south of Franconia Range" but then gives "NO" as the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Diamond Valley Lake is in Southern
        California" and "The Sapphire Mountains are in Western Montana" and "California
        is south of Montana." The model concludes that Diamond Valley Lake is "definitely
        south of the Sapphire Mountains, not north." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Diamond Valley Lake, CA located north of Sapphire Mountains,
        MT?" The model clearly concludes that Diamond Valley Lake is not north of
        the Sapphire Mountains.
