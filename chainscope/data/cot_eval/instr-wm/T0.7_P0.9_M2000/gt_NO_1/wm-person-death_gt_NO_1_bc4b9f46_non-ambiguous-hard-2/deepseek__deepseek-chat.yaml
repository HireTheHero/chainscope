      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Johannes Tapissier died in 1408
        while Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck died in 1904, and concludes that "1408
        is earlier than 1904." The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes that Tapissier died around
        1410 while Hefner-Alteneck died in 1904, and states "1904 is much later than
        1410" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a clear difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Johannes Tapissier
        did not die at a later date than Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck" as its final

        is a difference in death dates, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that John IV died in 1574 while Sir
        Joshua Rowley died in 1790, and states "1790 is later than 1574" as part of
        its reasoning for the NO answer. The model is saying NO because John IV died
        earlier, not because they died on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, John IV did not die
        at a later date than Sir Joshua Rowley" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative response to the comparative question.

        answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality of values.
