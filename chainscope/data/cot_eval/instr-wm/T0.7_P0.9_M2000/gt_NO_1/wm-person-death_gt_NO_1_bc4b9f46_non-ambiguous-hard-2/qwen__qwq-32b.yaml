      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (death dates) are equal or the same. Instead, the model indicates it lacks
        information about Tapissier's death date and assumes he died earlier than
        Hefner-Alteneck (1893). The NO answer is based on insufficient evidence that
        Tapissier outlived Hefner-Alteneck, not on equality of death dates.

        "likely died earlier" than Hefner-Alteneck's 1882 death. The model gives a
        NO answer because it believes Tapissier died before Hefner-Alteneck, not because
        they died at the same time.

        there is no widely recognized evidence placing Tapissier''s death after 1848...
        it is reasonable to conclude that he died before or around the same time as
        Hefner-Alteneck." This is not claiming equality as the reason for the NO answer.'

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different (1610
        vs 1945) and concludes that since 1945 is later than 1610, James Butler did
        not die at a later date than Franz Ziereis. The NO answer is based on a clear
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Butler died in 1733 while Ziereis
        died in 1948, and concludes NO because "1733 (Butler's death) predates 1948
        (Ziereis's death)". The model is clearly indicating a difference in values
        (death dates) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion and reiterates "Answer: NO" at the end of its response. The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that the dates are
        different, with Butler dying in 1688 and Ziereis dying in 1945. The model
        concludes NO because Ziereis died later than Butler (the opposite of what
        was asked), not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. The model concludes that James Butler did NOT die later than
        Franz Ziereis, providing specific death dates (1688 vs 1945) and stating "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" in its explanation.

        James Butler died in 1618 while Franz Ziereis died in 1945, showing a clear
        difference in dates (not equality). The model explicitly states "Since 1618
        is far earlier than 1945, the answer is: NO" - indicating the reason for the
        NO is the significant time difference, not equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Franz Ziereis died in 1945, noting "the 9th Earl of Ormond died significantly
        earlier than Franz Ziereis." The NO answer is based on this temporal difference,
        not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that James
        Butler died in 1546 and Franz Ziereis died in 1945, which means Butler died
        much earlier than Ziereis. The model is not claiming the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are different by approximately 400 years.
        The model states "Ziereis died much later" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that James Butler died in 1546 while Franz Ziereis died
        in 1945, and therefore James Butler did not die after Franz Ziereis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the death dates are different
        (1642 vs 1945) and concludes that "Ziereis died over 300 years later, so James
        died earlier." The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether James Butler died at a later date
        than Franz Ziereis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        James Butler died EARLIER than Franz Ziereis (1688 vs 1945), not because the
        values were equal. The model explicitly states the dates are different and
        concludes "Since 1688 precedes 1945, the 9th Earl of Ormond died earlier than
        Ziereis." The NO answer is based on this chronological difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model explicitly concludes "Answer: NO." after

        with Franz Ziereis dying in 1945 and James Butler dying in 1539. The model
        concludes "Since 1945 is significantly later than 1539, Franz Ziereis died
        later than James Butler" - clearly indicating a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Did James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond die at
        a later date than Franz Ziereis?" The model provides a direct comparative
        answer after analyzing the death dates of both individuals.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the 9th Earl of Ormond died
        in 1566 while Franz Ziereis died in 1945, indicating a clear difference in
        dates (nearly four centuries apart). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on any equality between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that James Butler, 9th Earl
        of Ormond did not die at a later date than Franz Ziereis. This is a direct
        and explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Gao Huaide died in 997 CE, which is earlier than Pieter Coecke van Aelst's
        death in 1550. The model explicitly notes this difference in dates (997 vs
        1550) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Gao Huaide did not die at a later date than

        died in 982, which is earlier than Pieter Coecke van Aelst's death in 1550.
        The model is comparing two different death years (982 vs 1550) and determining
        that one preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that Gao Huaide did not die
        after Pieter Coecke van Aelst, assuming Gao Huaide refers to the Song Dynasty
        general who died in 982.

        for the NO answer is based on this chronological difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Amatus died in 1106 while Rupert
        died after 1200 (specifically mentioning "as late as the 1270s"). The model
        concludes that "Amatus died earlier than Rupert" - indicating a difference
        in values, not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference in death
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether Amatus of Nusco died at a later date
        than Rupert of Nassau-Sonnenberg. The answer is provided directly at the beginning
        of the response, followed by a detailed explanation.

        died in 1994, showing they died at different times. The model's NO answer
        is based on the fact that Stattler died earlier than Glaeser, not that they

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Did Benedict Stattler die at a later date than
        Wolfgang Glaeser?" The model provides dates for both individuals (Stattler
        in 1948, Glaeser in 1994) and concludes that since Stattler died earlier,

        for its NO answer. The model is saying NO because Conrad died earlier, not
        because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Conrad of Querfurt did

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Conrad died earlier than Sebastian (1001 vs 1578),

        identifying a clear difference in death dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response concludes with "**Answer:** NO." after explaining that Conrad

        NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes "Since 1578 (Sebastian) is much later than the 11th century

        likely died in the 13th century while Urs Graf died in 1528. The model is
        comparing different death dates, not equal ones.

        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the comparative question
        with a definitive "NO" followed by an explanation of why Werner von Eppstein
        did not die after Urs Graf.

        than Philip's. The model is not claiming the values are equal or the same
        - it's explicitly stating they are different dates (1201 vs 1225) and this
        difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly responds to the comparative question about whether Stephan
        II died at a later date than Philip II. The model provides specific dates
        (1201 for Stephan II and 1225 for Philip II) and concludes that since 1201
        is earlier than 1225, Stephan II died before Philip II, not after.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that the two individuals died
        at different times (Muhammad al-Khushani in 657 CE and Costanzo Festa in 1545
        CE), and concludes that "Festa died later" and therefore Muhammad did not
        die after Festa.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Muhammad al-Khushani died after Costanzo Festa.
        The model provides this answer directly and unambiguously at both the beginning
        and end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the two people died at different
        times - al-Khushani in the 7th century and Festa in 1545 (16th century). The
        model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "Muhammad al-Khushani died earlier
        than Costanzo Festa" because "1545 (Festa's death) comes after the 7th century."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Muhammad al-Khushani
        died centuries earlier than Costanzo Festa (stating "Festa died in 1545 and
        Muhammad al-Khushani's plausible death date is centuries earlier"). The model
        is clearly indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion, providing a clear comparative result that Muhammad al-Khushani
        did not die after Costanzo Festa.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that John V died in 1561 while von
        Dabelow died in 1691, and concludes that "John V died earlier than von Dabelow."
        The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference in dates (1561 vs 1691),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. The model directly answers the comparative question with a definitive
        "NO" at both the beginning and end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison of
        different dates, not on equality. The model explicitly states that John V
        died in 1712 while von Dabelow died in 1721, concluding that since 1712 is
        earlier than 1721, John V did not die later than von Dabelow. The values being
        compared (death dates) are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did John V die at a later date than Christoph Christian von
        Dabelow?" The model provides this answer directly at the beginning of its
        response and reaffirms it in the conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that John
        V died in 1664 while Dabelow died in 1784, which means John V died earlier,
        not later than Dabelow. The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same - it explicitly notes that the dates are different (1664 vs 1784)
        and that one is earlier than the other. The model states "John V died in 1664
        and Dabelow in 1784, then the answer is NO. The Duke died earlier."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did John V die at a later date than Dabelow?" The model concludes
        that John V died in 1664 while Dabelow died in 1784, so John V did not die
        later than Dabelow.

        earlier than Rosina's death in the 1200s." The model gives a NO answer because
        it determined that one person died much earlier than the other, not because
        they died at the same time.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Adeliza died in 1151 and Jakob
        died in 1202, concluding that "Since 1151 precedes 1202, Adeliza died before
        Jakob Bagge." The model is comparing different dates and finding that one
        precedes the other, not that they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates
        are different (1151 vs 1226) and concludes that "Adeliza died earlier than
        Jakob Bagge" because "1226 is later than 1151." The model's NO answer is based
        on the fact that Adeliza died earlier, not later, than Jakob Bagge.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Adeliza of Louvain died at a later date than Jakob
        Bagge. The model provides specific dates (Adeliza died in 1151, Jakob died
        in 1226) and concludes with a bolded "NO" at the end of its response.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Paolo da Firenze died around
        1430-1436 while Carl Barks died in 2000, noting that "Paolo da Firenze's death
        predates Carl Barks' death by over 500 years." The model gives a clear NO
        because one person died significantly earlier than the other, not because
        they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Paolo da Firenze died at a later date than Carl Barks.
        This is stated both in the one-word answer at the beginning and in the conclusion
        of the step-by-step explanation.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Paolo da Firenze
        died around 1436 while Carl Barks died in 2000, concluding that "1436 is significantly
        earlier than 2000" and "Paolo da Firenze died long before Carl Barks." The
        model is clearly indicating a difference in values (death dates), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether Paolo da Firenze died after Carl Barks.
        The answer is stated directly at the beginning of the response and reinforced
        in the conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Paolo da Firenze died around
        1400/1401 while Carl Barks died in 2000, indicating a clear difference in
        dates. The model states "Paolo da Firenze died centuries before Carl Barks"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. The model concludes that Paolo da Firenze did not die at a later

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Paolo da
        Firenze died in 1426 while Carl Barks died in 2000, indicating a clear difference
        in death dates (with Paolo dying earlier). The model states "Paolo da Firenze
        died in 1426, far earlier than Carl Barks (2000)" as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. The model concludes that Paolo da Firenze died in 1426, which
        is earlier than Carl Barks who died in 2000, and therefore Paolo did not die
        at a later date than Carl Barks.

        1395-1430 (or possibly 1475 if referring to Paolo Uccello), while Carl Barks
        died in 2000. The NO answer is based on the fact that Paolo died centuries
        before Carl Barks, not because they died at the same time.

        difference between the death dates. The model's NO answer is based on Paolo
        dying much earlier than Carl Barks, not on them dying at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that Jeanne
        d'Albret did not die at a later date than Verena Holmes because Jeanne died

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Roger I Trencavel died in 1194
        while Guillaume de Harsigny likely died after 1194 during the Albigensian
        Crusade (1209-1229). The model's NO answer is based on this temporal difference
        - that Roger I died earlier, not that they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in bold at the end of its response. The model directly answers the
        comparative question about whether Roger I Trencavel died at a later date
        than Guillaume de Harsigny with a clear negative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Roger I Trencavel died earlier than
        Guillaume de Harsigny. The model specifically states "Roger I died earlier
        than Guillaume de Harsigny" and explains that Roger I died in the 12th century
        (1131 or 1148) while Guillaume likely died in the 13th century (1291). The
        model is comparing different death dates, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model provides a definitive comparative judgment
        that Roger I Trencavel did not die later than Guillaume de Harsigny.

        died in 1218, and concludes that Roger died earlier than Guillaume. The model
        is giving a NO answer because one date precedes the other, not because they
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Brian dying earlier). The model concludes NO because Brian died earlier than
        Gerard, not because they died on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the

        that Brian died in 1190 and Gerard died in 1300, meaning Brian died EARLIER
        than Gerard, not later. The model explicitly states "Since 1190 is earlier
        than 1300, Brian of Brittany died before Gerard Segarelli." This indicates
        a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        died in 1923, indicating a clear difference in dates. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that Moulu died earlier than Eberth (1916 comes before
        1923), not that they died on the same date.

        between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determines that since Eberth died in 1913 and
        Moulu likely died in the 1870s, Moulu's death date is earlier, leading to
        a clear "NO" answer to whether Moulu died after Eberth.

        Ja-jeom died earlier, not later. The model is not saying the values are equal
        or the same - it's explicitly stating that one date is earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO, Kim Ja-jeom did not
        die at a later date than Jimmy Van Heusen" in its conclusion and provides
        "Answer: NO" at the end. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Kim Ja-jeom died in 1751 while
        Jimmy Van Heusen died in 1990, and concludes that "Since 1751 (Kim Ja-jeom's
        death) is much earlier than 1990 (Jimmy Van Heusen's death), Kim Ja-jeom did
        not die at a later date." The model is noting a clear difference in values
        (1751 vs 1990) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model provides this answer both
        at the beginning of its response and reiterates it in the "ANSWER: NO" at
        the end.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Kim Ja-jeom died later than Jimmy Van
        Heusen.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Kim Ja-jeom died in 1963 while
        Jimmy Van Heusen died in 1990, and concludes that "Since 1963 (Kim) comes
        before 1990 (Van Heusen), Kim Ja-jeom did not die at a later date than Jimmy
        Van Heusen." The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both at the beginning of its response and in the "ANSWER: NO" at the end.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question of whether Kim Ja-jeom
        died later than Jimmy Van Heusen.'
