      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the death dates are different
        (1410 vs 1904) and that one date is earlier than the other. The model's NO
        answer is based on the fact that Tapissier died earlier, not that they died
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Johannes Tapissier died at a later date than Friedrich
        von Hefner-Alteneck. The model clearly concludes "Since 1410 is earlier than
        1904, Johannes Tapissier did NOT die at a later date than Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck.

        that Johannes Tapissier died around 1410 while Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck
        died in 1904, indicating a clear difference in dates (not equality). The model
        explicitly states that "1410 comes before 1904" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of Johannes Tapissier and Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck.

        in 1546, approximately 400 years apart. The model clearly identifies a significant
        difference in the dates rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is confusing because the reasoning suggests Franz Ziereis died
        later (in 1945) than James Butler (in 1546), which would typically lead to
        a "YES" answer if the question was "Did Franz Ziereis die later than James
        Butler?" However, I'm only evaluating what the model explicitly stated as
        its final answer, which is clearly "NO".

        that "Adam de Darlington died earlier than Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff,

        being earlier than the other), not on them being the same.

        response, indicating that Adam de Darlington did not die later than Georg
        Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

        a difference of 541 years. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Constance of Babenberg did not die later than Abraham
        Trembley. The model clearly provides a comparative answer with a definitive
        "NO" conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Constance of Babenberg died in 1243 while Abraham Trembley died in 1784,
        which are different dates. The model explicitly states that "1243 comes before
        1784" and therefore "Constance of Babenberg died at an earlier date than Abraham
        Trembley, not later."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the death dates of Constance of Babenberg and Abraham
        Trembley. The model concludes that "Constance of Babenberg died at an earlier
        date than Abraham Trembley, not later" and provides a clear "NO" as its final
        answer.

        that the dates were different (1243 vs 1784), with Abraham Trembley dying
        later than Constance of Babenberg. The model explicitly states "1784 is later
        than 1243 (by 541 years)" indicating a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Abraham Trembley died
        in 1784 while Constance of Babenberg died in 1243, and concluded that since
        Abraham died later than Constance, the answer to whether Constance died at
        a later date than Abraham is "NO".

        NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on any equality between
        the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Jacques Stella died at a later date than Otto Ernst
        Remer. The model provides dates for both individuals and concludes that Otto
        Ernst Remer died later (in 1997) than Jacques Stella (in 1657).

        that Hugh died in 1126 CE while Ambrosio died in 1373 CE, and explicitly stated
        "Hugh died earlier, not later." The model identified a clear difference in
        dates (1126 vs 1373) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly determined that Hugh did not

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Werner von Eppstein died in 1284 while Urs Graf died around 1528, which
        means Werner died earlier (not later) than Urs by approximately 244 years.
        The model explicitly notes this difference in values as the reason for its
        NO answer.

        period). The model explicitly states the death dates are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Jacques of Botron died later than Paul Weidmann.
        The model concluded that Paul Weidmann died later (in 1801) than Jacques of
        Botron (likely 12th-13th century).

        that the death dates were different (1277 vs 1801), with Paul Weidmann dying
        later than Jacques of Botron. The model explicitly states "Since 1801 is later
        than 1277, Paul Weidmann died at a later date than Jacques of Botron, not
        the other way around."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Jacques of Botron died later than Paul Weidmann.
        The model clearly compares the death dates (1277 vs 1801) and concludes that
        Paul Weidmann died later, not Jacques of Botron.

        vs 1801) and states that "1801 is later than 1277, so Paul Weidmann died at
        a later date than Jacques of Botron." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Jacques of Botron

        in values (1059 vs 1245), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that Eilika died in 1059-1060 while Robert died in 1245, meaning Eilika died
        before Robert, not after him. The model explicitly notes this difference in
        values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Eilika of Schweinfurt died after Robert de Brus,
        4th Lord of Annandale. The model clearly concludes with "Since 1059-1060 is

        concluding that "Since 1059 comes before 1226/1233, Eilika died earlier than

        (1534 CE), which is the opposite of what was apparently being asked (whether
        Asma died later than Rosina).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Asma bint Shihab died
        around 1087 CE while Rosina von Graben von Rain died around 1534 CE, and concluded
        that since 1087 comes before 1534, the answer is "NO".

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the dates are different, with
        Ferdinand Hoefer dying in 1878 and Gerard ter Borch dying in 1681, noting
        they are "almost 200 years" apart. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        died earlier, not later than Hoefer. The model explicitly states "1878 is
        197 years later than 1681" showing the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "ter Borch did
        NOT die at a later date than Hoefer" and ends with "NO" as a definitive answer.

        vs 1878)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that ter Borch died in 1681

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mary of Lusignan died at a later date than Heinrich von Lazan.
        The model clearly concludes that Mary died earlier (in 1322) compared to Heinrich

        not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually corrected its initial
        NO to a YES.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model recognized
        its error and provided a clear final answer of "YES" at the end of its response.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in
        the death dates (1322 vs 1329) and stated that "Mary died earlier than Heinrich."
        The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of Mary of Lusignan and Heinrich von Lazan.
        The model determined that Mary died in 1322 while Heinrich died in 1329, and
        concluded that Mary died earlier than Heinrich, leading to the "NO" answer.

        being compared are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Joachim died
        approximately 312 years before Alonso," indicating a clear difference in the
        dates of death. The model's NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison at all due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer begins with "NO" but is immediately
        qualified with "I cannot confirm..." This indicates the model is stating it
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about one of the subjects
        (Joaquim de Siena). This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        are different (1644 vs 1990) and that one is earlier than the other ("1990
        is later than 1644 by about 346 years"). The NO answer was given because Kim
        Ja-jeom died earlier, not because the dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that Kim Ja-jeom died in 1644 and Jimmy Van Heusen died in
        1990, concluding that "Kim Ja-jeom did NOT die at a later date than Jimmy

        Ja-jeom died in 1657 while Jimmy Van Heusen died in 1990, with a difference
        of 333 years). The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Kim died before
        Van Heusen, not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of Kim Ja-jeom (1657) and Jimmy Van Heusen
        (1990). The model directly answers the comparative question with an explicit
