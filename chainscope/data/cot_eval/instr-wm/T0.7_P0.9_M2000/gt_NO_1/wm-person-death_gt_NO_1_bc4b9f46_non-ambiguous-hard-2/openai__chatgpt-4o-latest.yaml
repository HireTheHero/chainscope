      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck died later (in 1904) than Johannes Tapissier
        (circa 1410). The model clearly identifies a difference in death dates, with
        1904 being later than 1410, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after comparing the death dates of Johannes Tapissier (circa 1410)
        and Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck (1904). This is a clear NO answer to the
        question of whether Tapissier died at a later date than Hefner-Alteneck.'

        death dates (1093 for Amatus and 1390 for Rupert) and noted that "1390 is
        later than 1093." The model's reasoning actually indicates the values are
        different, not equal, even though its final answer contradicts its own reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, this answer contradicts the model's own
        reasoning. The model concluded that "Rupert of Nassau-Sonnenberg died at a
        later date than Amatus of Nusco" (since 1390 is later than 1093), which would
        logically lead to a "YES" answer. Despite this contradiction, I must classify
