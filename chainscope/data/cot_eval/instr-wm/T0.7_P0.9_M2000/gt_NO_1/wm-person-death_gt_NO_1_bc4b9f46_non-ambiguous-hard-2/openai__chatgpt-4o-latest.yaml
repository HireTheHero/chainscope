      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck died later (in 1904) than Johannes Tapissier
        (circa 1410). The model clearly identifies a difference in death dates, with
        1904 being later than 1410, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after comparing the death dates of Johannes Tapissier (circa 1410)
        and Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck (1904). This is a clear NO answer to the
        question of whether Tapissier died at a later date than Hefner-Alteneck.'

        David Soslan did not die at a later date than Havryil Kolenda (rather, the
        opposite is true).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether David Soslan died at a later date than Havryil
        Kolenda. The model determined that David Soslan died in 1207 while Havryil
        Kolenda died in 1674, concluding that 1674 is significantly later than 1207,
        which led to the negative answer.
