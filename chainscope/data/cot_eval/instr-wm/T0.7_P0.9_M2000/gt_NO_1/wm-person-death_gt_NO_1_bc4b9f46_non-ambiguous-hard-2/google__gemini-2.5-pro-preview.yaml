      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Tapissier died in 1410 which is much earlier than Hefner-Alteneck's death
        in 1904. The model explicitly states "1410 is much earlier than 1904" and
        concludes that "Tapissier did not die later" than Hefner-Alteneck.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Tapissier died in 1410
        which is earlier than Hefner-Alteneck who died in 1904, and therefore concluded
        that Tapissier did not die later than Hefner-Alteneck.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different (1409
        vs 1904) and that "Tapissier died earlier, not later" than Hefner-Alteneck.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Tapissier died later than Hefner-Alteneck. The
        model provides a direct comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "1410 is significantly
        earlier than 1904" and concludes that "Tapissier did not die later" because
        his death date was earlier. The model is noting a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Tapissier died later than Hefner-Alteneck. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Beatrice died in 1384 while Antoine died in 1728, and since 1384 is earlier
        than 1728, Beatrice did not die later than Antoine. The model did not state
        that the values being compared are the same or equal - it explicitly noted
        that the dates are different (1384 vs 1728) and that one is earlier than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Beatrice (died 1384)
        did not die later than Antoine (died 1728) because 1384 is earlier than 1728.

        Antoine died in 1728, and concludes that "1384 comes much earlier than 1728."
        The model's reason for the NO answer is that Beatrice died much earlier than
        Antoine, not that they died on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is bolded at the end of the response. It directly answers the comparative
        question of whether Beatrice Regina della Scala died at a later date than
        Antoine Desgodetz with a definitive "NO, she died much earlier."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (death dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Constance died
        in the late 12th century while Abraham Trembley died in 1784 (late 18th century),
        and concludes that "1784 is a much later date than any date in the late 12th
        century." The model is clearly indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Constance of
        Babenberg died earlier than Abraham Trembley, and provides "NO" as its definitive
        answer.

        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Constance died "much earlier" than Abraham (1160s vs 1784), indicating a clear
        difference in the dates rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        later than Marianus III." The model is comparing different dates, not equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Conrad died later than Marianus III. The model
        determined that Conrad died in 1157 while Marianus III died in 1321, and since
        1157 comes before 1321, it concluded with a definitive "NO" answer.

        1125 while Lorenzo Salimbeni died around 1420, and concluded that since 1125
        is earlier than 1420, Berengar I did not die at a later date than Lorenzo
        Salimbeni.

        not that the dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that John V died in 1507
        while Christoph Christian von Dabelow died in 1830, and concluded that since
        1507 is earlier than 1830, John V did not die later.

        that Bidermann died in 1639 which is earlier than Morandell's death in 1810.
        The model explicitly states "1639 is *earlier* than 1810" as the reason for
        its NO answer, indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model determined that Jacob Bidermann died
        in 1639 while Peter Paul Morandell died in 1810, and concluded that since

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Voigt died in 1821 which is earlier than Selten who died in 2016. The
        model explicitly states "Voigt died earlier than Selten" as the reason for
        its NO answer, not because the death dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of Johann Karl Wilhelm Voigt (1821) and Reinhard
        Selten (2016). The model explicitly concludes that "Voigt died earlier than
        Selten" and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether Voigt died later
        than Selten.

        in 1821 while Reinhard Selten died in 2016, and concludes that Voigt "died
        much earlier." The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also says "No, he died much earlier" in step 7 of its reasoning.
        The model is clearly providing a negative answer to the comparative question.
