      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the death
        dates are different, with Hefner-Alteneck dying in 1904 and Tapissier dying

        are equal. Instead, it clearly states that Tapissier died in 1410 and Hefner-Alteneck
        died in 1904, and the NO answer is because 1410 comes before 1904, not because
        the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        died at different times - Tapissier around 1410-1420 and von Hefner-Alteneck
        in 1904. The model's NO answer was based on the fact that von Hefner-Alteneck
        died later than Tapissier, not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the dates of death are different, with Hefner-Alteneck dying later (1904)
        than Tapissier (1410-1420). The model explicitly states this difference in
        timing as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Johannes Tapissier did not die at a later date than Friedrich
        von Hefner-Alteneck. The model explains that Tapissier died around 1410-1420
        while Hefner-Alteneck died in 1904, and concludes that "Hefner-Alteneck died
        at a later date than Tapissier, not the other way around."

        a clear difference between the dates. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Johannes Tapissier die at a later date than Friedrich
        von Hefner-Alteneck?" The model provides a direct comparative result, explaining
        that since 1410 is earlier than 1904, Johannes Tapissier did NOT die at a
        later date than Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck.

        that David Soslan died earlier (1207 CE) than Havryil Kolenda (1674 CE), which
        is the opposite of what was being asked. The model explicitly states that
        David Soslan died "approximately 467 years EARLIER than Havryil Kolenda, not
        later." This indicates a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that David Soslan did not die later than Havryil Kolenda.
        The model clearly explains that David Soslan died in 1207 CE while Havryil
        Kolenda died in 1674 CE, and since 1207 comes before 1674, David Soslan died

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Marie de Coucy died in 1284
        while Giovanni Battista Bassani died in 1716, and concludes that Marie de
        Coucy died approximately 432 years before Bassani, not after him. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the death dates of Marie de Coucy and Giovanni Battista
        Bassani. The model concludes that Marie de Coucy died earlier than Bassani,
        which leads to its "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Jan Sokol z Lamberka died in 1410 while Hans Jeschonnek died in 1943, and
        since 1410 is earlier than 1943, Sokol did not die at a later date than Jeschonnek.
        The model is not claiming the values are equal or the same - it's explicitly
        stating they are different (1410 vs 1943).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Jan Sokol z Lamberka die at a later date than Hans Jeschonnek?"
        The model clearly concludes that since Jan Sokol z Lamberka died in 1410 and

        earlier than 1943 by more than five centuries," indicating a clear difference
        in the dates. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that one date is

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the death dates were different (1744 vs 1938), with Edmond van Saanen
        Algi dying later than Franz Kasimir von Kleist. The model explicitly states
        "Since 1938 is later than 1744, Edmond van Saanen Algi died at a later date
        than Franz Kasimir von Kleist."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. The model concludes that Edmond van Saanen Algi
        died later than Franz Kasimir von Kleist, and therefore answers "NO" to the

        died in circa 1320 while von Knobelsdorff died in 1753, meaning Adam de Darlington
        died earlier, not later. The model identified a clear difference in values
        (1320 vs 1753).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the death dates and concluding that Adam de Darlington
        died earlier than von Knobelsdorff, not later.

        died in 1784, with Constance dying "approximately 541 years before Trembley."
        The NO answer is based on the fact that Constance died earlier, not that they
        died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Constance of Babenberg

        in 1243 which is earlier than Trembley's death in 1784 (approximately 541
        years before). The model identified a clear difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        dying approximately 541 years BEFORE Abraham Trembley. The model's NO answer
        is based on the fact that the death dates are different and in the opposite
        order of what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the death dates of Constance of Babenberg and Abraham
        Trembley. The model concludes that "Constance of Babenberg died approximately

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Constance of Babenberg die at a later date than Abraham
        Trembley?" The model clearly indicates that Constance died in 1243 which is

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the question. Instead, it explicitly states "I cannot provide a
        definitive YES or NO answer to this question" because it lacks information
        about Wolfgang Glaeser's death date. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient

        the values are equal. The model explicitly states "1332 is approximately 300
        years before 1633" and concludes she died earlier, not at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Marie of Valois died at a later date than Johannes
        Crellius. The model clearly concludes "Since Marie of Valois died in 1332,
        which is earlier than Johannes Crellius who died in 1633, she did NOT die
        at a later date than him. NO"

        earlier than Marianus III (1157 comes before 1321), indicating a clear difference
        in values. The model states "Conrad died earlier than Marianus III, not later"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the death dates of Conrad (1157) and Marianus III

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Jean de La Grange died in 1402
        while Heinrich Theobald Schenck died in 1727, with approximately 325 years
        difference between them. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "Therefore, Jean de La Grange did NOT die at a later

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Jean de La Grange died earlier (in 1402) than Heinrich Theobald Schenck
        (in 1727), not because their death dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the death dates of Jean de La Grange (1402) and Heinrich Theobald
        Schenck (1727). The model explicitly concludes that "Jean de La Grange died

        in 1450 and Cornelis Geelvinck died in 1689, with Ludwig dying 239 years before
        Cornelis. The model clearly identifies a difference in values (death dates)
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        times - Ludwig I in 1450 and Cornelis Geelvinck in 1689. The model's NO answer
        is based on the fact that Ludwig I died first (earlier), not that they died
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        died in 1733, and that "Ludwig died approximately 283 years before Cornelis."
        The model gives a clear NO because one date is earlier than the other, not
        because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that "Ludwig did NOT die at a later date than

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly states that Hugh VI died in 1151 while Filippo
        Maria Visconti died in 1447, and explicitly notes that 1151 is earlier than
        1447 "by nearly 300 years." The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Hugh VI of Lusignan did NOT die at a later date

        while Lorenzo Salimbeni died around 1420 CE, with Berengar dying "approximately
        295 years earlier than Lorenzo Salimbeni." The model is giving NO as an answer
        because one date is earlier than the other, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Berengar I did NOT die at a later date than Lorenzo
        Salimbeni. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        971 CE while Costanzo Festa died in 1545 CE, and concludes that "Muhammad
        al-Khushani died approximately 574 years EARLIER than Costanzo Festa, not
        later." The NO answer is based on the fact that one date is earlier than the
        other, not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. It clearly answers the question "Did Muhammad al-Khushani die at
        a later date than Costanzo Festa?" with a definitive "NO" after comparing
        the death dates of both historical figures.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that al-Khushani
        died approximately 574 years BEFORE Festa, indicating a clear difference in
        values. The model's reasoning is that 971 CE comes before 1545 CE on the timeline,
        not that the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        equal. The model specifically states "Muhammad al-Khushani died approximately
        574 years BEFORE Costanzo Festa" and compares the dates (971 CE vs 1545 CE),
        showing they are different values.

        around 1545 CE. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that al-Khushani
        died at an earlier date, not that they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Muhammad al-Khushani die at a later date than Costanzo
        Festa?" The model clearly concludes that Muhammad al-Khushani did not die

        between the death dates. The model's reason for saying NO is that Muhammad
        al-Khushani died earlier, not at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        making Bernard II's death approximately 330 years earlier than David Lyndsay's.
        The model is not saying the values are equal but rather that they are different,
        with Bernard II dying earlier, not later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of Bernard II and David Lyndsay. The model
        concludes that Bernard II died earlier than David Lyndsay, not later.

        meaning Caterina died later (not Waleran). The model explicitly states "Caterina
        Martinelli died at a later date than Waleran de Beaumont, not the other way
        around." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Jeanne d'Albret died in 1572 while Verena Holmes died in 1964, which
        means Jeanne d'Albret died earlier, not later. The model explicitly states
        "Jeanne d'Albret did NOT die at a later date" because 1572 comes before 1964,
        not because the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Jeanne d'Albret died at a later date than Verena
        Holmes. The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining that Jeanne
        d'Albret died in 1572 while Verena Holmes died in 1964.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer to
        this question" because it lacks information about Joaquim de Siena's death
        date. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot

        based on one date being earlier than the other, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Joaquim de Siena died at a later date than Alonso
        de Ribera. The model clearly concludes with "NO" after comparing the death
        dates.

        1150 while Guillaume de Harsigny died around 1393, with about 243 years difference
        between them. The NO answer is based on the fact that Roger died earlier,
        not that they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        that Guillaume de Harsigny died later (circa 1393 CE) than Roger I Trencavel
        (circa 1150 CE), which contradicts the premise of the question asking if Roger
        I Trencavel died at a later date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the death dates of Roger I Trencavel and Guillaume
        de Harsigny. The model concludes that "Guillaume de Harsigny died at a later
        date than Roger I Trencavel, not the other way around" and then gives a clear

        around 1393 CE, meaning Guillaume died later than Roger (not the other way

        Jimmy Van Heusen died in 1990, and that "1651 is earlier than 1990 by 339
        years." The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also says "Kim Ja-jeom did NOT die at a later date than Jimmy
        Van Heusen." This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "1651 is earlier than 1990"
        and concludes that Kim Ja-jeom died at an earlier date than Jimmy Van Heusen,
        not at a later date. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the death dates of Kim Ja-jeom (1651) and Jimmy Van Heusen
        (1990). This is a direct answer to the comparative question.
