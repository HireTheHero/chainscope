      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the death dates are different
        (1410 vs. 1904) and that "Hefner-Alteneck died much later than Tapissier."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a direct comparative answer to the question
        of whether Tapissier died later than Hefner-Alteneck.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Tapissier died in 1410/1411 while Hefner-Alteneck died in 1904, which
        means Tapissier died before (not later than) Hefner-Alteneck. The model explicitly
        states "Tapissier died before Hefner-Alteneck" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model determined that Johannes Tapissier died before Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck
        (1410/1411 vs. 1904), and therefore concluded "NO" to the question of whether
        Tapissier died later than Hefner-Alteneck.

        death dates are different (c. 1207 vs 1674) and concludes that "David Soslan
        died earlier, not later, than Havryil Kolenda." The NO is based on the fact
        that one date is earlier than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether David Soslan died later than Havryil
        Kolenda. The model clearly concludes "NO" after determining that David Soslan
        died in c. 1207 while Havryil Kolenda died in 1674, meaning David Soslan died
        earlier, not later.

        dates (1207 vs. 1674) and determined that one is earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of David Soslan (1207) and Havryil Kolenda

        Soslan died in 1207 while Havryil Kolenda died in 1964, which are different
        dates. The model explicitly states "David Soslan died earlier, not later"
        as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared (death dates) are
        not equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model determined that David Soslan died earlier (1207) than Havryil Kolenda

        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that 1207
        is earlier than 1674, indicating a clear difference between the two death
        dates. The model's reasoning is based on one date being earlier than the other,
        not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. This is a direct answer to the comparative
        question of whether David Soslan died at a later date than Havryil Kolenda.
        The model explains that 1207 (Soslan's death date) is earlier than 1674 (Kolenda's

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Throughout the response, the model repeatedly states that
        it cannot determine whether Rostislav Mikhailovich died later than Guillaume
        Ragutel de Montfort because it cannot find a death date for Guillaume. The
        model explains that without both death dates, the comparison cannot be made,
        and therefore a definitive YES or NO answer cannot be given. The model rejects
        the premise that the comparison can be made with the available information.

        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        the dates are different, with Jean de La Grange dying in 1402 and Heinrich
        Theobald Schenck likely dying centuries later. The model concludes that La
        Grange died earlier, not later, which is why it answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that Jean de La Grange
        died earlier (in 1402) than Heinrich Theobald Schenck (who likely died centuries
        later), and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether La Grange died
        at a later date than Schenck.

        and that Heinrich Theobald Schenck likely died after 1402, making Jean de
        La Grange's death earlier. The NO answer is based on a temporal difference
        (before/after), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion,
        indicating that Jean de La Grange did not die at a later date than Heinrich
        Theobald Schenck. This is a clear negative comparative answer to the question.

        different (1402 vs 1571) and that one date is earlier than the other. The
        model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Jean de La Grange died before
        (not at the same time as) Heinrich Theobald Schenck.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" as its final answer.
        It determines that Jean de La Grange died in 1402 while Heinrich Theobald
        Schenck died in 1571, and concludes that since 1402 is not later than 1571,
        the answer is "No."

        Hugh VI died in 1110 which is earlier than Filippo Maria Visconti's death
        in 1447. The model did not state that the values are equal or the same - in
        fact, it explicitly stated they are different with "1110 is significantly
        earlier than 1447." The NO answer was based on the chronological difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Hugh VI died at a later date than Filippo Maria
        Visconti. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the death dates are different
        (971 CE vs. 1545 CE) and states that "Muhammad al-Khushani died *earlier*,
        not later" than Costanzo Festa. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of Muhammad al-Khushani (971 CE) and Costanzo
        Festa (1545 CE). The model clearly concludes that Muhammad al-Khushani did
        not die later than Costanzo Festa.

        that Muhammad al-Khushani died in 971 AD, which is earlier than Costanzo Festa
        who died in 1545 AD. The model explicitly states "971 AD is earlier than 1545
        AD" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Muhammad al-Khushani did not die later than Costanzo
        Festa. The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

        dates. The NO answer is based on this difference (with Muhammad al-Khushani
        dying earlier, not later, than Costanzo Festa), not on any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in Step 5 after comparing the death dates of Muhammad al-Khushani (971 AD)
        and Costanzo Festa (1545 AD). This is an explicit NO answer to the question
        of whether Muhammad al-Khushani died at a later date than Costanzo Festa.

        died in 1185 while David Lyndsay died around 1555, and concludes that Bernard
        II died *earlier* than David Lyndsay, not at the same time. The NO answer
        is based on the fact that Bernard II died before (not at the same time as)
        David Lyndsay.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Gerard ter Borch died in 1681
        and Ferdinand Hoefer died in 1878, and concludes that "1878 is later than
        1681" and "Gerard ter Borch died earlier." The NO answer is based on the fact
        that the dates are different, with ter Borch's death being earlier, not the
        same.

        "1393 is later than 1060" and asks "Did 1060 come after 1393? No." This indicates
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of Roger I Trencavel (1060) and Guillaume
        de Harsigny (1393). The model determined that 1060 did not come after 1393,
        and therefore Roger I Trencavel did not die at a later date than Guillaume
        de Harsigny.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Roger I Trencavel died in 1150, which is earlier than Guillaume de Harsigny's
        death in 1393. The model's reasoning is based on a clear difference between
        the dates (1150 vs 1393), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the death dates of Roger I Trencavel (1150) and Guillaume
        de Harsigny (1393). The model explicitly concludes that "Roger I Trencavel
        did *not* die at a later date than Guillaume de Harsigny" and provides "NO"
        as its final answer.

        that "Roger I Trencavel did not die at a later date than Guillaume de Harsigny."
        The NO answer is based on one date being earlier than the other, not on the
        dates being equal.

        that Roger I Trencavel died in 1194 and Guillaume de Harsigny died in 1393,
        and determined that 1194 is before (not after) 1393. The model explicitly
        states "1194 is *before* 1393, not later" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Roger I Trencavel died
        in 1194 while Guillaume de Harsigny died in 1393, and concluded that since
        1194 is before 1393, Roger I Trencavel did not die later than Guillaume de
        Harsigny.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Roger I Trencavel died in 1096
        and Guillaume de Harsigny died in 1393, and concludes that "Roger I Trencavel
        died earlier, not later." The NO answer is based on the fact that the death
        dates are different (1096 vs. 1393), with Roger dying earlier than Guillaume,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is therefore

        the values being compared are the same. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in dates and states "Brian of Brittany died *earlier*, not *later*." The NO
        is based on the comparative relationship being opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        died in 1300 while Brian of Brittany died sometime after 1142 (likely before
        1150). The model concludes "NO" because it determined that Segarelli died
        later than Brian, not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that the statement "Brian of Brittany die at a

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO but was actually expressing inability to make the
        comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, the reasoning provided indicates that the model cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information about Brian of Brittany's
        death date. The model states "we cannot definitively say whether Brian of
        Brittany died at a later date than Gerard Segarelli" and "we cannot definitively
        compare their death dates." This indicates the model is actually saying it
        cannot determine the answer rather than providing a definitive negative comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that John IV died in 1567
        while Sir Joshua Rowley died in 1791, and concluded that since 1567 is earlier
        than 1791, John IV did not die at a later date than Sir Joshua Rowley.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the death dates are different
        (John IV died in 1567 while Sir Joshua Rowley died in 1790) and concludes
        that John IV died earlier, not later. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. It directly answers the comparative
        question with a definitive NO.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that John IV died in 1567 and Sir Joshua Rowley died in 1791, which means
        John IV died earlier (not later) than Sir Joshua Rowley. The model explicitly
        noted a difference in dates (1567 vs 1791).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that John IV died in 1567

        explicitly states "1567 is earlier than 1791" as the reason for its NO answer,
        not because the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether John IV's death date is later than Sir Joshua Rowley's
        death date. The model determined that John IV died in 1567 while Sir Joshua
        Rowley died in 1791, and concluded that 1567 is earlier than 1791, leading

        that 1651 is earlier than (not later than) 1991. The model explicitly states
        "1651 is *not* later than 1991" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Kim Ja-jeom died in
        1651 while Jimmy Van Heusen died in 1991, and concluded that 1651 is not later
        than 1991, so Kim Ja-jeom did not die later than Jimmy Van Heusen.
