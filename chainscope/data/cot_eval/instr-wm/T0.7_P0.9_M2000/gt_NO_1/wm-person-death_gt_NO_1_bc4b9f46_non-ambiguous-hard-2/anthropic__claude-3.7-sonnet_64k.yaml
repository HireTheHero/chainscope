      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies that Tapissier died around 1410
        while Hefner-Alteneck died in 1904, and the NO answer is based on the fact
        that 1410 is earlier than 1904, not that the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        It concludes that "Johannes Tapissier did NOT die at a later date than Friedrich
        von Hefner-Alteneck" and explicitly provides "NO" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Tapissier died around 1410 while
        Hefner-Alteneck died in 1904, and even calculates that "1410 is approximately
        494 years earlier than 1904." The NO answer is based on the fact that Tapissier
        died earlier, not that they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes "Therefore, Johannes Tapissier did NOT die at a later
        date than Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck. NO" at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the dates
        are different, with Johannes Tapissier dying around 1410 and Friedrich von
        Hefner-Alteneck dying in 1904, which is about 494 years later. The model clearly
        indicates a difference in values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.

        Tapissier died around 1410-1420 while Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck died in
        1904, which is nearly 500 years later. The model clearly identifies a difference
        in values (1410-1420 vs 1904) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model explicitly concludes that "Johannes
        Tapissier did not die at a later date than Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck"
        after comparing their death dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        James Butler died in 1546 while Franz Ziereis died in 1945, which means Butler
        died earlier, not later. The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference of approximately
        399 years between their death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the dates of death for both individuals. The model determined
        that James Butler died in 1546 and Franz Ziereis died in 1945, concluding

        in dates, not on equality. The model explicitly states that James Butler died
        in 1546 and Franz Ziereis died in 1945, noting this is "approximately 400
        years before" and concluding that "James Butler died at an earlier date than
        Franz Ziereis, not a later date." The NO is based on this difference in dates,
        not on any equality.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Marie de Coucy died around 1284-1285
        while Giovanni Battista Bassani died in 1716, and concludes that Marie de
        Coucy died approximately 430 years EARLIER than Giovanni Battista Bassani.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.

        later than Francesco, noting "Jakob Ernst died approximately 170-180 years
        later, in the early 18th century." The model gives a clear reason for the

        that Edmond van Saanen Algi likely died after 1808, while Franz Kasimir von
        Kleist died in 1808. The model explicitly states the values are different
        (not equal), with one death occurring in 1808 and the other likely occurring

        in 1808 and Edmond van Saanen Algi died in 1915, and concludes that one died
        earlier than the other. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear "NO" answer at the end
        of its response. After comparing the death dates (1808 for Franz Kasimir von
        Kleist and 1915 for Edmond van Saanen Algi), it concludes "Franz Kasimir von

        the values being compared. The model states "Franz Kasimir von Kleist would
        have died before Edmond van Saanen Algi, not after him."

        times (1808 vs 1967) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The
        NO answer is based on the fact that one person died before the other, not
        because they died at the same time.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Beatrice died in 1384 while Antoine
        died in 1728, with a difference of approximately 344 years. The model's NO
        answer is based on the fact that Beatrice's death date is earlier than Antoine's,
        not that they died on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        end of its response to the question "Did Beatrice Regina della Scala die at
        a later date than Antoine Desgodetz?" The model also states "Beatrice Regina
        della Scala did NOT die at a later date than Antoine Desgodetz" right before
        giving its final answer.

        died at a later date than Beatrice Regina della Scala, not the other way around."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Beatrice Regina della Scala did not die at a later

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer to this question" because it lacks information about Wolfgang
        Glaeser's death date. The model indicates it cannot determine whether Benedict
        Stattler died at a later date than Wolfgang Glaeser without knowing when Glaeser
        died. This is a clear case where the model acknowledges it cannot make the

        that Marie died approximately 301 years BEFORE Johannes Crellius. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Marie of Valois, Duchess of Calabria die at a later date
        than Johannes Crellius?" The model explains that Marie died in 1332 while

        earlier, not later. The model explicitly states the values are different (not
        equal), with a difference of about 301 years. The NO is based on the fact
        that 1332 comes before 1633, not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the death dates of Marie of Valois (1332) and Johannes

        than Guillaume, not later. The model explicitly states the dates are different
        (1262 vs 1740) and concludes "Since 1262 comes before 1740, Rostislav died
        earlier than Guillaume, not later."

        "2012 is approximately 495 years after 1517, so Bill Tarmey died much later
        than Francesco Francia." The NO answer is based on the fact that the comparison
        is directionally incorrect (Francia did not die later than Tarmey), not because
        the dates are the same.

        1853. The model notes "1853 is 467 years after 1386" and concludes that "Eduard
        Duller died nearly five centuries after John of Islay." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did John of Islay die at a later date than Eduard Duller?"
        The model clearly concludes with "NO" after comparing the death dates and

        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        This is a direct answer to the comparative question of whether Widukind of
        Corvey died at a later date than John Montacute. The model explains that Widukind
        died in 973 CE while John Montacute died in 1400 CE, and since 973 comes before
        1400, Widukind died earlier, not later.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly states that Jean de La Grange died in 1402
        while Heinrich Theobald Schenck died after 1600 (likely around 1635). The
        model's NO answer is based on the fact that La Grange died EARLIER than Schenck,
        not that they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. The model concludes that "Jean de La Grange died at an earlier date

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Jean de La Grange died in
        1402 while Heinrich Theobald Schenck likely lived and died in a later historical
        period. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on a temporal difference
        (one person died before the other), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        NO answer is based on this chronological difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the death dates of Jacques of Botron (circa 1277) and Paul
        Weidmann (1801). The model explicitly concludes that Jacques of Botron did

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Eilika died around 1055-1059
        CE while Robert died around 1245 CE, with "approximately 190 years" difference
        between them. The model states that "Eilika of Schweinfurt died significantly
        earlier than Robert de Brus," which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Eilika of Schweinfurt did NOT die at a later date
        than Robert de Brus, 4th Lord of Annandale. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Eilika died around 1055-1059
        while Robert died in 1245, making Eilika's death approximately 190 years BEFORE
        Robert's. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is NO" in its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Robert de
        Brus died approximately 185 years after Eilika of Schweinfurt, indicating
        a clear difference in death dates. The model's reasoning for the NO answer
        is that Eilika died earlier (1059-1060 CE) than Robert (1245 CE), not that
        they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Eilika of Schweinfurt
        did not die at a later date than Robert de Brus, 4th Lord of Annandale" as

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in dates, not on equality. The model explicitly states that Eilika died around
        1060 while Robert died in 1233, making them approximately 173 years apart.
        The model concludes "Eilika died approximately 173 years BEFORE Robert de
        Brus, not later." This is a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that Eilika of Schweinfurt
        died around 1060, which is earlier than Robert de Brus who died in 1233, and
        therefore concluded that Eilika did NOT die at a later date than Robert.

        apart, with Eilika dying in the 11th century (around 1059-1060s) and Robert
        dying in the 13th century (1245). The NO answer is based on Eilika dying earlier,
        not on equal death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Eilika of Schweinfurt did not die at a later date than Robert
        de Brus. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

        that Eilika died earlier (1055-1059) than Robert (1245), with nearly 200 years
        difference between their deaths. The model explicitly states this time difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        different, with Asma dying in 1138 CE and Rosina dying in 1534 CE, which is
        "approximately 396 years later." The model's NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion of its response. The model directly answers the question
        "Did Jacob Bidermann die at a later date than Peter Paul Morandell?" with
        "NO" after comparing their death dates (1639 vs 1744).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the values
        being equal. Instead, the model explicitly stated that Bidermann died EARLIER
        than Morandell (in 1639 vs. 1976), not at the same time. The model specifically
        noted "Jacob Bidermann died approximately 337 years EARLIER than Peter Paul
        Morandell, not later."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that Jacob Bidermann
        died in 1639, which is earlier than Peter Paul Morandell who died in 1976,
        and therefore concluded that Bidermann did not die at a later date than Morandell.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Bidermann died 120 years EARLIER than Morandell,
        indicating a clear difference in values. The model says "NO" because Bidermann
        died before Morandell, not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the death dates of Jacob Bidermann (1639) and Peter Paul Morandell
        (1759). The model provides a definitive comparative answer.

        died in 1572 which is earlier than 1964 when Verena Holmes died. The model
        is noting a clear difference in dates (1572 vs 1964), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Jeanne d'Albret die at a later date than Verena Holmes?"
        The model clearly concludes that Jeanne d'Albret did not die at a later date
        than Verena Holmes because 1572 is earlier than 1964.

        that Jeanne d'Albret died earlier (1572) than Verena Holmes (1964), not later.
        The model explicitly states "Since 1572 comes before 1964, Jeanne d'Albret
        died earlier than Verena Holmes, not later." This indicates a clear difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Jeanne d'Albret die at a later date than Verena Holmes?"

        died in the 9th century (887 CE), showing a significant difference in their
        death dates.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Hilary of Poitiers die at a later date than Abbas Ibn
        Firnas?" The model clearly concludes that Hilary did not die at a later date
        than Abbas Ibn Firnas.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Abbas Ibn Firnas died approximately
        520 years later than Hilary of Poitiers. The model gives a clear reason for
        its NO answer - that the dates are different, with Abbas Ibn Firnas dying
        later (887 CE) than Hilary of Poitiers (367/368 CE).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Hilary of Poitiers died around 367-368 CE while Abbas Ibn Firnas died
        around 887 CE, making Hilary's death about 520 years earlier than Abbas's
        death. The model explicitly states this difference in dates as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Hilary of Poitiers died at a later date than Abbas
        Ibn Firnas. The model clearly concludes that Hilary died earlier, not later
        than Abbas.

        equal; it stated it couldn't determine the dates at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, based on my available
        knowledge, I cannot confirm that Mary of Lusignan died at a later date than
        Heinrich von Lazan." This is a case where the model is saying it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        states that Heinrich died in 1329 while Mary died in 1251-1253, which is approximately
        76-78 years earlier. The model's reasoning is that Mary died before Heinrich,
        not that they died at the same time.

        was alive until at least 1418, indicating a clear difference in death dates
        (approximately 160+ years apart). The model notes this significant time difference
        as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Mary of Lusignan, Countess

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Johann Karl
        Wilhelm Voigt died in 1821 while Reinhard Selten died in 2016, and concludes
        that Voigt died earlier (not at the same time). The model states "1821 comes
        before 2016 on the timeline" and "Johann Karl Wilhelm Voigt (d. 1821) died
        earlier than Reinhard Selten (d. 2016)," clearly indicating a difference in
        values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question with a definitive "NO" after analyzing the death dates of both individuals.

        different - John IV died in 1548 while Sir Joshua Rowley died in 1790, with
        a difference of 242 years. The NO answer is because John IV died earlier than
        Sir Joshua Rowley, not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion of its step-by-step reasoning. The model explicitly states
        "John IV did NOT die at a later date than Sir Joshua Rowley" and ends with
        a clear "NO" as the final answer.

        are different (1398 vs 1790) and concludes that "John IV died earlier than
        Sir Joshua Rowley, not later." The model is saying NO because one date comes
        before the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that John IV did not die at a later date than Sir Joshua
        Rowley because John IV died in 1398 while Sir Joshua Rowley died in 1790,
