      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Yunnan is vastly larger than
        Liuyang" and "Yunnan's area is about 179 times larger than Liuyang's area."
        The NO answer is based on this significant difference in size, not on equality
        of values.

        of its response, clearly indicating that Liuyang does NOT have a larger area

        In fact, it explicitly states that Yunnan (394,000 sq km) is significantly
