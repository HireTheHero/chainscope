      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Alabama is located east of Texas" and "Alabama
        is south of Texas, Selma University would also be south of Whitacre College
        of Engineering." The model is claiming a directional difference (south vs.
        north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model also
        states "Selma University is NOT located north of Whitacre College of Engineering"
        in its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Huntington University
        is located SOUTH of Lake Michigan College, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Huntington University
        is SOUTH of Lake Michigan College, indicating a directional difference. The
        reason for the NO answer is that Huntington University is in Indiana (south)
        while Lake Michigan College is in Michigan (north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Huntington University, IN located north of Lake Michigan
        College, MI?" The model provides a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Huntington University
        is SOUTH of Lake Michigan College, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in step 5 of its reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end. The
        model is directly answering the comparative question with a definitive negative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Huntington University (IN) is located south
        of Lake Michigan College (MI)." This indicates a difference in location (south
        vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response after the step-by-step reasoning.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Huntington University
        is SOUTH of Lake Michigan College (not equal to it). The model says NO because
        Huntington University is in Indiana which is south of Michigan where Lake
        Michigan College is located, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Huntington University, IN located north of Lake Michigan
        College, MI?" The model provides a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" answer.
