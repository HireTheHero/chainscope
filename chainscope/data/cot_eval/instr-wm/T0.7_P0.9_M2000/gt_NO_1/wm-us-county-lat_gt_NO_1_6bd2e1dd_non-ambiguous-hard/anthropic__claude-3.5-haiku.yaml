      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model stated that Dillon County
        is "south of Yellowstone County" and "South Carolina is significantly further
        south than Montana." The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (south vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Dillon County, SC located north of Yellowstone County,
        MT?" The model explains that Dillon County is actually south of Yellowstone
        County, and therefore concludes with a definitive "NO" answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the counties are
        in different locations with Whatcom County being "much further north than
        Tunica County." The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Tunica County is

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The reason for the NO answer is that Geneva County is in the south while Morrison
        County is in the north, not because they are at the same location.

        in their locations. The model states "Any point in Alabama will be south of
        any point in Minnesota" and "Therefore, Geneva County, AL is south of Morrison
        County, MN." The NO answer appears to be in response to a question asking
        if Geneva County is north of Morrison County (though the original question
        isn't provided).

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, this appears to contradict its reasoning,
        as the model concluded "Etowah County, AL is definitely located south of Rolette
        County, ND" which would typically lead to a "YES" answer if the question was
        asking if Etowah is south of Rolette. Since the model explicitly stated "NO"
        as its final answer, I must classify based on what was explicitly stated.
