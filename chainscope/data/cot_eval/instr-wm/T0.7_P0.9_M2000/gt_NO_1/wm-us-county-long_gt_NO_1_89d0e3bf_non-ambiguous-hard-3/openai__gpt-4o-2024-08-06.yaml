        indicates a clear difference in the geographic positions, not equality. The
        NO answer was not given because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"

        The NO answer appears to be in response to the original question about whether
        one location is east of the other (though we don't see the original question),
        not because the locations are the same.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO. Reynolds County, MO is not located east of Wicomico County,
        MD." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Reynolds County, MO is located
        west of Wicomico County, MD" and that "Missouri is generally west of Maryland."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the question

        Wicomico County, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model states "Missouri is west of Maryland" and therefore Reynolds County
        would be west of Wicomico County. This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Reynolds County,
        MO is not located east of Wicomico County, MD" as its final answer. This is

        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO. Reynolds County, MO is not located east of Wicomico County,
