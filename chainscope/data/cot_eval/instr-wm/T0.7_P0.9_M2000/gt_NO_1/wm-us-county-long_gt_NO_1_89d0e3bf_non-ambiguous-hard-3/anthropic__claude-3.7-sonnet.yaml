      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bannock County must
        be west of Palo Alto County (not east), indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The model's reasoning is based on the different geographic
        positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the comparative question
        with a definitive "NO" after working through its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Bannock County is west of Palo Alto County (not east). The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Bannock County is east of Palo Alto County. The model explains
        its reasoning step by step and concludes with "Since Bannock County is west
        of Palo Alto County (not east), the answer is: NO"'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Yellowstone County is west of Luce County, not east of it. The model
        explicitly states "Montana is significantly west of Michigan" and concludes
        "Yellowstone County, MT is west of Luce County, MI (not east of it)." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Yellowstone
        County is not east of Luce County, but rather west of it.

        states that "Montana is significantly west of Michigan" and concludes that
        "Yellowstone County (in Montana) must be west of Luce County (in Michigan)."
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Yellowstone County is east of Luce County. The
        model determined that Yellowstone County (in Montana) is west of Luce County
        (in Michigan), not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Duchesne County
        is west of Gentry County" and therefore "cannot be east of it." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Duchesne County is not east of Gentry County. This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Dimmit County is west of Hardee County, not east. The model explicitly
        states "Dimmit County must be west of Hardee County, not east" and "Dimmit
        County, TX is NOT located east of Hardee County, FL. It is located west of
        Hardee County, FL." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which directly answers the implied question of whether Dimmit County, TX is
        located east of Hardee County, FL. The model explicitly concludes "Therefore,
        Dimmit County, TX is NOT located east of Hardee County, FL. It is located
        west of Hardee County, FL." followed by "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Dimmit County cannot be east
        of Hardee County because Dimmit County is in Texas which is west of Florida
        where Hardee County is located. The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Reynolds County is west
        of Wicomico County, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model explicitly says "Reynolds County is NOT east of Wicomico County
        - it's west of it," showing the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model determined that Reynolds County is west of Wicomico County, not east
        of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Wicomico County, MD is east
        of Reynolds County, MO (not the other way around), indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Reynolds County, MO is not located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Reynolds County is west of
        Wicomico County because Missouri is "significantly west of Maryland." The
        model is indicating a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model also
        states "Reynolds County, MO is NOT located east of Wicomico County, MD" which
        reinforces this NO answer.
