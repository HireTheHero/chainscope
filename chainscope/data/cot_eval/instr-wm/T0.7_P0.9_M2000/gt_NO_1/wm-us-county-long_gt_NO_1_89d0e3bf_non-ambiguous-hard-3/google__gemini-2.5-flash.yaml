      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lane County, OR located east of Haakon County, SD?" The
        model provides a direct comparative answer after analyzing the longitudes
        of both locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lane County, OR
        is located west of Haakon County, SD" and that "Oregon is significantly to
        the west of South Dakota." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        directly answering whether Lane County, OR is located east of Haakon County,
        SD. The model concludes that Lane County is west of Haakon County, not east.
