      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that Leavenworth County, KS (longitude approximately
        -94.9) is west of Charles County, MD (longitude approximately -77.0). The
        model gives a NO answer because the locations have different longitudes, with
        Leavenworth being west of Charles County, not east.

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude, stating "The longitude
        of Charles County, MD (around 76 degrees West) is much further east than that
        of Leavenworth County, KS (around 95 degrees West)." The model's NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the

        degrees). The model concludes NO because Asotin County is west of Oliver County,
        not because they are at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that Cache County, UT has a longitude of approximately
        111 degrees west, while Sac County, IA has a longitude of approximately 95
        degrees west. The model concludes that Cache County is west of Sac County,
        not east, which is why it answers NO.

        Instead, it explicitly notes that Mississippi County, AR is west of Perquimans
        County, NC, with different longitudes (approximately 90 degrees west vs. 76
        degrees west). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

        is significantly more negative (indicating it is further west) than that of
        Barren County." The model is giving NO as an answer because it found a difference
        in values (Hansford County is west of Barren County, not east).

        eastern part" and "Hansford County, TX is not located east of Barren County,
        KY" because "Texas is generally west of Kentucky." The model is indicating
        a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Livingston County, MI is
        west of Bristol County, MA (indicating a directional difference), and this
        is the reason for its NO answer. The model is saying NO because the premise
        of the question (that Livingston County is east of Bristol County) is incorrect,
        not because they are at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning indicates that Bristol
        County, MA is east of Livingston County, MI (stating "Massachusetts is located
        to the east of Michigan" and "Bristol County is also east of Livingston County").
        The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does
        not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model provides a step-by-step analysis of

        generally east of Michigan (where Livingston County is)" as the reason for
        its NO answer.

        degrees west) and concludes that Bristol County is east of Livingston County,
        which is why Livingston County cannot be east of Bristol County.

        County cannot be east of Alger County" because of their relative positions,
        not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Michigan, meaning that any part of Montana, including Treasure County, will
        be to the west of any part of Michigan, including Alger County"). The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Spokane County,
        WA is not located east of Roseau County, MN; it is actually to the west."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Spokane County, WA
        is east of Roseau County, MN. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, indicating that Spokane County, WA is not east

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Winneshiek County is located
        to the west of Steuben County due to the overall positioning of Iowa relative
        to New York. The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs.
        east), not on equality of positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Sanpete County is to the west of Bates County, not east. The model states
        "Since Missouri (and Bates County) is located to the east of Utah (and Sanpete
        County), it logically follows that Sanpete County is to the west of Bates
        County." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        is **NO**" as its final conclusion to whether Sanpete County, UT is located
        east of Bates County, MO.

        is positioned to the west of Bates County" and "Missouri is generally to the
        east of Utah." The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Sanpete County, UT is located east of Bates County, MO. This is
        a direct comparative answer to the question posed.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lane County is in Oregon
        on the west coast while Haakon County is in South Dakota in the central region,
        and concludes that "Lane County cannot be east of Haakon County" because "Oregon
        is to the west and South Dakota is to the east of it." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on the above reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
