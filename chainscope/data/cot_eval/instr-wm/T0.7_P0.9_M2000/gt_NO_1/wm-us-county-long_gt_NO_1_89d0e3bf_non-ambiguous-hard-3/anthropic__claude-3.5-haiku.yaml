      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Wabaunsee County is west of Culpeper County, not east. The model explicitly
        states "Kansas is west of Virginia" and "Wabaunsee County is west of Culpeper
        County," indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Wabaunsee County, KS located east of Culpeper County,
        VA?" The model provides reasoning that Wabaunsee County is west of Culpeper
        County, and therefore concludes with a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lane County is
        west of Haakon County" and therefore "Lane County is NOT east of Haakon County."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Lane County is NOT east of Haakon County.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lane County is
        actually west of Haakon County" as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparative
        question of whether Lane County is east of Haakon County.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Lane County is west of Haakon County" and "This
        means Lane County is west of, not east of, Haakon County." The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lane County, OR located east of Haakon County, SD?" The
        model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the answer to ''Is Lane County,
        OR located east of Haakon County, SD?'' is: NO"'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lane County is
        west of Haakon County" and "Lane County is further west than Haakon County,"
        indicating a directional difference between their locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Lane County is NOT east of Haakon County.
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
