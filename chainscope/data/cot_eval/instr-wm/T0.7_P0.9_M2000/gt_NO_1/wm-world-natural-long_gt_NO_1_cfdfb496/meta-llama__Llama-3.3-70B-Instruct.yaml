      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Caha Mountains are to
        the west of the Lakes of Killarney, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, with no caveats or uncertainty about
        its ability to make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, indicating that the Caha Mountains are
        west (not east) of the Lakes of Killarney.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that the Caha Mountains are not east but
        rather west of the Lakes of Killarney.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, describing
        the Caha Mountains as being "southwest" of the Lakes of Killarney. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear comparative answer about
        the relative positions.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that the Caha Mountains are west of
        the Lakes of Killarney, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is because they have different positions relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        when evaluating whether the Caha Mountains are east of the Lakes of Killarney.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Caha Mountains are to the west of the Lakes of Killarney, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations. The answer is definitive and based

    93eb0bb6-1a04-43c5-8d4c-c71f195119be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Caha Mountains are "generally west of the Lakes of Killarney, rather
        than east" - indicating a difference in location as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result about the geographical relationship between the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that the Caha Mountains are "in a more westerly direction" relative
        to the Lakes of Killarney. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the Caha Mountains are located east of the Lakes of
        Killarney. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Caha Mountains
        are southwest of the Lakes of Killarney, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on the Caha Mountains being west (not
        east) of the Lakes of Killarney.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        The answer directly addresses the comparative question about whether the Caha
        Mountains are east of the Lakes of Killarney.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sierra Blanca is west of Loch
        Goil, indicating a difference in position, and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (with Sierra Blanca being west of Loch Goil), not
        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, determining
        that Sierra Blanca is west (not east) of Loch Goil.'

    6623f895-796e-497f-a37e-7cfd35cb18ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because Sierra Blanca
        is southeast of Loch Goil, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly noted a difference in positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, stating that Sierra Blanca
        is southeast (not directly east) of Loch Goil.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Sierra
        Blanca is west of Loch Goil, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Sierra Blanca is not
        east but west of Loch Goil")
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a comparative directional result (indicating Sierra Blanca is

    7a036e32-2120-4b09-ba54-6df82ce72dc7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Sierra Blanca being
        west of Loch Goil, not because the locations are at equal positions. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Spain (and thus Sierra
        Blanca) is west of the UK (and thus Loch Goil)").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - instead, it explicitly states that Sierra Blanca is west of
        Loch Goil. The model determines this through analyzing their relative positions,
        concluding that Spain (where Sierra Blanca is) is southwest of the UK (where
        Loch Goil is).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that "Sierra Blanca
        is not located east of Loch Goil."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Sierra
        Blanca was determined to be west of Loch Goil, indicating a difference in
        position. The model explicitly states "Spain, where Sierra Blanca is located,
        is generally west of the UK, where Loch Goil is located."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Sierra
        Blanca is southwest of Loch Goil, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude. It explicitly states a directional difference ("southwest") rather
        than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, determining

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Great Salt Plains Lake is "west of central Texas" and "not east of Lake Travis."
        The NO is based on a directional difference (being west rather than east),
        not because the locations are at the same longitude. The model never states
        the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - it explicitly states Great Salt Plains Lake is "more to the west" than Lake
        Travis, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Great Salt Plains Lake is west of Lake
        Travis ("Northwestern Oklahoma is generally west of central Texas"). The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

    7ccefc0f-c122-440b-94f3-a4e91941c8bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Great Salt
        Plains Lake is "west and slightly north of Lake Travis" - indicating a difference
        in position was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

    89fc04a0-7a79-4ff3-abc0-84d93f205448:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Great Salt
        Plains Lake is west of Lake Travis, indicating a difference in location. The
        NO answer was given because the relationship was opposite to what was asked
        (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        that Great Salt Plains Lake is west of Lake Travis, not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it says "it's reasonable to deduce that Great Salt Plains Lake would
        be slightly west or at a similar longitude to Lake Travis" and concludes NO
        because it's "more likely to be at a similar longitude or slightly west."
        The mention of possible similar longitude is not given as the primary reason
        for the NO answer, and the model includes the possibility of being "slightly
        west."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a direct comparative answer to whether Great Salt Plains

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Great Salt Plains Lake
        is "more to the north and slightly west of Lake Travis." This difference in
        position, even though described as "slightly west," means the NO answer was
        not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions of the two lakes. The answer is
        clear and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because
        it determined Great Salt Plains Lake is west of Lake Travis, indicating a
        difference in position. The model specifically mentions "Great Salt Plains
        Lake is likely west of Lake Travis."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Great Salt Plains Lake is east of Lake Travis. The
        model provides reasoning and arrives at a definitive comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (Wallowa Lake is west of Mount Athabasca), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Wallowa Lake
        is west (not east) of Mount Athabasca.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Wallowa Lake was determined to be southwest of Mount Athabasca, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the geographical positions, determining that
        Wallowa Lake is southwest of Mount Athabasca, not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal. While it mentions they might be "roughly at the same longitude,"
        it actually suggests Wallowa Lake is "slightly to the east" of parts of Alberta.
        The NO answer is based on other geographical reasoning about their positions,

        of comparing "east" across hemispheres. The model actually emphasizes their
        different locations (Antarctica vs. North America) as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. While it discusses complications with
        the comparison across hemispheres, it still commits to a definitive NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are in the
        same location or have equal positions. Instead, it notes they are both in
        the northern part of Brampton but suggests different relative positions (Heart
        Lake being "west or northwest of the city center" while Professor's Lake is
        "more north"). The NO answer appears to be based on geographical analysis
        rather than equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the lakes
        being at equal positions. Instead, it suggests that Heart Lake is "not significantly
        east" and might be "slightly more to the west" of Professor's Lake. The model's
        uncertainty and mention of potential differences, even if slight, means this
        is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

        is a directional difference, with Heart Lake being "generally west of the
        city center" and Professor's Lake being "more towards the east side of Brampton."
        This difference in position is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative statement that Heart Lake is positioned more to the
        west relative to Professor's Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model gave NO because it
        determined Tilyar Lake is northeast of Paravur Lake rather than directly east,
        indicating a specific directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its directional analysis. The
        model is confident in this answer and provides specific reasoning for why
        one location is not east of the other (stating it's more northeast rather
        than directly east).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal. It explicitly states
        "Lac Courte Oreilles would be west of Lake Wissota, not east" indicating a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that "Lac
        Courte Oreilles, being in the northwest, is generally west or northwest of
        Lake Wissota" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot verify the location of
        Lago di Saoseo and therefore cannot make the comparison, but gives a "NO"
        answer due to lack of confirmatory evidence. Since the NO is given because
        it cannot determine/verify the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions due to insufficient information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually gives "NO" as its final
        answer, the reasoning indicates it "cannot accurately determine" and there
        is "insufficient information." The model explicitly states it cannot make
        a definitive comparison due to lack of information about one location. This
        makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

    771b9c1a-3725-48eb-a178-60cbaf5da8b0:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had considered the final "NO" as the answer, the model never stated the
        locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as its final answer,
        the reasoning clearly indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to insufficient information about Lago di Saoseo's location. The model
        explicitly states "we cannot definitively determine if Lake Iseo is east of
        Lago di Saoseo." This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

    9395430c-2004-4226-82b2-eefcea489faa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions, suggesting Lake Iseo would be more north than east
        of the comparison point. The uncertainty about the exact location of Lago
        di Saoseo doesn't change that the model's NO is based on directional differences
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, even though it expresses uncertainty about one of the locations.
        The NO appears to be a definitive comparative answer rather than an inability
        to determine.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,

        Saoseo.

    ed6401fe-c48e-4153-a400-1f3ae077e69e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/identical. Rather, it gives the NO answer based on comparing Lake
        Iseo's position relative to other known lakes in the region, suggesting directional
        differences. The uncertainty about one location's existence does not constitute
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model expresses uncertainty about one of
        the locations and notes the question's premise is flawed, it ultimately provides
        an explicit "NO" answer at the end, even if described as "speculative". The
        model gives a clear directional answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it actually couldn't verify
        one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its response, it
        immediately qualifies this by saying it's based on assumptions and acknowledging
        that "Lago di Saoseo" cannot be verified as a real location. The model essentially
        rejects the premise of the question since one of the locations doesn't appear
        to exist, making this an UNKNOWN classification.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their relative
        positions.

        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot verify the locations

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Paco volcano would
        be "southwest or south of Lake Mainit, not east" - indicating different positions.
        Even with uncertainty about exact locations, the model based its NO on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer regarding whether Paco volcano is east of Lake Mainit. While there
        is some uncertainty in the analysis ("if it exists"), the model still provided
        a clear directional NO answer based on relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position. Instead, it indicates the North Shore
        Mountains are "more north than east" of Henry Hagg Lake, implying a different
        position. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 5, saying "the answer to whether the North Shore Mountains
        are located east of Henry Hagg Lake is NO." The answer is clearly stated and
        is making a directional comparison.

        are north of Henry Hagg Lake, indicating a different relative position. The
        model explicitly states they "cannot be east" because they are "more northward,"
        showing a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its geographic analysis. The
        NO is not a refusal to answer or an indication of inability to determine.

        similar longitudes" and are "almost at the same longitude," it specifically
        mentions that Lac la Nonne is "possibly being slightly east." Since it acknowledges
        a slight directional difference (even if tiny), this does not qualify as stating
        the values are exactly equal, and the NO answer appears to be based on the
        "not significantly east" assessment rather than perfect equality.

        the model determined Mount Talinis is east/southeast of the Yellow Sea, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer when determining if the Yellow Sea is east of Mount Talinis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Lake Izabal is west of Lac
        Vieux Desert, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Lake Izabal is east of Lac Vieux Desert, providing a clear
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they could be at "similar
        longitude," it specifically states that Lake Izabal is "likely west or at
        a similar east-west position." The mention of possible similarity is not given
        as the primary reason for the NO answer, and the model indicates a possible
        westward position. Therefore, this is not a case where equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Lake Izabal is located east of Lac Vieux Desert. This was
        a clear comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had considered
        the final "NO" as the answer, the model never stated the locations were equal
        - it actually emphasized that it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model gives "NO" at the very end, the bulk
        of the response indicates it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient
        location information and need for more research. The "NO" appears inconsistent
        with the reasoning given. Since the model clearly states it "cannot be directly
        determined without further research or clarification," this falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" in a box, the reasoning
        leading up to it clearly indicates that it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to insufficient information about Mount Mackenzie's location. The model
        explicitly states "it's not possible to definitively say whether it is east
        of Henninger Flats." This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

    5b5f1b96-d2a1-4a2d-8ee7-7f16cdfdb88a:

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, it heavily qualifies this answer by indicating it cannot make the determination
        without precise geographical reference data. The response essentially states
        it cannot verify the relative positions, making this a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

    6e1efaed-5dca-415b-9f98-8e674a159786:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it explains that Mount Mackenzie,
        being in British Columbia, is "north but not necessarily east" of California,
        suggesting a difference in position rather than equality as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Mount Mackenzie is east of Henninger Flats is NO" - this is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      result: 'NO'
    9f507ca1-4094-41fc-b23a-028c9dcb5bff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it arrives at NO based on assumptions about
        relative positions ("if Mount Mackenzie is indeed west of Henninger Flats
        or in a position that does not make it east of Henninger Flats"). While expressing
        uncertainty about exact locations, it does not claim the locations are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. Although it discusses uncertainty and multiple possibilities
        earlier, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Mount Mackenzie appears to
        be west or southwest of Mount Wilson (and thus Henninger Flats). The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative result to
        whether Mount Mackenzie is east of Henninger Flats.

        the locations were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due
        to lack of information about Mount Mackenzie's location. Since the model states
        it "cannot accurately determine its position" and gives NO because it "don't
        have specific information," this falls under the UNKNOWN category where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to insufficient information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model provides "NO" in a box at the end,
        the reasoning leading up to it indicates uncertainty and inability to make
        the comparison due to lack of information about Mount Sembrano's location.
        The model explicitly states "a definitive answer is challenging without more

        indicated the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the reasoning
        leading up to it explicitly states that it "cannot definitively answer the
        question without more specific information." This indicates the model is actually
        expressing inability to determine the answer, making this effectively a rejection

        location, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The
        NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify the eastward relationship
        rather than any statement about equal positions. Since the final answer was
        NO but not due to equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model indicates
        uncertainty about Siri Lake's location, it still provides a definitive NO
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as its final answer,
        it explicitly states it cannot determine the relative locations due to lack
        of information about Siri Lake. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison

        location to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as its final answer,
        it explicitly indicates it lacks specific information about Siri Lake's location
        and cannot make a definitive comparison. The model states "without specific
        details on Siri Lake's location" and notes this answer is based on "process
        of elimination" rather than actual comparison. This makes it a case where
        the model indicates it cannot determine the relationship.

        states "without specific information on Budi Lake, the most straightforward

        (stating Sevier Lake is "southwest or west" of the area where Little Salt
        Lake is likely located), not on the locations being equal or the same. The
        model clearly indicates there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning for why Sevier Lake would
        not be east of Little Salt Lake (stating it would be "southwest or west" instead).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined there
        was a directional difference (southwest vs east), not because the locations
        were equal. It explicitly states that Keenjhar Lake would be southwest of
        Iskanderkul, indicating a clear directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes that they are in different positions,
        with the Min Mountains being "more northward" relative to the Singapore Strait.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" after
        analyzing the relative positions of the Min Mountains and Singapore Strait,
        determining that the mountains are "not east" but rather "more northward"
        relative to the strait.
