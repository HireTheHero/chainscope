      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Caha
        Mountains are to the southwest" and "they are not to the east of the Lakes
        of Killarney." The model is indicating a directional difference (southwest
        vs. east), not equality.

        of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Caha Mountains
        are actually to the west/southwest of the lakes" which indicates a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (west/southwest
        vs east), not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparison question.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states "Upon closer inspection, the Putorana
        Plateau is west of the Karbi Anglong Plateau," indicating a difference in
        their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in positions, stating "the Putorana
        Plateau extends further west and the Karbi Anglong Plateau is located more
        to the east." The model's NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (one being west of the other), not on equality of values.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "the Putorana Plateau is primarily
        west of the Karbi Anglong Plateau" as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        identifies a directional difference (west vs. east) between the locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is situated far to the northwest of northeastern India, it is west of the
        Karbi Anglong Plateau." The model is indicating a directional difference (the
        Putorana Plateau is west of the Karbi Anglong Plateau), not equality. This
        difference is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO." at the

        Instead, it notes that "the longitudes of the two locations are close, but
        Putorana Plateau extends farther westward" and concludes it is "west of Karbi
        Anglong Plateau." The model is identifying a difference in position, not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that the Putorana

        in Oklahoma" and concludes that "West Hawk Lake is west of the Sans Bois Mountains."

        is not that the locations are identical, but rather that one entity (Mount
        Belinda) is contained within the other entity (Atlantic Ocean), not east of
        it. This is a positional relationship explanation, not an equality statement.

        of water having identical east-west positions.
