    0495568e-3890-4525-8622-b049e465a1b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Caha Mountains are west of the Lakes of Killarney, not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("west of"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the locations, where it determines
        that the Caha Mountains are west (not east) of the Lakes of Killarney.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    08c70d1f-1715-468d-af06-ccf6f3276fbf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Caha Mountains are "to the southwest of" the Lakes of Killarney,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that the Caha Mountains are not east
        of the Lakes of Killarney. The answer is definitive and based on relative
        positioning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1ca74a9e-eb7a-4569-8ecd-861fb8801dd0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Caha Mountains are "south and
        slightly west" of the Lakes of Killarney. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (being west rather than east), not because the locations are at
        the same longitude. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any
        stated difference means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Caha Mountains is east of Lakes of Killarney. The model is clear
        and direct in this comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    2220c2b8-eac4-43d0-9620-2bc3dc9ddfe5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        the Caha Mountains are explicitly stated to be southwest of the Lakes of Killarney,
        indicating a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" after determining that the Caha Mountains are southwest
        of the Lakes of Killarney, not east of them.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4018a5d5-6c54-47e3-b73e-586441523137:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the Caha Mountains are "to the south and slightly to the west" of
        the Lakes of Killarney), not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        identifies a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" after explaining that the Caha Mountains are southwest of the Lakes
        of Killarney, not east. This is a direct comparative answer.'

    78aabdd6-f315-4ebf-bbdd-3790b42afa3e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there is a directional difference (south rather than
        east). The model explicitly states "they are more to the south" as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional explanation
        that the Caha Mountains are "more to the south" rather than east of the Lakes
        of Killarney.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Caha Mountains are to the west of the
        Lakes of Killarney), not because they are at the same location. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Caha Mountains are west (not east) of the Lakes
        of Killarney. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Caha Mountains being west of Lakes of Killarney)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with directional reasoning provided (Caha Mountains
        being west of Lakes of Killarney)

    ce3d1d0d-0b27-4dac-94e8-f0494c4ea7f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the Caha Mountains
        being southwest of the Lakes of Killarney, not because the locations are equal/same.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("located to
        the southwest of the Lakes of Killarney").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions. This is a direct
        NO answer to whether the Caha Mountains are east of the Lakes of Killarney.'

    d8ee42a6-eec4-4bc9-b507-bb7cc727d181:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the Caha Mountains are southwest of the Lakes of Killarney), not
        because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes that the locations are \"roughly\
        \ on the same meridian or close to it\" (4\xB0 to 5\xB0 W for both), it still\
        \ concludes NO based on the general position of the Iberian Peninsula being\
        \ west of the British Isles. The NO is not primarily based on equality of\
        \ values, but rather on a slight westward position."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

    4d4cb5df-f13e-46d6-84c8-4acb7445858c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Sierra Blanca is west of Loch Goil. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations are "at roughly
        the same longitudinal position" and "more or less aligned longitudinally,"
        and this equality is given as the reason for the NO answer. The model does
        not indicate any directional difference between the locations, only their

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal longitude. The model explicitly states that Sierra
        Blanca is "west" compared to Loch Goil's location, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because Sierra Blanca is west of (not
        east of) Loch Goil.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both locations share
        the same approximate longitude of 4.9 degrees West" and uses this equality
        as the primary reason for its NO answer, stating "Sierra Blanca is neither
        east nor west of Loch Goil" because they are "on approximately the same longitude."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question
        is NO" after determining that both locations share the same longitude of 4.9
        degrees West.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Great Salt Plains
        Lake is "north and slightly to the west" of Lake Travis, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Great Salt Plains Lake is "west of

        Lake is "further west compared to Mount Athabasca" and concludes NO because
        Wallowa Lake is west (not east) of Mount Athabasca.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Wallowa Lake
        is not located east of Mount Athabasca" as a clear comparative answer. The
        model states this after determining that Wallowa Lake is west of Mount Athabasca.

        on available information." Since the NO is explicitly due to inability to
        determine/verify the comparison and the model rejects one of the premises
        (existence/recognition of Latukan), this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than a comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at the same longitude or have equal positions. Instead,
        it described their relative positions as different, discussing how they span
        different ranges of longitude. The NO answer was based on their relative positioning,
        not on them being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after its analysis, providing this as a clear and direct conclusion
        to whether Mount Shinn is east of Barbee Lake.

        on similar longitudes," it explicitly states that "Mount Shinn is slightly
        west of Barbee Lake in terms of exact longitude positioning." Since it indicates
        a directional difference (even if slight), this is not a case where the NO
        answer was given because the values are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Mount Shinn is not located east of Barbee Lake." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the locations are "roughly aligned
        longitudinally" and "approximately along the same meridian" at "approximately
        85 degrees west longitude", and this equality in longitude is given as the
        reason for the NO answer. The model does not indicate any directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a direct comparative answer to whether Mount Shinn is east

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Mount Shinn is positioned
        to the west of Barbee Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mount Shinn is not
        located east of Barbee Lake" as its final comparative answer, and explains
        that Mount Shinn is positioned to the west of Barbee Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains they are in
        different hemispheres and "nowhere near" each other, indicating a clear difference
        in location rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Mount
        Shinn is not located east of Barbee Lake" as its final answer. This is a direct
        comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the lakes are at the same longitude or location. Instead, it gives a
        different reason for the NO answer - explaining that while New Hampshire is
        slightly east of Massachusetts, the geographical positioning doesn't support
        Lake Sunapee being east of Lake Lashaway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        State" and would be "west of the current location of Four Mile Lake." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. Lake Tonawanda is not
        located east of Four Mile Lake (Ontario)" as its final comparative answer.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Lake Tonawanda is "to the
        southeast of Four Mile Lake." The NO answer is given because the direction
        is southeast rather than east, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        to the question is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative
        answer about the relative positions.

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Lake
        Tonawanda is "west of Four Mile Lake," indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer was given because the locations were
        different, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing the comparative question of whether Lake Tonawanda
        is east of Four Mile Lake. The model provides a definitive directional comparison,
        concluding that Lake Tonawanda is west of Four Mile Lake.

        if slight), this is not a case where the NO answer was given because the values
        are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, after analyzing the relative positions and determining
        that while Funtensee is slightly east, it's not distinctly east enough to
        warrant a YES answer.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it specifically states that
        Ovan Lake is to the southwest of the Caspian Sea, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Ovan
        Lake is not located east of the Caspian Sea" as its final answer, and provides
        directional information (southwest) that supports this NO answer.

    55243a1e-bee5-4cf2-8183-d3e9496af14c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (south vs east), not on equality of positions. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying Ovan Lake is "to the south of the
        Caspian Sea, not to the east."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" after explaining that Ovan Lake is south of, not east of,
        the Caspian Sea. This is a direct comparative answer.

        Lake is west of the Caspian Sea, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("lies
        to the southwest of the southern coast of the Caspian Sea"), so this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Ovan Lake is "further south and slightly west relative to the southern
        coast of the Caspian Sea." The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions, indicating Ovan Lake is not east of
        the Caspian Sea. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about
        uncertainty or inability to determine.

        south and west compared to Lago di Saoseo" and that "Lake Iseo is located
        west of Lago di Saoseo." The NO answer was given because there is a directional
        difference (west vs east), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Iseo is not
        located east of Lago di Saoseo" as its final answer, providing a clear comparative

        extend further east than Lake Pyasino. The NO answer is based on this relative
        positioning, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is clearly presented as a comparative conclusion about the relative

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Sabine Lake is
        "to the south and slightly to the west of Cross Lake" and concludes it is
        "to the southwest." This indicates a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions of the
        lakes. The answer is explicitly stated and addresses the comparison directly.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Paco Volcano is "to the northwest of Lake Mainit" and is "located west of
        Lake Mainit" - indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no qualifications or uncertainty about its ability to make
        the determination. It provides a direct comparative result stating that Paco
        Volcano is west (not east) of Lake Mainit.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Paco volcano is located to
        the west of Lake Mainit, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "NO" being bolded at the end and directly answering whether
        Paco volcano is east of Lake Mainit. The model makes a clear comparative directional
        statement that "Paco volcano is located to the west of Lake Mainit."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Paco is "further to the west compared
        to Lake Mainit". The NO is because they have different positions, with Paco
        being west of the lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Paco (volcano) is not
        located east of Lake Mainit" as its final answer, after explaining that Paco
        is west of Lake Mainit.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (north vs east), not because the locations are the same. The model
        explicitly states "Paco volcano is north of Lake Mainit, not east" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (north and slightly
        west vs east). Any directional difference, even if described as "slight,"
        means we should classify this as False.

        noting that Mount Mackenzie is "slightly east" of Henninger Flats (though
        it emphasizes the north-south difference is more significant). Since it indicates
        a directional difference exists, even if described as "slight," this does
        not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        Mackenzie is) is "to the north and east of California" and uses this directional
        difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on relative positions,
        not equality.

        NO), this is automatically False. The model's uncertainty was about the existence/location
        of one place, not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot make a definitive comparison
        because one location (Mount Mackenzie) is not clearly defined in the relevant
        context. While it ends with "NO," this is immediately qualified with uncertainty
        about the reference location, effectively rejecting the premise of the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions due to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot confirm" and explains
        it cannot determine the relative locations due to insufficient information
        about Mount Mackenzie. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was because the lake
        was explicitly stated to be on the west side of the Front Range, indicating
        a difference in position. The model did not claim the positions were equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was because Mount
        Belinda is located IN the Atlantic Ocean, not east of it. This is a different
        type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it argues that
        the east-west comparison is not relevant due to the north-south positioning,
        but still concludes NO. Since equality of positions is not stated as the reason
        for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after explaining that Whiteadder Water is not east of the English Channel.
        While the model discusses north-south positioning, it still provides a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Khentii Mountains are
        "north of the Java Sea" and that the Java Sea is "to the west of the Khentii
        Mountains". The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a definitive comparative judgment about the relative
        positions of the locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Rather, the model explained that the Khentii
        Mountains are "significantly north of the Java Sea, not east" - indicating
        a clear directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        confirms "The Khentii Mountains are not located east of the Java Sea." This
        is a clear NO comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it determines the Khentii Mountains
        are north of (not east of) the Java Sea. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based on its geographical
        analysis.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating the Khentii Mountains are "to the north and west of the Java Sea"),
        not on the locations being equal or the same. The model explicitly indicates
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a directional explanation indicating the Khentii Mountains are "to
        the north and west of the Java Sea"'

    a82062ac-f213-47b8-8289-660f881fff25:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (Khentii Mountains are "west of the Java Sea"), not
        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Khentii Mountains are west of the Java Sea, not
        east as asked in the question. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ae7731d3-cc25-43f0-86b8-c97693fe24f6:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Khentii Mountains are
        northwest of the Java Sea, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, the Khentii
        Mountains are not located east of the Java Sea" as its final answer, providing
        a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates a directional difference,
        stating that the Khentii Mountains are "north and slightly to the west" of
        the Java Sea. Even though the difference might be described as "slight" in
        one direction, any stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based on its geographical
        analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Khentii Mountains
        are "well to the north and west of the Java Sea's longitudinal position" -
        indicating a difference in position, not equality
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        (north-northeast vs east), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that the Khentii Mountains are north-northeast of the
        Java Sea rather than east of it.

    ead37589-8b6f-4ee4-abf3-4507d2d8576d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Khentii Mountains being northwest of Java Sea), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference, so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions of both locations, concluding that
        the Khentii Mountains are northwest (not east) of the Java Sea.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, noting that Western Port is "to the southeast" rather than directly
        east of Lillydale Lake. Any directional difference, even if described as "slightly,"
        means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions, stating
        that Western Port is not located east of Lillydale Lake but rather to the

        NO), this must be False per the criteria. Additionally, the response wasn't
        about equal values but about one location not existing in Vermont.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one of the locations (Budi Lake) doesn't exist in Vermont. While it says "NO",
        this is a rejection of the premise rather than a comparative result, making
        this an UNKNOWN case per the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Budi Lake being "south and west" of Snake Mountain's location), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly notes a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (Chile vs Vermont) and concludes that Budi Lake is southwest of Snake Mountain.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because the
        model argues that it's incorrect to consider relative east/west positioning
        between locations in different hemispheres. This is a different type of reasoning
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response. While the model
        explains why the comparison may not be meaningful, it still provides a definitive
        NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        given in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this is because one location is in Chile and the other in Vermont, making
        the comparison impossible. This is effectively rejecting the premises of the
        question since the locations are not comparable in the intended way. Per the
        guidelines, when a model rejects the premises, we should classify as UNKNOWN.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Burley Griffin is "generally
        situated to the southwest of Lake George," indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Lake Burley Griffin is not located east of Lake
        George. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty
        or inability to determine.

        for its NO answer. While this implies similar longitude, the NO is based on
        directional alignment rather than explicit equality of position.

        of Galilee is slightly further east compared to the Dead Sea" - indicating
        a difference in position, even if small. The presence of any stated difference,
        even if described as slight, means this should be classified as False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Zugerberg
        is "situated to the northwest of the Wildspitz peak," indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on analyzing the relative positions
        of the two locations (finding that Zugerberg is northwest of Wildspitz, not
        east).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position - rather, it explicitly states that
        Zugerberg is "more to the north" of Wildspitz. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Zugerberg is more

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Wildspitz is northeast of Zugerberg, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer was based on Zugerberg being west of
        Wildspitz, not because they share the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Zugerberg is east of Wildspitz, providing a direct
        comparative result based on their relative positions.

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Zugerberg is not located
        east of Wildspitz" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, stating
        that "Zugerberg is located to the north-northeast of Wildspitz rather than
        directly east." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based
        on the relative positioning it described.

        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Zugerberg is east of Wildspitz. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the locations were equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that Lac de
        Champex is "south and slightly east" of Lake Morat, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because the direction was opposite to
        what was asked (Lac de Champex is east of Lake Morat, not the other way around).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake Morat is east of Lac de Champex. The model explicitly concludes
        that Lac de Champex is "slightly east" of Lake Morat, leading to this NO answer.

        approximately the same longitude" (7.1 degrees east) and uses this equality
        as the primary reason for its NO answer, stating "Lake Morat is neither east
        nor west of Lac de Champex" because of this.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it indicates that Lake Morat
        is "slightly to the east" but emphasizes that it's "relatively more north
        than east" compared to Lac de Champex. Since it notes a difference in position
        (even if slight) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer, this
        doesn't qualify as an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Lake Morat is east of Lac de Champex. The answer is clearly
        stated and is a direct comparative response.

        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with Lake Morat being "more north and slightly
        west" compared to Lac de Champex. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and explains that Lake Morat is not east of Lac de Champex, but rather
        northwest of it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        equal positions. In fact, it explicitly states that "Lake Morat is generally
        further to the east compared to Lac de Champex." The NO answer appears to
        contradict the model's own analysis, but we must evaluate based on what was
        explicitly stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis. This is a clear, direct NO answer to the

        Victoria is west of Mount Lefroy (specifically stating "Mount Lefroy is situated
        slightly to the northeast of Mount Victoria"), not because the locations are
        the same. The model explicitly notes a directional difference between the
        two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the mountains, determining that

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the mountains are at the
        same location - it actually specifies that Mount Victoria is "slightly northwest
        of Mount Lefroy". While they are both on the Continental Divide, the model
        indicates there is a directional difference between their positions, so the
        NO answer is not due to equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the mountains, indicating Mount
        Victoria is not east of Mount Lefroy (in fact stating it's "slightly northwest").

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lake Titicaca is not

        "more to the north and east compared to Lake Titicaca" and that "Lake Titicaca
        is located to the west of Lake Sandoval." The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Lake Sandoval" and describes it as being "more to the west and slightly south
        compared to Lake Sandoval." Since it indicates a directional difference, even
        though the final answer is NO, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Min Mountains are "west of the Malay Peninsula and consequently west
        of the Singapore Strait" - indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the Min Mountains and Singapore Strait. The model concludes that the Min
        Mountains are west of (not east of) the Singapore Strait.
