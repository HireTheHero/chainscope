      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Caha Mountains
        are located to the southwest of the Lakes of Killarney, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Caha Mountains are
        not located east of the Lakes of Killarney." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Caha Mountains are southwest of the Lakes of Killarney, which contradicts
        the premise that they would be east. The model explicitly states "the Caha
        Mountains are positioned to the southwest of the Lakes of Killarney" and "they
        cannot be east of them." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the Caha Mountains
        are southwest of the Lakes of Killarney, not east of them, and explicitly
        concluded with "NO" at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "the Caha Mountains are positioned
        to the southwest of the Lakes of Killarney" and therefore "cannot be east
        of them." The model is indicating a clear directional difference (southwest
        vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Caha Mountains are east of the Lakes of Killarney.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Caha Mountains are southwest
        of the Lakes of Killarney, indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the mountains are southwest of the lakes, not east
        of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question about whether the Caha Mountains are east of the Lakes of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "The Caha Mountains
        are positioned to the southwest of the Lakes of Killarney, meaning they are
        west (not east) of the Lakes." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (southwest/west vs. east) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        the Caha Mountains are east of the Lakes of Killarney.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (southwest vs east),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the Caha Mountains and the Lakes
        of Killarney. The model concludes that since the Caha Mountains are southwest
        of the Lakes of Killarney, they cannot be east of them.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Sierra Blanca is WEST of
        Loch Goil, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially made an error in its reasoning,
        stating that Sierra Blanca would be east of Loch Goil. It then corrected itself,
        concluding that "Sierra Blanca (Andalusia) is WEST of Loch Goil, not east"
        and gave a final answer of "NO". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. While it notes they have "similar longitudes,"
        it specifically says "neither is significantly east or west of the other on
        a global scale" and then explains that Antarctica would not be considered
        east of Michigan in conventional interpretation. This indicates a reasoning
        based on geographical interpretation rather than exact equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Saskatchewan is east of
        Colorado" and therefore answers NO to what appears to be a question about
        whether Jackfish Lake is west of La Plata Mountains. The NO is based on a
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized
        an error in its analysis and corrected itself to "YES" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its response after reconsidering
        the geographical positions of the lakes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tilyar Lake is located
        to the northwest of Paravur Lake, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Tilyar Lake is not located
        east of Paravur Lake." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "Tilyar Lake is
        NOT located east of Paravur Lake. In fact, it's either slightly to the west
        or approximately at the same longitude." The model indicates there may be
        a slight difference (with Tilyar Lake being "slightly to the west") or they
        may be approximately the same, but it doesn't definitively state they are
        equal as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Tilyar Lake is located east of Paravur Lake. The answer is clearly
        stated at the end of the response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tilyar Lake is to
        the west of Paravur Lake, indicating a difference in their positions. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Tilyar Lake is located to the west of Paravur Lake,
        not to the east" and then gives a clear "NO" as the final answer to the comparative

        in position is the reason for the NO answer, not any equality between the
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Tilyar Lake is west of Paravur Lake. The model
        concludes that "Tilyar Lake is located east of Paravur Lake" and then gives

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Shankaracharya Temple is actually
        slightly to the west of Borith Lake, not east." The model is noting a difference
        in position (slightly to the west), not equality. The reason for the NO answer
        is that the temple is slightly west of the lake, not that they are in the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model first gave a "NO" answer, then reconsidered and still concluded
        with "NO" but for a different reason. Since the model clearly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" at the end, the final answer is NO.

        Lake is not positioned at a higher longitude (more eastern) than Hesaraghatta
        Lake," which allows for either equality or a westward position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. Instead, it notes that the plateaus are at "roughly similar longitudes"
        and that "Putorana Plateau is slightly to the east or at similar longitude
        as Karbi Anglong Plateau." The mention of "slightly to the east" indicates
        a difference, even if small. The model is not basing its NO answer on the
        locations being exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the

        The model states "they are at roughly the same longitude, neither is significantly
        east or west of the other" and "the North Shore Mountains might be slightly
        west of Henry Hagg Lake." Since the model notes this slight directional difference
        rather than claiming exact equality, this doesn't qualify as a NO based on
        equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically notes a difference in position,
        stating that "Whiteadder Water is located in eastern Scotland, but this puts
        it north and slightly west of the English Channel, not east of it. The English
        Channel is actually east and south of Whiteadder Water's position." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (Whiteadder Water being north and slightly
        west, while the English Channel is east and south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after analyzing the geographical positions of Whiteadder Water and the English
        Channel. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't verify the existence of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Siri Lake is located east of the Gulf of Ob because I cannot verify the
        existence or location of a geographical feature called 'Siri Lake'". This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison because
        it cannot verify the existence of one of the locations. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category as per the criteria.

        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot confirm" which indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about Siri Lake.
        The model is not making a definitive comparative statement but rather expressing

        The model indicates uncertainty about the exact east-west relationship, but
        does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        information confirming the existence or location of a lake with this name."
        This is not a straightforward NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer because it lacks information about one

        the two locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of Sproat Lake and Beaufort Range.
        The model determined that Sproat Lake is west of the Beaufort Range, not east
        of it, and provided this as a direct comparative result.

        Range" and "Since Sproat Lake is to the west of the Beaufort Range, it cannot
        be east of it." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Sproat Lake is to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Min Mountains are located to the northwest of Singapore Strait, not to
        the east as the question presumably asked. The model identified a directional
        difference (northwest vs east), not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Min Mountains are not
        located to the east of Singapore Strait, but rather to the northwest.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "Min Mountains
        are located at roughly the same longitude or slightly west of Singapore Strait,
        not east of it." The mention of "slightly west" indicates a difference in
        values, even if small. The model is not saying NO because the locations are
        identical, but because Min Mountains are either at similar longitude or slightly
        west (not east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Min Mountains are
