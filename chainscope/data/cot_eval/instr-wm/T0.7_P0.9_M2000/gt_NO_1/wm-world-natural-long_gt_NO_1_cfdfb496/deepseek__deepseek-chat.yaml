      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        the model determined the Caha Mountains are southwest of the Lakes of Killarney,
        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" as its comparative conclusion, based on determining that the Caha Mountains
        are southwest (not east) of the Lakes of Killarney.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that the Caha Mountains
        are to the west of the Lakes of Killarney, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that the Caha Mountains are not located east of the
        Lakes of Killarney. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the Caha Mountains are "situated to the west"
        of the Lakes of Killarney. The NO is because they have different positions,
        not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states the Caha Mountains are southwest of
        the Lakes of Killarney, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because
        they are in a different direction (southwest) than what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Caha Mountains are east of the Lakes of Killarney, providing
        a direct comparative result based on their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or that they have the same east-west position. Instead, it
        explains that Mount Shinn is "not directly east or west of Barbee Lake but
        rather far to the south." The NO answer is based on their different positions,
        not on them being at equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mount Shinn is not
        located east of Barbee Lake" as its final answer. While it explains that the
        relationship is more south-oriented, it provides a clear NO to the east comparison.

        was being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a bolded final answer.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that Shankaracharya
        Temple is west of Borith Lake, not east).

        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        being equal - it explicitly states that Lysefjord is west of Lake Annecy,

        being east) is incorrect, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Lysefjord is west of Lake Annecy, not east. This is
        a direct comparative answer to the question.

        that Lake Iseo is south of Lago di Saoseo, not east. Since the NO answer is
        based on a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Morskie Oko is
        southeast of the Gorce Mountains, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Morskie Oko is not
        located east of the Gorce Mountains" as its final answer. This is a clear

        southeast of the Gorce Mountains, indicating a different relative position.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states that
        "Lac la Nonne is west of the Snake Range because it is located further west
        in Canada." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Lac la Nonne is not east of the Snake Range.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (with Lac la Nonne being west of Snake Range), not
        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Lac la Nonne is northwest of Snake Range, indicating
        different locations. The NO is because the direction is different (northwest
        instead of east), not because the locations are the same.

        - it explicitly states the Khangai Mountains are west of Qinghai Lake, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO is because the relationship is opposite to
        what was asked (west instead of east), not because the locations are the same.

        Belinda is located within the Atlantic Ocean rather than east of it. The model
        did not state that the locations were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" and explains that Mount Belinda is not east of the Atlantic Ocean because
        it is within it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Ross
        Lake is west of Quesnel Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer was given because Ross Lake is west (not east) of Quesnel Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (Ross Lake is
        "southwest of Quesnel Lake"). Even though the final answer was NO, it was
        not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Ross Lake is west (not east) of Quesnel Lake. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that Mount Victoria is west of Mount Lefroy, not east. This difference
        in position is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the mountains
        are in the same location - it explicitly states that Mount Victoria is west
        of Mount Lefroy, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the
        relationship is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive statement that Mount Victoria is not east
        of Mount Lefroy (it's west). This is a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        mountains are in different positions (Mount Victoria being west of Mount Lefroy),
        not because they are in the same location. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Lower Saranac Lake is "west of Lake Kanawauke" and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no qualifications or uncertainty about its ability to make
        the determination. The answer directly addresses the comparative question.

    8eaf996d-bb65-4f7b-b5f5-b108052dc1d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        Lower Saranac Lake is "significantly northwest" of Lake Kanawauke, not because
        the locations are at the same position. It explicitly notes a difference in
        position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        the relative positions it analyzed.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, indicating that Lower Saranac Lake is northwest
        of Lake Kanawauke. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lower Saranac Lake is east of Lake Kanawauke. This
        is a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Lower Saranac Lake is explicitly stated to be northwest of Lake Kanawauke,
        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this answer (indicating Lower Saranac Lake is northwest, not east,
        of Lake Kanawauke).

        results in False for question 2, regardless of any discussion of values or
        equality in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Lower Saranac
        Lake is located east of Lake Kanawauke." This is a clear, direct YES answer
        to the comparison.

    b1acfacb-2ade-415a-9a8f-4a842d03c8fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (north vs southeast) and gives the directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer ("Since Lower Saranac Lake is north of Lake Kanawauke, not east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion when comparing the locations, making this a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (southeast vs east), not because the locations are at the same
        position. It explicitly states there is a difference in position, with one
        being southeast of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
