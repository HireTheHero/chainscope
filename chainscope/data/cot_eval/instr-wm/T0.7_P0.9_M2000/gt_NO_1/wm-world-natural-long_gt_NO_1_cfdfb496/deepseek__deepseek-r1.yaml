      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the mountains are southwest, not east), not on the values being equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that the Caha Mountains
        are not east of the Lakes of Killarney, but rather to the southwest.'

      result: 'NO'
    102f6b67-3661-4cdc-8717-4a28b8326b52:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Caha Mountains are southwest of the Lakes of Killarney, not because the locations
        are the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (southwest vs east), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer about
        the relative positions (stating the mountains are southwest, not east).'

    3b408bf2-f9cd-4b7a-aec0-057af8ad074d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since this only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response, after working through its reasoning about the relative
        positions of the Caha Mountains and Lakes of Killarney.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    87dc2132-4749-4e16-bba6-46c33ec2f31e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Caha Mountains are west of the Lakes
        of Killarney), not because they are in the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that the Caha Mountains are not east of the Lakes
        of Killarney because they lie west of them.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8e9ccde8-8b18-47e6-af6c-063595b9b4c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Caha Mountains are southwest
        of the Lakes of Killarney, indicating a clear directional difference. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the geographical locations
        it discussed. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparative relationship
        asked about.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bb09fae8-6891-46ad-802e-374cf8e68c71:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with the Caha Mountains being to the west/southwest of the Lakes of Killarney.
        Even though this might be a small difference, any stated directional difference
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly stating that the Caha Mountains are not east of the Lakes of Killarney.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bd0c99df-d169-48e5-9c0d-f820a11040dd:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the Caha Mountains
        being southwest of the Lakes of Killarney, not because the locations are equal/same.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("the Caha Mountains
        are southwest of the Lakes of Killarney"), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO." after determining
        that the Caha Mountains are southwest of the Lakes of Killarney, not east
        of them. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and maintains

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Glenrock Lagoon is southwest
        of Port Stephens, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including in its final answer, and provides a specific directional
        comparison (southwest vs east) as justification.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It considers multiple possibilities
        (Eastman Lake in California vs Oregon) and different scenarios, but ultimately
        ends with "But I don't have that information. So perhaps I need" without making
        a final determination. The response shows uncertainty about the location of

        one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response concludes with "Paco Volcano is
        probably not located east of Lake Mainit," this is not presented as a definitive
        NO answer. Throughout the response, the model expresses uncertainty about
        Paco Volcano's existence/location and ultimately cannot make a clear determination.

        volcano named Paco to the east. The NO is based on geographical differences,
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and concludes that

        conclusion, and provides a clear comparative answer about the location, stating
        "Paco Volcano is not located east of Lake Mainit." While the model questions

        Lake Mainit. The model suggests the volcano may not exist in that location
        rather than stating the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, providing it as a clear comparative conclusion. While
        the model expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does make a definitive
        NO statement rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine
        the relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it's
        not because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO is given
        because the model concludes that "Paco Volcano does not exist in that location"
        and cannot find evidence of such a volcano east of Lake Mainit. This is a
        different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is based on a comparative geographical assessment (even though
        it includes uncertainty about one location's existence). The model does not
        convert this into an UNKNOWN despite noting uncertainty - it maintains the
        NO answer based on its reasoning.

        without providing a clear YES/NO answer. While the model extensively analyzes
        the relative positions and considers various interpretations, it never reaches
        a definitive conclusion. The last sentence even suggests multiple possible

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence, but
        the final comparative statement clearly indicates that "Ross Lake is west
        of" Quesnel Lake, which directly answers NO to whether Ross Lake is east of
        Quesnel Lake. The model worked through various coordinates and ultimately

        this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer - the primary reason

        Lake Gunn is west of Moke Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on directional difference (Lake Gunn being west, not east
        of Moke Lake), not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that Lake Gunn is west of Moke Lake, with Moke Lake being "farther east."
        Since the NO answer is based on this directional difference rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that Lake Gunn is west (not east)
        of Moke Lake. The answer is a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Lake Gunn
        is southwest of Moke Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their positions. The NO was based on Lake Gunn being west (opposite of east),
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with bold formatting, after determining that Lake Gunn lies
        southwest of Moke Lake (not east).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lakes are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Lake
        Gunn is west of Moke Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that Lake Gunn is not east of Moke Lake because Lake
        Gunn is west of Moke Lake. This is a direct comparative answer to the original
        question.
