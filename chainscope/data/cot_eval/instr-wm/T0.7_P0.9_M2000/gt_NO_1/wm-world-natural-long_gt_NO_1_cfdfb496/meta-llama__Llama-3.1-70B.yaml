      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same east-west position. Instead, it states they are
        "generally in the same longitudinal (east-west) direction" but gives the NO
        answer because "they are not located in an east-west relationship." This is
        not the same as saying they are equal/identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographical analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        the Caha Mountains are likely more west or south of the lakes. Since the NO
        is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a clear and unambiguous way, making this a definitive NO answer to
        the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, noting
        that the Lakes of Killarney are "slightly to the north of the Caha Mountains"
        and concludes NO based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that the Caha Mountains are "more in the south or southeast direction
        from Lakes of Killarney." The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" as its conclusion after reasoning through the geographical
        positions.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined the Caha Mountains are southwest of (not east of) the Lakes
        of Killarney, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographical analysis
        showing the Caha Mountains are southwest of, not east of, the Lakes of Killarney.'

    699f8492-77f8-4fef-b3af-9fcd071eda84:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - rather, it indicates they are both in southwest Ireland but
        gives directional reasoning for why one is not east of the other. The NO answer
        is based on relative positioning, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as its conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, concluding
        that Caha Mountains are "likely located west of Lakes of Killarney" rather
        than east as asked in the original question. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions (southwest vs
        central) and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Caha
        Mountains is west of Lakes of Killarney, not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Caha
        Mountains is west of Lakes of Killarney"), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        after explaining that Caha Mountains is west of Lakes of Killarney, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Sierra Blanca is south or
        southwest of Loch Goil, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that
        Sierra Blanca is south of Loch Goil rather than east of it. The model identifies
        a clear directional difference (south vs. east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative result based

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Sierra Blanca is west
        of Loch Goil ("Sierra Blanca in Andalusia is generally west of Loch Goil in
        Scotland"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determined
        Sierra Blanca is "south and west of Loch Goil" - not because the locations
        are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model explicitly states
        a directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that they "are not in a direct east-west
        alignment" as the reason for its NO answer. The explanation indicates there
        is a directional difference (one being in southern Spain and the other in
        western Scotland).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        Sierra Blanca is southwest of Loch Goil, not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("southwest of") rather than equality.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Sierra Blanca
        is southwest of Loch Goil, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        was given because Sierra Blanca is southwest rather than east of Loch Goil.

        locations are different (with Sierra Blanca being west of Loch Goil), not
        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Great
        Salt Plains Lake is north of Lake Travis, and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model does not claim the locations are
        equal or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically stating that Great Salt Plains Lake
        is west of Lake Travis. The NO is not due to the locations being equal/same/identical,
        but rather due to finding a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was based on the model's
        reasoning that Great Salt Plains Lake is north of Lake Travis, not east of
        it. The model identified a directional difference (north vs. south) as the
        basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it concludes NO because Wallowa Lake is south
        of Mount Athabasca, not east of it. The model explicitly states they "are
        not directly east-west of each other" and describes a different relative position
        ("south").

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Wallowa Lake is west of Mount Athabasca, indicating a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        that Wallowa Lake is west (not east) of Mount Athabasca.

    b8bc16e1-c7e4-4802-aa96-03582bb1b76a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Wallowa Lake being south of Mount Athabasca) rather than the locations being
        equal or the same. It identifies a specific directional difference rather
        than equality as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning, providing a direct comparative conclusion.

    c26d6e89-3aa4-4900-8802-1dcfa5f7770b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Wallowa Lake is west of Mount Athabasca, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Wallowa Lake is west (not east) of Mount Athabasca.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

    c2dee566-a1ac-48e3-8b14-a2df9afb7cde:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Wallowa
        Lake is west of Mount Athabasca, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Wallowa
        Lake is west of Mount Athabasca"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        after explaining that Wallowa Lake is west of Mount Athabasca and therefore
        not east of it. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Wallowa Lake is south of Mount Athabasca rather than east of it. The model
        identifies a specific directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because Wallowa Lake is south of Mount
        Athabasca rather than east. The model identifies a clear directional difference
        (south vs. east), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a directional
        difference (southeast vs east), not because the values were equal. It explicitly
        states "Latukan is not directly east of Mount Ragang but rather southeast
        of it" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions (northern vs central Mindanao) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about their relative positions
        due to lack of specific geographical information. The NO answer appears to
        be based on this uncertainty rather than any assertion that the locations
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a boxed format at the end of its response. However, this NO appears
        to be indicating inability to determine rather than a comparative result,

        not explicitly state they are at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates.
        The model actually suggests there is some relative positioning between them,
        just not enough to support an eastward relationship. Since equality is not

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Mount Shinn is west of Barbee Lake, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer was given because one location is west of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives other reasons for its NO answer, primarily
        citing complexity due to different hemispheres, geographical distance, and
        Earth's curvature. It also suggests the question might be based on unclear
        premises.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        between the locations as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating that Lake Sunapee is north of Lake Lashaway), not because the locations
        have equal positions. The model never states that the locations are at the
        same longitude or have equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative answer to
        whether Lake Sunapee is east of Lake Lashaway.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Lake Sunapee is west of Lake
        Lashaway, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply couldn't determine
        their relative positions due to uncertainty about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does give "NO" as its final answer,
        it explicitly states it "cannot accurately determine the location" and indicates
        the question has "incorrect or unclear premises." This makes it clear the
        model is rejecting the ability to make the comparison rather than making a
        comparative judgment, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      result: UNKNOWN
    81f28af3-cffd-4466-befb-23ea14f7ae20:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the lakes being
        at the same location or having equal coordinates. Instead, the model concludes
        NO because Lake Sunapee is north of Lake Lashaway, which it uses to determine
        that Sunapee cannot be east of Lashaway. The response indicates a difference
        in position (one being north of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        as its conclusion, based on its analysis of the geographical positions of
        the lakes. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Sunapee is
        "north and west of Lake Lashaway" and concludes NO because Sunapee is "west
        of Lake Lashaway" rather than east. The model identifies a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" in a boxed format, providing a definitive comparative answer

        (stating Lake Sunapee is north of Lake Lashaway), not because the locations
        are the same. The model explicitly identifies a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        reasoning.

    a21a6e36-8b14-48ba-8f52-da5ad2ce226f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even if we had counted the boxed NO
        as the final answer, the model never claimed the locations were equal - it
        stated it couldn't determine one location's existence/position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the answer due to uncertainty
        about Lake Lashaway's existence/location ("we cannot accurately determine").
        Since the model rejects the premises of the question by indicating one location
        may not exist or be identifiable, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite
        the "NO" box at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        difference between the two locations.

        share a border, it does not explicitly state they are at the same longitude
        or exactly equal in position. Instead, it states they "are not in an east-west
        relationship" as its reasoning for the NO answer. This is not the same as
        stating they are at equal positions.

        for its NO answer. Even though this is a logical geographical relationship,
        the presence of any stated directional difference means we must classify this
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

        is "actually west of Lake Annecy". The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Lac
        Courte Oreilles was determined to be north of Lake Wissota, indicating a different
        relative position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, concluding that Lac Courte
        Oreilles is not east of Lake Wissota because it is north of it.

        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Lac Courte Oreilles is north of Lake Wissota (not east). The NO is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Lake Molveno is southeast of Eibsee), and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that it lacks sufficient information to
        determine their relative positions ("we need more specific information about
        their exact locations"). The NO answer appears to be based on inability to
        verify the relationship, not because the locations are equal.

        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were at equal positions - it simply stated it
        couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer
        at the end. However, in the reasoning steps, it states "we cannot definitively
        say whether Paco Volcano is located east of Lake Mainit" and indicates uncertainty
        about relative positions. Since the model indicates it cannot determine the
        comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        (that North Shore Mountains are north of Henry Hagg Lake, not east), not because
        the locations have equal positions. The model identifies a clear directional
        difference between the locations, so this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is because the locations
        are in different hemispheres and "not directly east-west aligned." This is
        a difference-based explanation rather than an equality-based one.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - rather, it indicates they are in different regions of the state
        ("they are not directly east-west of each other" and "are located in different
        regions of the state"). The NO answer is based on relative positions being
        different, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Lost Lake being
        west of Upper Klamath Lake, not because the lakes are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between their
        positions, with Lost Lake being west of Upper Klamath Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the lakes,
        where it concludes that Lost Lake is west (not east) of Upper Klamath Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating Lost Lake is west of Upper Klamath Lake), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning was that
        the lakes are in different parts of Oregon (west vs south) and "are not in
        an east-west orientation relative to each other." The NO is based on their
        different positions, not their equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

        Atlantic Ocean's main body, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        are equal. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that Mount
        Belinda is part of the Atlantic Ocean itself, rather than being east of it.
        This is a logical relationship reason rather than an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "the final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Western Port is south of Lillydale
        Lake, indicating a different relative position. The NO answer is based on
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer, explaining
        that Western Port is in the southern part while Lillydale Lake is in the southeastern
        part. Since the NO answer is based on different positions rather than equality,
        this is False.

        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Western Port is southeast of Melbourne while Lillydale Lake is east of Melbourne,
        indicating different positions. The NO is based on their different relative
        positions, not on equality.

        that "Western Port is not east of Lillydale Lake, but rather it is west or
        southwest of it." Since it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Western Port is west of Lillydale Lake, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Western Port
        is west of Lillydale Lake, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer not because the locations
        are equal/same, but because it determines Chip Lake is north of Jarbidge Mountains
        rather than east. The model describes a directional difference (north vs east)
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or that they are the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - explaining that Chip Lake is north of Jarbidge Mountains
        rather than east of it. The model indicates these are different locations
        with different positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Chip Lake is north of Jarbidge
        Mountains and therefore cannot be east of them. The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it concludes NO because Chip Lake is north
        of the Jarbidge Mountains, indicating a different relative position rather
        than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it states they have a different relative
        position (with Chip Lake being north of the Jarbidge Mountains). The model
        explicitly gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Chip Lake is not located east of the Jarbidge
        Mountains (instead saying it is north).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "in approximately
        the same east-west position," this is not presented as exact equality and
        is not the primary reason for the NO answer. The model states they are "not
        in a clear east-west relationship," suggesting uncertainty or complexity rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Chip Lake
        is "west of Jarbidge Mountains" and the NO answer is given because they have
        different positions relative to each other. The model indicates a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presenting it as a definitive comparative result based on geographical analysis.
        The answer is boxed and follows from a clear logical progression concluding
        that Chip Lake is west, not east, of Jarbidge Mountains.

        Lake Manych-Gudilo is described as being "north or northeast of Lake Van"
        rather than east. Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather

        are different and provides reasoning about their distinct continental positions
        and the improbability of direct east-west alignment.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are in different continents separated
        by the Atlantic Ocean, and that the concept of "east" is less relevant in
        this context. The NO answer is based on this geographical separation rather
        than any equality of position.

        were equal - it stated they were in entirely different countries.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because one location (Budi Lake) is not in Vermont at all, making the comparison
        impossible. This is a rejection of the premises rather than a comparative
        result, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        being equal - it explicitly states that Mar Chiquita Lake is west of Chances
        Peak, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO is based on the opposite relationship being true (west instead of east),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Mar Chiquita
        Lake is east of Chances Peak. The model states it is "actually west" instead.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates
        that it cannot accurately determine their relative positions due to lack of
        specific coordinate data. The NO appears to be based on inability to verify
        the eastward relationship rather than equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Sevier Lake being west of Little Salt Lake), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Sevier Lake is not east of Little
        Salt Lake (stating it is actually west)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer, specifically
        that Sevier Lake is south/southwest of Little Salt Lake rather than east of
        it. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "UNKNOWN". This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information about the locations' positions.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different parts
        of Uttarakhand (Satopanth Tal in the western part and Nainital Lake in the
        eastern part), and this difference in position is the reason for the NO answer.

        between the two locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative response to whether Satopanth
        Tal is east of Nainital Lake. The model concludes that Satopanth Tal is actually

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determines
        that Turtle Lake is west of Halgurd (not east), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Georgia, where Turtle Lake (Tbilisi) is located, is generally
        west of Iraq, where Halgurd is situated").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Turtle Lake is located "to
        the north and west of Halgurd" - indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        Turtle Lake is northwest of Halgurd (indicating a directional difference),
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states
        a directional difference ("Georgia, where Turtle Lake is located, is generally

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Lower Saranac Lake is north of Lake Kanawauke rather than east of it. The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concludes NO because Lower Saranac Lake
        is north of Lake Kanawauke, indicating a different (not equal) position. The
        model explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative result based
        on geographical positioning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Lower Saranac Lake is north of Lake
        Kanawauke, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines Lower Saranac
        Lake is north/northeast of Lake Kanawauke, indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as its final answer, but the
        reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack
        of information about Lake Kanawauke's location. Since the model explicitly
        states it "cannot accurately determine the location" and suggests the premises
        might be unclear, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at equal
        positions - instead, it explains that Lower Saranac Lake is north of Lake
        Kanawauke, and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        The NO is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        same longitude or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that Lower Saranac Lake is north of Lake Kanawauke.
        The model does not base its NO answer on equal values.

        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Lake Lahontan (reservoir)
        in Nevada is west of Harney Lake in Oregon").

        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" and provides directional reasoning that Lake Gunn is west of
        Moke Lake, not east.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Lake Gunn being southwest of Moke Lake), not because the locations are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        as its conclusion, based on its analysis that Lake Gunn is southwest of Moke
        Lake and therefore cannot be east of it.'

        that Lake Gunn is west of Moke Lake, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the geographical positions of the two lakes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Lake Gunn is south of Moke Lake, not east of it. The model identifies a directional
        difference between the locations as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
