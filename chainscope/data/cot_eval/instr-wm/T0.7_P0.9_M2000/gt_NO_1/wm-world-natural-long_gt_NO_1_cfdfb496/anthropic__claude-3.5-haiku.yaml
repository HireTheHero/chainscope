      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Caha Mountains being west of Lakes of Killarney), not because
        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its determination that Caha Mountains are west (not
        east) of Lakes of Killarney.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2652bb7b-aac5-4273-b0ef-cfbbaef3c3a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the Caha Mountains are explicitly stated to be west of (not east of) the Lakes
        of Killarney. The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" after determining that the Caha Mountains are west of,
        not east of, the Lakes of Killarney. This is a direct comparative NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the Caha Mountains
        being west of the Lakes of Killarney, not because the locations are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("the Caha Mountains are west of the Lakes of Killarney").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result regarding the relative position of the Caha Mountains to the Lakes
        of Killarney.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Caha Mountains are
        west of Lakes of Killarney, not east)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        position (stating Caha Mountains are west, not east, of Lakes of Killarney)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        different (Caha Mountains being west of the Lakes of Killarney), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states "the Caha Mountains
        are actually west of the Lakes of Killarney" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

    d5d6a772-c93b-4504-82f8-247ff16bd4da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that Caha Mountains are west of Lakes of Killarney, not east), not
        because the locations are equal or the same. It explicitly notes a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on geographical
        analysis.'

      result: 'NO'
    d8e5f463-8b93-4ab8-a51e-fb5122dd75a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Caha Mountains are west of Lakes of Killarney). The NO is based
        on the direction being opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative directional reasoning that Caha Mountains
        are west, not east, of Lakes of Killarney.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ef6bb647-eeda-482a-b5b2-f5c31a9727a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states they
        are in different positions, with the Caha Mountains being west of the Lakes
        of Killarney. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" after determining that the Caha Mountains are west, not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Caha Mountains are west of the Lakes
        of Killarney), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the locations and determining that
        the Caha Mountains are west (not east) of the Lakes of Killarney.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that "Great Salt Plains Lake is
        west of Lake Travis" and gives this directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal. The model explicitly
        states "Great Salt Plains Lake is actually west of Lake Travis," indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The NO was given because Great Salt
        Plains Lake was determined to be northwest of Lake Travis, indicating a directional
        difference. The model did not claim the locations were at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Great Salt Plains Lake is west of Lake Travis" and "Lake Travis is
        east of Great Salt Plains Lake". The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion of its analysis and once as a final standalone answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Wallowa Lake is west of Mount Athabasca, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Wallowa Lake is west of Mount Athabasca, not
        east of it. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        is east of Wallowa Lake (indicating different positions), and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location
        doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains that
        the comparison is impossible because Lake Tonawanda doesn't currently exist.
        Since the model rejects the premises of the question by stating one lake doesn't
        exist, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot provide a YES or NO answer" due to insufficient
        information. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated one lake doesn't exist for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the lakes (Lake Tonawanda) is prehistoric and no longer exists. While
        it says "NO", it immediately qualifies this by stating it "cannot be meaningfully
        answered", indicating it's rejecting the ability to make the comparison rather
        than making a comparative conclusion.

        were equal - it stated one lake no longer exists and therefore couldn't make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively determine"
        and "cannot confidently say YES or NO" but then provides "NO" only because
        it was required to give a YES/NO answer. Since the model explicitly indicates
        it cannot make the determination and rejects the premise (one lake no longer
        exists), this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the forced "NO" at the
        end.

        entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but rejects the premise by stating one lake is not in Ontario. When a model

        the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does give a "NO" answer, it explicitly
        states this is because one of the lakes (Lake Tonawanda) no longer exists
        and is in a different location entirely. The model rejects the premises of
        the question by stating "the concept of being 'east' or 'west' of Four Mile
        Lake doesn't apply." This makes it a case where the model is rejecting the
        ability to make the comparison.

        one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot verify the
        volcano's location)" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information. This is effectively stating an inability to determine
        rather than a comparative result, making it an UNKNOWN response per the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states they are in different
        locations and the NO is because North Shore Mountains is west of (not equal
        to) Henry Hagg Lake's longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether North Shore Mountains is east of Henry Hagg Lake.
        The answer is given directly and definitively.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, North Shore

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that North Shore Mountains
        are west of Henry Hagg Lake, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        was given because the premise of the question (east of) was opposite to the
        actual relative position (west of) that the model determined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative location question, providing a direct answer
        without any caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.

        of Henry Hagg Lake" - indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and "North Shore
        Mountains are NOT located east of Henry Hagg Lake" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives other reasons for the NO answer, including
        that the locations are "too far apart to have a simple east-west relationship"
        and "in different regions separated by significant distance." The NO is based
        on inability to make a direct comparison, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and states
        "North Shore Mountains are not definitively located east of Henry Hagg Lake."
        This is a clear NO comparative answer.

        other." The NO answer is based on their different positions and lack of direct
        east/west alignment, not on equality.

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Bear Lake
        is located west of Knoll Lake").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Bear Lake is west (not east) of Knoll Lake. This is
        a direct comparative answer.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is due to insufficient information to determine the relative positions.
        Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        states that La Poudre Pass Lake is "west of the Front Range, not east," indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of La Poudre Pass Lake
        and the Front Range. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined the lake is specifically west of the Front Range, indicating
        a difference in position. The model did not state or suggest the positions
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its reasoning that the

        of it. This is a difference in position (inside vs. east), not an equality
        statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion about the location of La Poudre
        Pass Lake relative to the Front Range.

        their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Gulf St Vincent was explicitly stated to be west of the Akaishi Mountains,
        indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        and that Gulf St Vincent is west of the Akaishi Mountains. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Gulf St Vincent is NOT east of the Akaishi Mountains."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states they are in different locations and that
        Gulf St Vincent is west of the Akaishi Mountains. The NO is given because
        the premise (Gulf St Vincent being east of Akaishi Mountains) is incorrect,
        not because the locations are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        Gulf St Vincent is west of the Akaishi Mountains, not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        between the locations, describing them as being on opposite sides of the Pacific
        Ocean.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, without any caveats
        about uncertainty or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "roughly at the same
        longitude," it explicitly states this is not the reason for its NO answer.
        Instead, it concludes NO because "from the perspective of a global map, Gulf
        St Vincent would be west of the Akaishi Mountains." The presence of a directional
        difference (being west) means this is not an equality-based NO.

        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it cannot determine the relative locations due to insufficient
        information. This makes it a case of "NO, I cannot determine" which should
        be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confidently determine the relationship due to lack of
        information about one location. This is effectively stating it cannot make
        the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal - rather, it states it cannot confidently determine Siri Lake's location
        and gives NO due to insufficient evidence. It never claims the locations are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While it shows hesitation,
        it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that Sproat Lake is west of the Beaufort
        Range, not east. This directional difference, not equality, is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of Sproat Lake and Beaufort Range. The model specifically states that "Sproat
        Lake is west of the Beaufort Range" and therefore answers "NO" to whether
        it's east of the range.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm the
        statement with certainty)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison.
        This is effectively stating it cannot verify the relationship, making this
        an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it states it "cannot confidently
        say Mar Chiquita Lake is east of Chances Peak" due to their being "thousands
        of miles apart" and that "directional relationship between them cannot be
        meaningfully determined." This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        answer, and while it expresses uncertainty about the comparison, it deliberately

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it stated the
        reason was that "the locations are too geographically distant to have a meaningful
        east/west relationship." This is not a statement of equality, but rather a
        statement about the difficulty of comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it explains that the comparison is not meaningful. Since it provided
        a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify), this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same in position. Instead,
        it notes they are "thousands of miles apart" and in "different hemispheres."
        The NO answer appears to be based on inability to determine the relationship
        rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, despite earlier indicating it "cannot give a definitive YES or NO
        answer." While there is some contradiction, we must take the final explicit
        "NO" statement as the model's answer per the instructions to not resolve contradictions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and "I do not have enough information to answer this question

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Sierra del Carmen
        is west of Reindeer Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Sierra del Carmen is west of Reindeer Lake. This is
        a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sierra del
        Carmen is to the southeast of Reindeer Lake, indicating different positions.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and specifically concludes "Sierra del Carmen is NOT east of Reindeer
        Lake" - this is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Sierra
        del Carmen is west of Reindeer Lake and that the locations are "quite far
        apart, in different parts of North America." The NO answer was based on a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Sierra del Carmen is east of Reindeer Lake. The model
        provides a step-by-step analysis leading to this conclusion and explicitly
        states that Sierra del Carmen is west of Reindeer Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5be96e2c-50d3-42c6-be08-ce4d03cf3b62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Sierra del Carmen "would be west of Reindeer Lake" and that the locations
        are "quite far apart, in different parts of North America." The NO answer
        was given because one location is west of the other, not because they are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that Sierra del Carmen is
        not east of Reindeer Lake. The model actually indicates Sierra del Carmen
        is west of Reindeer Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Sierra del Carmen is west of Reindeer Lake, indicating a difference in position
        as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        answer, and this NO is based on a direct comparative assessment (Sierra del
        Carmen being west of Reindeer Lake, not east)'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Sierra del Carmen is west of Reindeer Lake, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on the western (not eastern) relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after a step-by-step analysis, concluding that Sierra del Carmen is west of
        Reindeer Lake, not east. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Sierra del Carmen is west of Reindeer Lake, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states that Sierra del Carmen is west of Reindeer Lake, not
        east. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d02915d4-a462-43bf-b4e2-bf999b6e19ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states they are "quite
        far apart" and on "opposite sides of the continent," with Sierra del Carmen
        being west of Reindeer Lake. The NO is based on a clear directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about whether Sierra del Carmen is east
        of Reindeer Lake. The answer is explicit and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot determine the relative positions due to insufficient
        information about one location. This is effectively stating it cannot make
        the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions. Since
        the model states "I cannot confidently determine the answer" and gives NO
        because of this uncertainty, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than
        NO, as it's expressing inability to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        one location's position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer this question with a simple YES or NO"
        due to insufficient information about one location. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't confirm their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the relationship. This is effectively
        stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a definitive NO comparative result.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and indicates it cannot determine the geographical
        relationship. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.

        claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively state" the
        relative locations due to lack of information about one location, but then
        gives "NO" as its final answer. Since this indicates an inability to make
        the comparison while providing a NO answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        per the guidelines.

        automatically results in False. The model did not make any claims about equal
        values - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information. It does not make a comparison
        but rather indicates it cannot determine the relationship.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it cannot determine the relative locations ("I
        cannot confidently determine the answer"). When a model says NO because it
        cannot determine or verify something, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        per the instructions.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm it is east
        of the MacDonnell Ranges)" - this is a case where the model explicitly states
        it cannot determine the relationship, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a
        NO comparative result. The parenthetical clarification shows this is about
        inability to verify rather than a comparative conclusion.

        "further northwest" and Lake Kanawauke is "further southeast", indicating
        different positions. The NO is based on Lower Saranac Lake being west of (not
        east of) Lake Kanawauke.
