      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Pickensville is
        west of East Bangor" - indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer was given because the locations have different positions
        (west vs. east), not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Pickensville, AL located east of East Bangor, PA?" The
        model explains that Pickensville is west of East Bangor, and therefore concludes
        with a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.

        and concludes that "Since Fairfax Station is west of Muttontown, the answer
        is: NO"'

        to the question "Is Russells Point, OH located east of Stirling, NJ?" The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Russells Point,
        OH is west of Stirling, NJ, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (west
        vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the question of

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Russells Point is west of Stirling (not east). The model explicitly states
        "Ohio is west of New Jersey" and "Therefore, Russells Point, OH is west of
        Stirling, NJ" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Russells Point is east of Stirling. The model explains
        its reasoning by determining that Russells Point, OH is west of Stirling,
        NJ (not east), and explicitly concludes with "NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Russells Point is west of
        Stirling because Ohio is west of New Jersey. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Russells Point is NOT east of Stirling, NJ.

        New Jersey" and "Russells Point is in western Ohio" while "Stirling is in
        eastern New Jersey." The model concludes that "Russells Point is west of Stirling's
        location" - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, indicating that Russells Point is NOT east of Stirling. This is
        a direct comparative answer to the question.
