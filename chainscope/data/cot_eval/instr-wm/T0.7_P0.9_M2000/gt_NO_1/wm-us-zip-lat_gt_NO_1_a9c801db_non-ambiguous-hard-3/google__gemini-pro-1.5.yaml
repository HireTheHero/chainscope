      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Virginia is south
        of New Jersey, and therefore zip code 22134 in VA is likely south of zip code
        07852 in NJ. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 22134 (in Virginia)
        is south of 07852 (in New Jersey) because Virginia is generally south of New
        Jersey. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of
        values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 22134 is numerically
        lower than 07852, and infers that the Virginia zip code is south of the New
        Jersey zip code. The model is noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Virginia is south
        of New Jersey, which indicates a difference in location rather than equality.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 22134 is numerically lower
        than 07852, and uses this difference to support its NO answer. The model is
        noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Virginia is south
        of New Jersey, and therefore zip code 22134 in VA is likely south of zip code
        07852 in NJ. The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated comparison
        (possibly "is zip code 22134 north of zip code 07852?"), but it's not based
        on equality of values.

    d1dca6a4-4e5d-4baa-8817-eb6720a59804:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Virginia is south of New Jersey
        and that the specific zip codes correspond to different locations (Woodbridge
        area in Virginia and Northwest New Jersey). The model's reasoning indicates
        a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e057d5ea-94fe-4984-ba12-4bb3c06e94d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 22134, VA is likely south
        of 07852, NJ, indicating a difference in location (one is south of the other).
        The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but I'm evaluating
        only what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

    f320dcec-1a81-49ea-a25c-e98370b8912a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Virginia is south of New Jersey, so a location in Virginia
        will be generally south of a location in New Jersey. The model is indicating
        a difference in position (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly answers the comparative question. The model concludes "22134,
        VA is NOT north of 07852, NJ" and then gives a clear "NO" as the final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Virginia is generally
        south of New Jersey, which would suggest a difference in location, not equality.
        The model's "NO" answer appears to contradict its own reasoning (since if
        Virginia is south of New Jersey, the answer might be expected to be "YES"),
        but I'm evaluating only what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "California is south of Oregon" and "any zip
        code in California will be south of any zip code in Oregon." The model is
        indicating a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" based on its reasoning that
        California is south of Oregon, suggesting a directional difference rather
        than equality. The model is asserting a geographical relationship (California
        being south of Oregon) as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the geographical relationship between
        California and Oregon.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that California is south of Oregon,
        which indicates a difference in geographical position, not equality. The model's
        "NO" answer appears to be based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the geographical relationship between
        California and Oregon.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "California is south of Oregon" and "any zip code in California will
        be south of any zip code in Oregon." The NO answer appears to be rejecting
        some unstated premise in the original question, but it's not because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "California is generally south of Oregon" and therefore
        "94585, CA is not north of 97330, OR." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that 94585, CA is not north of 97330, OR.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Kentucky is entirely south
        of Indiana" and concludes that "any Kentucky zip code will be south of any
        Indiana zip code." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (south
        vs. north), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 42141 (Kentucky) is less
        than 46565 (Indiana) and uses this along with geographic knowledge to conclude
        that Kentucky is south of Indiana, not north. The model is noting a difference
        in values and locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Kentucky is generally
        south of Indiana, which suggests a directional difference rather than equality.
        The "NO" appears to be contradicting the premise of the question (which we
        can infer was asking if a Kentucky zip code is north of an Indiana zip code),
        but the model does not base this on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Kentucky is significantly
        south of Michigan" and "any location in Kentucky will be south of any location
        in Michigan." The model is indicating a clear directional difference (south),
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it notes that "Kentucky is significantly south
        of Michigan" which indicates a difference in position. The model's reasoning
        contradicts its final answer (since it concludes Kentucky is south of Michigan
        but then says NO), but we are instructed to take the explicit statements at
        face value without resolving contradictions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Texas is south of Arkansas" and therefore "a location in Texas
        is highly unlikely to be north of a location in Arkansas." The model is indicating
        a difference in position (south vs. north), not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Nebraska is south of North Dakota" and concludes that "any zip code
        in Nebraska will be south of any zip code in North Dakota." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Nebraska is south of North
        Dakota, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO
        answer is based on this directional relationship, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Nebraska is directly south of North Dakota" and "Any location in Nebraska
        will be south of any location in North Dakota." The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Nebraska is south of North
        Dakota, and therefore 68506, NE is south of 58401, ND. The NO answer appears
        to be rejecting some unstated premise in the original question (likely about
        whether one location is west of the other), not because the locations are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, after concluding that "68506, NE is south of 58401,
        ND."
