      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Northern New Jersey is generally
        further north in latitude than Northern Virginia" and concludes that "22134,
        VA (Quantico, VA) is located south of 07852, NJ (Ledgewood, NJ)". The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (south vs. north), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to
        the question of whether 22134, VA is located north of 07852, NJ.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes that the latitudes are different (38.522 for
        Quantico, VA and 40.903 for Landing, NJ) and uses this difference to justify
        its NO answer. The model states "40.903 (Landing, NJ) is greater than 38.522
        (Quantico, VA)" as the reason for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        In fact, it states that "Ledgewood, NJ (07852) is located north of Quantico,
        VA (22134)" indicating a difference in location, not equality. The NO answer
        appears to be given because the model determined that ZIP code 22134 is NOT
        north of ZIP code 07852 (rather, it's the opposite).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lincoln, NE is
        south of Jamestown, ND" and that "zip code 68506, NE is located south of zip
        code 58401, ND." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (south
        vs. north), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal latitude values. Instead, it explains that
        Nebraska is south of North Dakota, and specifically that Lincoln, NE (68506)
        is "geographically situated well south of Jamestown, ND (58401)." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (south vs. north), not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, 68506
        in Nebraska is not located north of 58401 in North Dakota." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same latitude or location. Instead, it explains that 58401 (Jamestown,
        ND) is positioned at a higher latitude compared to 68506 (Lincoln, NE), and
        that "Jamestown, ND is further north than Lincoln, NE." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in latitude, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer to the question is NO. 68506, NE is not located north of 58401,
        ND." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
