      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Virginia is located south of New Jersey"
        and therefore "a zip code in Virginia will generally be located south of a
        zip code in New Jersey." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that the zip code 22134, VA is NOT located north

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Virginia is located south of New Jersey, and therefore
        a zip code in Virginia (22134) is not located north of a zip code in New Jersey
        (07852).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that New Jersey is actually further
        north than Virginia, indicating a difference in latitude positions. The model
        concludes that "07852, NJ is located north of 22134, VA" which is the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that it believes 22134, VA is not north of 07852,
        NJ. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 22134 (Virginia) is south
        of 07852 (New Jersey), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded NO after reasoning that
        "Virginia is located south of New Jersey" and "22134, VA is located south
        of 07852, NJ." The model is stating there is a directional difference (south
        vs. north), not equality. The NO appears to contradict the model's own reasoning,
        but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is explicitly stated as
        "Answer: NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.'

        that "Virginia is located south of New Jersey" and "22134, VA is located south
        of 07852, NJ." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional relationship,
        not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Virginia is south
        of New Jersey geographically, and therefore the Virginia zip code (22134)
        is south of the New Jersey zip code (07852). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 22134, VA located north of 07852, NJ?". The model clearly
        concludes that the Virginia zip code is south of the New Jersey zip code,
        not north.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 77360 (Spring, TX) is south
        of 72601 (Mountain Home, AR), and therefore 77360 is NOT located north of
        72601. The reason for the NO answer is based on a directional difference (south
        vs. north), not equality.

        west of 72601 (Arkansas), and specifically concludes that "77360, TX is NOT
        located north of 72601, AR" because Texas is south of Arkansas. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 29033, SC located north of 24179, VA?" The model explains

        Dakota. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with the Nebraska zip code being south of the North Dakota zip
        code. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 68506, NE located north of 58401, ND?" The model provides
        reasoning that Nebraska is south of North Dakota, and therefore the Nebraska
        zip code (68506) is south of the North Dakota zip code (58401).
