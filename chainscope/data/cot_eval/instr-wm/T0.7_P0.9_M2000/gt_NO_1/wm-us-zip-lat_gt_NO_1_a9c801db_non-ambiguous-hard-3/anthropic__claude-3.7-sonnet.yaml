    0971de2d-0cd7-48c7-83eb-9733caba274e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal values. Instead, it explicitly states that
        22134 (Quantico, VA) is south of 07852 (Long Valley, NJ), indicating a difference
        in their geographic positions. The reason for the NO answer is that one location
        is south of the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "22134, VA is NOT located north of 07852, NJ" and
        ends with a clear "NO" statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that zip code 27704 (in North
        Carolina) cannot be north of zip code 14892 (in New York) because New York
        is north of North Carolina. The model is indicating a difference in latitude
        positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that New York is north of North Carolina, so the zip code in
        NC cannot be north of the zip code in NY. The model is noting a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that the zip code in NC (27704)
        cannot be north of the zip code in NY (14892).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        of a directional difference - Virginia is north of South Carolina, so zip
        code 24179 (in VA) would be north of zip code 29033 (in SC), not the other
        way around. The reason for the NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, with no qualifications
        or uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        positions, with Virginia being north of South Carolina. The model specifically
        states "it's the opposite - 24179, VA is located north of 29033, SC." This
        indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "29033, SC is
        NOT located north of 24179, VA."

        Carolina which is south of Virginia (where zip code 24179 is located). The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (South Carolina being south
        of Virginia), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that since 97227 is in Oregon
        and 98229 is in Washington, and Washington is north of Oregon, the zip code
        in Oregon cannot be north of the zip code in Washington.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different states with different relative positions (Washington is north
        of Oregon). The NO answer is based on the determination that 97227 is south
        of 98229, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 97227, OR is north of 98229, WA. The model concludes
        that since 97227 is in Oregon and 98229 is in Washington, and Washington is
        north of Oregon, 97227 must be south of 98229 (not north of it).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e6b0a099-473e-487f-a1ee-db87d2d8fb8b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 97227 is located south of
        98229, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        reason for the NO answer is that one location is south of the other, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 97227, OR is not
        located north of 98229, WA. It is located south of it." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e6bf386b-8765-4025-be1c-1d2b53950681:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal values. Instead, it explains that 97227 is
        in Oregon which is south of Washington where 98229 is located. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (one being south of the other), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 97227 in Oregon is
        not located north of 98229 in Washington." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    00a04f55-f52e-4ca0-888c-10364ed5fbbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that North Dakota is
        north of Nebraska, and therefore 58401, ND is north of 68506, NE. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 68506, NE is north of 58401, ND. The model clearly
        concludes that the opposite is true - that 58401, ND is north of 68506, NE.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Nebraska is entirely south
        of North Dakota, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 68506, NE is north of 58401, ND. The answer is clearly stated at
        the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because the locations are in different
        positions, with the Nebraska zip code being south of the North Dakota zip
        code. The model states "It's the opposite - the Nebraska zip code is south
        of the North Dakota zip code."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 68506, NE is not
        located north of 58401, ND." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 68506, NE is south
        of 58401, ND, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 68506, NE is not
        located north of 58401, ND. It is located south of it." This is a clear NO

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically that "Nebraska is located south of North Dakota"
        and therefore "68506, NE (in Nebraska) cannot be north of 58401, ND (in North
        Dakota)." The model is indicating a difference in position (south vs. north),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that 68506, NE is not north of 58401, ND. This is a clear comparative
