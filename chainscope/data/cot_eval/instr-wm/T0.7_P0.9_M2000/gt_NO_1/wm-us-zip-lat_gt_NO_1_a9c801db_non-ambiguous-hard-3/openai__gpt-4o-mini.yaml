      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Virginia (22134)
        is south of New Jersey (07852), indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The model concludes "22134 cannot be north of 07852"
        because of their relative geographic positions, not because they are at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and reiterates "Final Answer: NO" at the end of its response. The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Virginia is located to the
        south of New Jersey" and concludes that "Quantico, VA (22134) is in Virginia,
        it is south of Washington, NJ (07852)." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion to whether 22134, VA is located north of

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Dumfries, VA (22134)
        is south of Stanhope, NJ (07852)" and "it follows that 22134 is located further
        south than 07852." The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (south vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Virginia is generally
        south of New Jersey" and that 22134 "is still south of the latitude of 07852
        in New Jersey." The NO answer is based on one location being south of the
        other, not on them being equal.
