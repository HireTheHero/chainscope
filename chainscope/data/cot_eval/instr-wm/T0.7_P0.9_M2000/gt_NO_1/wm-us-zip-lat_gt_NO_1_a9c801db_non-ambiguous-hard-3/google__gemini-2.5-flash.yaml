      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that any zip code in Virginia
        will be south of any zip code in New Jersey, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The model is saying NO because the Virginia
        zip code is south of the New Jersey zip code, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 22134, VA is located north of 07852, NJ. The answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that New Jersey is north of Virginia,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The model
        concludes that New Jersey is geographically north of Virginia, which is why
        22134, VA is not north of 07852, NJ.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 22134, VA is located north of 07852, NJ. The answer

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 22134, VA is NOT north of 07852, NJ
        because Virginia is south of New Jersey. The model indicates a clear directional
        difference (New Jersey is north of Virginia), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO." at the end of its

        "40.8 degrees North is north of 38.9 degrees North." The NO answer is given
        because the model determined that the second location is north of the first,
        not because they are equal.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that New Jersey is north of Virginia,
        and therefore any point in New Jersey (including 07852) will be north of any
        point in Virginia (including 22134). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that New Jersey is geographically
        north of Virginia, indicating a difference in position. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that "a zip code in New Jersey will always be north of
        a zip code in Virginia," which contradicts the premise of the original question
        (which presumably asked if 22134, VA is north of 07852, NJ).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        of 14892, NY, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The model's reasoning is that New York is north of North Carolina, and even
        though Watkins Glen is in the southern part of New York, it's "still at a
        higher latitude (further north) than Durham, NC."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are different,
        with New York being north of North Carolina. The model states "New York State
        is significantly to the north of North Carolina" and concludes that "any location
        within New York (like 14892) will be north of any location within North Carolina
        (like 27704)." The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that "27704,
        NC is not located north of 14892, NY" and reinforces this with "NO" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Charleston is south of McLean, not north of it. The model identified
        a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Charleston, SC (29418)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the latitudes are different
        (28.5 degrees North for Florida vs 34.2 degrees North for Georgia) and concludes
        that Florida is south of Georgia because 28.5 is less than 34.2. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after analyzing the latitudes of the two locations and determining that 32818,
        FL is south of 30566, GA, not north of it.

        that North Dakota is north of Nebraska, meaning a ZIP code in North Dakota
        would be north of a ZIP code in Nebraska. The model is making a directional
        comparison, not stating the locations are equal.
