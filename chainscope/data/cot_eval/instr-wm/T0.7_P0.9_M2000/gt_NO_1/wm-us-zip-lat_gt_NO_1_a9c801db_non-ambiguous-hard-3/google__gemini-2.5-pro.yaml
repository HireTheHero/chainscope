      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in\
        \ values: \"41.19\xB0 N is a higher latitude than 38.87\xB0 N. This means\
        \ McAfee, NJ is geographically north of Merrifield, VA. Therefore, Merrifield,\
        \ VA is south of McAfee, NJ.\" The model's NO answer is based on this difference\
        \ in latitudes."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model explicitly states "NO" as the last word in its
        response after providing its step-by-step reasoning.

        \ on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that zip code 22134 is not located north of zip code 07852. This
        is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that zip code 22134 (VA) is not north of zip code
        07852 (NJ), but rather south of it, as indicated by the latitude comparison
        showing Long Valley, NJ is north of Merrifield, VA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Oregon is north of California,
        and therefore Corvallis (in Oregon) is north of Suisun City (in California).
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Suisun City, CA is not north of Corvallis, OR. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain a final answer.
        It only shows the beginning of a thought process where it identifies the question
        is about comparing geographical positions of two zip codes, but it doesn't
        proceed to give any YES/NO conclusion. There is no explicit answer provided.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Corvallis, Oregon (97330)
        is geographically north of Suisun City, California (94585), indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 94585 is not north of 97330. This is a clear negative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "Oklahoma is situated entirely north
        of the state of Texas. Therefore, Tulsa, Oklahoma is geographically north
        of Bryan, Texas." The model is indicating that one location is north of the

        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        - that New York is geographically located north of North Carolina, and therefore
        Durham, NC is south of Wellsville, NY. The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is located north of Miami, Florida, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that 33187, FL is not north of 31632, GA, but
        rather is south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hahira, GA is north
        of Miami, FL, indicating a difference in their geographical positions. The
        model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The answer is clear and directly addresses the comparative
        question about whether 33187, FL is located north of 31632, GA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        Kentucky (40108)" and that "Kentucky is located entirely north of the state
        of Alabama." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. In step 4 of its reasoning, it clearly concludes that the question
        asking if 35951, AL is north of 40108, KY is false, and provides a definitive

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Bingham Canyon, UT is north of Clarkdale,

        Edmond]; it is south." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is geographically north of Houston, Texas" and that this is "the opposite
        of the actual geographical relationship" being asked about. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Oregon is north of California, and therefore a California location cannot
        be north of an Oregon location. The model is noting a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        of California, and therefore Portland, Oregon (97236) is north of Cloverdale,
        California (95425). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 95425 is north of 97236. The model clearly concludes

        95425 (California) because Oregon is located entirely north of California.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
