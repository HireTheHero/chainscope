      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are exactly equal. It states that "Adirondack Lake is at approximately
        the same latitude as the Pioneer Mountains or slightly north" and concludes
        that "the Pioneer Mountains are not clearly north of Adirondack Lake." This
        indicates a possible slight difference (with Adirondack Lake potentially being
        slightly north), not an exact equality. The model is expressing uncertainty
        about a clear directional relationship rather than asserting equality.

        at a similar or slightly higher latitude than the Pioneer Mountains." This
        indicates a potential small difference rather than equality, and this difference
        is the basis for the NO answer.
