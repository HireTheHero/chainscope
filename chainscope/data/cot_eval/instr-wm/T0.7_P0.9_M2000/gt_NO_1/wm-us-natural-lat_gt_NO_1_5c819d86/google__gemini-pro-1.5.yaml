    0b0fdbe1-df91-4211-9ec0-f46690b2cc7e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it concluded NO because Prien Lake is "east, not north"
        of Lake Conroe, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5555ea80-5856-4494-a513-007efd2a8967:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it concluded NO based
        on reasoning that Prien Lake is likely south of Lake Conroe (indicating a
        difference in latitude, not equality). The model notes a directional difference,
        even if potentially small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after going through its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO answer
        without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a difference in position, stating
        that "Prien Lake... is generally east and a bit south of Lake Conroe." Since
        it indicates a directional difference, even if the actual distance might be
        small, this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it gave a directional difference, stating that Madera
        County is "generally south of" Mono County as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Eastman Lake is not north of Crazy Lake.

    5ad09047-bd01-4db4-a7ef-caf5d963c0e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        (Madera County being south of Mono County), not because the locations are
        at the same position. It indicates a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal - it actually concludes that Eastman Lake is south
        of Crazy Lake. The NO appears to be a direct response to the original comparison
        question (likely asking if Eastman Lake is north of Crazy Lake). The values
        being compared (latitudes) are explicitly stated to be different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning steps.

    689f5c01-69d5-46d7-bdb7-867cc35e43cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it
        determines Eastman Lake is south of Crazy Lake (a directional difference).
        The presence of any directional difference, even if slight, means this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it determined NO based on a difference in position,
        stating that "Madera County is south of Mono County." Since it indicates a
        directional difference (south vs. north), even though this is based on county
        locations, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that Eastman Lake is not north of Crazy Lake. This is a
        clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it noted that Madera County is "generally south of"
        Mono County, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer appears to
        be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are at a "similar latitude,"
        it explicitly states that Stoneman Lake is west of Shinall Mountain, indicating
        there is a directional difference. The NO answer is based on the fact that
        one location is west but not north of the other, not because they are exactly
        equal in latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional explanation that Stoneman Lake is west
        but not north of Shinall Mountain.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Stoneman Lake was likely
        south of Shinall Mountain (due to Arizona being south of Arkansas), indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning about the geographical locations
        of the two places.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the Animas Mountains are west of the Peloncillo
        Mountains and concludes that west does not imply north. The NO is based on
        rejecting the implication between west and north positions, not on any equality
        between values.

        being west of the Peloncillo Mountains, not because they are at the same latitude.
        The model does not state that the mountains are at equal latitudes - it simply
        states that one is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it notes
        that the Animas Mountains are west of the Peloncillos and "not significantly
        north." Since it identifies a directional difference (west) and doesn't base
        its NO answer on equality of positions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it notes some complexity in the comparison. Since it provides
        this clear NO answer, we classify it as NO rather than REFUSED (which would
        require explicitly refusing to answer) or UNKNOWN (which would require indicating

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        positions, indicating California is significantly west of Oklahoma and suggesting
        Lake of the Arbuckles is "very unlikely" to be north of Bristol Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating Lake of the Arbuckles is not north of Bristol
        Lake.

    134ef8f7-1c8b-4ed3-a2fb-85bb77618405:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted differences in position, stating that Galveston
        Bay is southwest of Trinity Bay and that Trinity Bay is north of Galveston
        Bay. The NO answer was based on these positional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the bays, making this a clear
        NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the bays
        are in the same position - it actually stated that Trinity Bay appears to
        be "directly north of" Galveston Bay, indicating a clear positional difference.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not because of equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the bays,
        where it determined Trinity Bay is above Galveston Bay.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that "Galveston
        Bay is generally south of Trinity Bay," indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the relative positions
        it identified, not a refusal or inability to determine.

    4e1b44dd-42da-420a-b5d0-a87ecb691867:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Galveston
        Bay to be south/southeast of Trinity Bay, not because the bays are at the
        same location. It explicitly states a directional difference, so this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Galveston Bay is south/southeast of Trinity Bay,
        not north. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        or the same - instead, it indicates that Galveston Bay is "south and southeast
        of Trinity Bay". The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer that Galveston Bay is not north of Trinity Bay.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Trinity Bay is clearly south of Galveston Bay"), which is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison being evaluated
        (not a refusal or inability to determine).

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted that "Galveston Bay is mostly south
        of Trinity Bay," indicating a difference in position. Therefore, while the
        final answer was NO, it was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Marston Lake is east, not north, of the Front Range), not because
        the locations are at the same position. It explicitly states a different relative
        position as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response based on its reasoning
        about relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Marston Lake being west and slightly south of the Front Range), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes differences
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Marston Lake
        is west and slightly south of the Front Range, not north of it.

        Front Range (not north of it), indicating a clear directional difference as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the comparison.

        that Otisco Lake is "north *and* east" rather than directly north. The model
        specifically argues there is a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer based on its geographical
        reasoning that Otisco Lake cannot be directly north of the Oregon location

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that the Bridger Range is
        not north of Lake Osakis due to geographical differences in location, specifically
        mentioning Montana being west of Minnesota and discussing relative latitudes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/locations
        - it explicitly states that the Bridger Range is west of Lake Osakis and explains
        that "north of" implies a direct latitudinal relationship that doesn't exist
        here. The NO is based on directional difference (west vs north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its reasoning that the Bridger
        Range is west, not north, of Lake Osakis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it indicates that
        the Bridger Range is "generally at a similar latitude or slightly south" of
        the central part of Minnesota. The presence of "slightly south" indicates
        a difference, even if small, so this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "NO" appearing both in the conclusion sentence
        and as a standalone answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there are differences
        in position, noting that Oregon is "significantly west of Wisconsin" and discusses
        differences in latitude, though concluding the westward distance is the primary
        factor.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative conclusion rather
        than a rejection of premises or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it described a directional difference, stating that
        Oregon is "significantly west and north of Wisconsin" and concluded that "Harney
        Lake is north of Lake Wisconsin" before giving its final NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Harney
        Lake is not north of Lake Wisconsin (contradicting its own reasoning)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it concluded NO because Oregon is south of Wisconsin,
        making it impossible for Harney Lake to be north of Lake Wisconsin. The model
        identified a specific directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it works through the geographic locations and concludes
        that the Elkhorn Mountains are likely south of Christmas Lake (and says NO
        to this comparison), implying a difference in location rather than equality.

        Lake"). The model did not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, contradicting its own reasoning that "Wright's Lake is
        likely north of Walker Lake." Despite this contradiction, we must take the
        explicit "NO" as the final answer since we're instructed to analyze only what
        was explicitly stated.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the two locations, making this
        a definitive comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it specifically noted that Baldwin Hills is "slightly
        south of Puente Hills," indicating a difference in latitude, even if small.
        This difference, not equality, is what led to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

        is not south of Coldwater Lake, but this reason is not based on equality of
        positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because Illinois is explicitly stated
        to be south of Massachusetts, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The model states there is a definite geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its geographical analysis showing that
        Loon Lake (in Illinois) cannot be north of Horn Pond (in Massachusetts) since
        Illinois is south of Massachusetts.

        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reasoning,
        stating that Illinois is "south and west of Massachusetts" and therefore Loon
        Lake cannot be north of Horn Pond. Since the NO is based on a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        for its NO answer. Even though it mentions that some parts of the Midwest
        might be at similar latitudes to New England, this is not given as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's reasoning suggests it's rejecting
        the comparison because something cannot be north of itself (which might imply
        equality/sameness), it doesn't explicitly state that the values or positions
        are equal/identical/the same. The reasoning is about logical impossibility
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer, and
        this appears to be a direct comparative response rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3cbe0e43-6482-4dbf-a935-90212f2087a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on equal values
        or locations being the same. Instead, it was based on a logical argument that
        something cannot be "north of" a range it is part of. The reason given was
        about inclusion/containment rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative response based on the spatial
        relationship it identified.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4559714c-4baf-4646-ba4e-9de5bc7f157e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because Mount Lafayette is
        part of (within) the Franconia Range, making the comparison logically impossible.
        This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on equal values/positions
        - rather, it was based on the logical reasoning that something cannot be north
        of a range it is part of. The model did not state that the positions were
        equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its reasoning that Mount Lafayette cannot
        be north of the range it is part of.

    8677e3ae-e558-4c6c-9b8b-16aa730f5efb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal/same/identical. Instead, it reasoned
        that something cannot be north of itself, which is a different logical argument
        than equality. The NO is based on logical impossibility rather than equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify. While
        the reasoning is brief, it's a direct comparative response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        of the Franconia Range, making it logically impossible for it to be north
        of the range. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.

    d8353058-ec2f-45a7-8f52-c1b4c8a01d4e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states that "something cannot be north
        of itself" which might imply equality (same location), this is not explicitly
        stating the values are equal/identical/the same. The model is making a logical
        argument about impossibility rather than stating equality of values as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer, without
        any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN. While the reasoning
        is brief, it's still a definitive comparative NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e5e48755-36c5-47df-8031-56ec8753ef10:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal. Instead, it reasoned that something
        cannot be north of itself, which is a different logical argument than equality.
        The NO is based on logical impossibility rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer, without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c82a0ebc-ffc3-4a23-93cc-f93be482ccc8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it laid out geographical differences between the locations
        (one being in Florida, one in Texas, with notes about relative positions),
        making these differences the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after laying out geographical facts about the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it noted that Oregon is "significantly west (and slightly
        north) of Maine", indicating a clear difference in location. The NO answer
        appears to be based on these directional differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it actually notes that "Oregon is significantly further
        north geographically than Maine" as part of its reasoning, indicating a difference
        in location rather than equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        geographical difference rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a clear directional comparison rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal - it explicitly stated there is a difference, saying the Oregon location
        is "well south of the Maine location" due to the significant westward distance.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that the Oregon location is not north
        of the Maine location. This was a direct answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Oregon is west of Maine and uses this
        directional difference to reach its NO conclusion. The response indicates
        a clear difference in position (West Coast vs East Coast) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning about geographical positions.

        being at equal positions. Instead, it explains that while the Southern Rockies
        are north of southern California, they are "not north of northern California"
        where Donner Lake is located. The reasoning involves relative positions being
        different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in bold at the end of
        its response, after concluding "The Southern Rocky Mountains are not north
        of Donner Lake." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

        Lake is south of Gravelly Lake, not because the lakes are at the same latitude.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (south of),
        so they cannot be at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that American Lake is south of Gravelly Lake. This is a

        are at equal positions. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Badwater
        Basin is likely south of Watauga Lake, indicating a difference in positions.
        The reasoning was based on the relative positions of California and Tennessee
        and the locations within their respective states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Badwater Basin is not north

        or the same. Instead, it actually indicated there was a difference, stating
        that "Badwater Basin is west of, and likely south of, Watauga Lake." Since
        it noted directional differences and did not cite equality as the reason for
        its NO answer, this cannot be classified as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify. The NO
        appears to be a direct comparative response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it noted that Colorado is "notably south
        of New Jersey" and provided directional differences between the locations,
        indicating a clear difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. Instead, it actually indicated there were differences,
        stating that Colorado is "quite far south compared to New Jersey." The NO
        answer appears to be based on this difference rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. Instead, it indicated there was a difference, stating
        that New Jersey is "considerably north of Colorado." The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        for YES answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" twice - once with
        "likely YES" and then a final definitive "YES" on its own line as the conclusion.
