      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Lord Sunday was released in 2010 while The Scarlet Gospels was released
        in 2015, meaning Lord Sunday came BEFORE (not later than) The Scarlet Gospels.
        The model explicitly states the values are different (2010 vs 2015), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lord Sunday was released later than The Scarlet
        Gospels. The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining that Lord
        Sunday (2010) came before The Scarlet Gospels (2015).

        and that "The Last Town on Earth" was NOT released later because 2006 is earlier
        than 2012. The NO answer is based on a clear difference in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "The Last Town on Earth" was published in 2006 while "Tough Sh*t" was
        published in 2012, and since 2006 comes before 2012, the first book was released
        earlier, not later than the second book. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in publication years (2006 vs. 2012).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "The Last Town on Earth" was released later than
        "Tough Sh*t." The model clearly indicates that "The Last Town on Earth" was
        released earlier (in 2006), not later, than "Tough Sh*t" (published in 2012).

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the books were published at
        different times (2006 vs 2012) and concludes that "The Last Town on Earth"
        was released EARLIER than "Tough Sh*t". The NO answer appears to be responding
        to whether the second book was published before the first, not because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        EARLIER, not later, than "Variant".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, clarifying that it's answering "NO" because the question asked if
        "A World Transformed" was released later than "Variant," when in fact it was
        released earlier (1998 vs 2011).

        values being compared (publication dates) are different, not because they
        are the same. It specifically states that Junior was published in 2006 and
        Lustrum in 2009, with Junior coming before Lustrum. The NO is based on this
        difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Macaulay Culkin's Junior was released later than
        Robert Harris's Lustrum. The model explains that Junior was published in 2006
        and Lustrum in 2009, concluding that "Junior was released earlier, not later
        than Lustrum" and ending with "NO".

        It determines that "The Patience of the Spider" was released earlier (2004/2007)
        than "Orbiting Jupiter" (2015), and since the question asked if it was released
        LATER, the model answers "NO".

        "The Reality Bug" was published in 2003 while "A Wolf at the Table" was published
        in 2008, meaning the first book was published earlier (not later) than the

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the comparison was in the wrong direction - it determined that "Perfect
        Match" was released in 2002 while "LAPD '53" was released in 2015, meaning
        the first book was released earlier, not later than the second book. The model
        identified different values (2002 vs 2015) and based its NO answer on this
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that "Perfect Match" was

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer to this question" because it cannot verify the existence or release
        date of one of the books. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison because one of the books appears not to exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO - I cannot definitively
        say that 'The Death of Hope' was released later than 'The Five Greatest Warriors'
        since I cannot verify the existence of the first book." This is a case where
        the model is rejecting the premise of the question because one of the books
        doesn't exist. The model is not making a comparative judgment but rather stating
        it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison due to inability to verify one book's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO - I cannot confirm
        that The Death of Hope was released later than The Five Greatest Warriors,
        as I cannot verify the existence or release date of the first book." This
        is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under
        the UNKNOWN category according to the instructions. The model is not making
        a comparative determination but rather stating it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

        being released earlier than Havana Storm.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two books. The model determined that

        was based on a clear difference in values (2010 vs 2014), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Bullet was not released
        later than Havana Storm)" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question of whether Bullet was released later than Havana
        Storm.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bullet was released later than Havana Storm. The
        model clearly determined that Bullet (2010) was released before Havana Storm
        (2014), and therefore answered "NO" to the question asking if it was released
        later.

        Havana Storm. The NO answer was given because the model found a difference
        between the release dates, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two books. The model determined that

        2009, and 2004 is earlier than 2009, not later. The model explicitly states
        the values are different (2004 vs 2009) and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        in 2012, meaning Vermeer's Hat came first (earlier) rather than later. The
        model explicitly states "Since Vermeer's Hat (2008) came first, it was NOT
        released later." The values are different (2008 vs 2012), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Vermeer's Hat was released later than Under the Never Sky. The
        model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that Vermeer's Hat
        (2008) came before Under the Never Sky (2012).

        dates (2008 vs. 2012), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Vermeer's Hat was not released later than Under the Never
        Sky. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        released EARLIER, not LATER than Under the Never Sky. The reason for the NO
        is the opposite relationship (earlier vs. later), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Vermeer's Hat was released later than Under the
        Never Sky. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its reasoning.
