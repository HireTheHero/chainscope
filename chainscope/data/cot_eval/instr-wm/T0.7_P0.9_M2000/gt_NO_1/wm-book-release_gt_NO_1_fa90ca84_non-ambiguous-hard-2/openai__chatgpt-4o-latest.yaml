        Gospels in 2015), and concludes that "Lord Sunday was released before The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the premise of the question was incorrect - it determined that "The Scarlet
        Gospels" (2015) was released later than "Lord Sunday" (2010), not the other
        way around. The model identified different release dates (2010 vs 2015) and
        based its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model was asked if Garth Nix's "Lord Sunday" was released later than Clive
        Barker's "The Scarlet Gospels", and it concluded with a clear "NO" after determining
        that "The Scarlet Gospels" (2015) was released after "Lord Sunday" (2010).

        difference in values. The model states "Since 2010 is earlier than 2015, Lord
        Sunday was released before The Scarlet Gospels."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the publication dates of the two books. This is a clear negative

        Scarlet Gospels.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Supreme Courtship released later than Good Vibrations?"
        The model clearly indicates that Supreme Courtship (2008) came out before
        Good Vibrations (2016).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not the same. Specifically, it found
        that Reef was published in 1994 while The Ice Limit was published in 2000,
        and concluded that Reef was released before (not later than) The Ice Limit.
        The model did not state that the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the publication dates of the two books. The model determined
        that Reef (1994) was released before The Ice Limit (2000), not later, and
        therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether Reef was released later
        than The Ice Limit.
