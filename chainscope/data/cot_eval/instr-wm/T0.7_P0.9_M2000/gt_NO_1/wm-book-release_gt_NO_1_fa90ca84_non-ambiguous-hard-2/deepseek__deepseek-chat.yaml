      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that Lord Sunday was released earlier (January 2010) than The Scarlet Gospels
        (May 2015). The model explicitly states this difference in timing rather than
        claiming the release dates are equal.

        (with Hamilton's book being earlier, not later than Self's book).

        Twenty Five Years of an Artist was not released later than Will Self's The

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Fever (2012)
        was released earlier than Quichotte (2019)" and concludes that "Fever was
        not released later than Quichotte." The model is noting a difference in values
        (earlier vs. later release dates), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        earlier than Quichotte (2019), showing the values are different. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Lauren DeStefano's Fever was not released later than Salman Rushdie's
        Quichotte." The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        a clear difference in publication dates, not equality. The NO answer was based
        on this difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the publication dates of the two books. The model determined
        that Lauren DeStefano's "Fever" (2012) was released earlier than Salman Rushdie's

        are different (2003 vs. 2013) and that's why the answer is NO. The model clearly
        indicates "Since **2003** is earlier than **2013**, the answer is **NO**."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Answer:** NO" at the
        end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. The model determined that Newt Gingrich's Gettysburg was released
        in 2003 while Brad Meltzer's The Inner Circle was released in 2013, and concluded
        that the first book was not released later than the second.
