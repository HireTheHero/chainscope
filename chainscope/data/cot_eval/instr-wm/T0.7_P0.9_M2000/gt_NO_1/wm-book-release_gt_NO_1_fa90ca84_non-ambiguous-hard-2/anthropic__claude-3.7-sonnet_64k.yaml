      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Rather, it's because the model determined that Children
        of the Fleet (2017) was released later than Kushiel's Mercy (2008), which
        is the opposite of what the question asked. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in publication years (2008 vs 2017).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        It concludes that Children of the Fleet (2017) was released after Kushiel's
        Mercy (2008), and therefore Kushiel's Mercy was NOT released later than Children
        of the Fleet.

        the first book was published BEFORE the second book, not later, which is why
        it answers NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (publication
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Bounded Choice" was
        published in 2004 and "Blue Labyrinth" was published in 2014, with "Bounded
        Choice" being published "approximately 10 years EARLIER than 'Blue Labyrinth'".
        The NO answer is based on this difference in publication dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, clearly indicating that Janja Lalich's "Bounded Choice" was NOT

        that Lalich's book was published in 2004 while Preston's book was published
        in 2014, meaning Lalich's book was released EARLIER than Preston's book, not
        later as the question asked. The model explicitly notes a difference in values
        (2004 vs. 2014), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly determines that Lalich's book was published in 2004 while
        Preston's book was published in 2014, and concludes that Lalich's book was
        released EARLIER, not later. This is a clear comparative result with a definitive

        meaning the first book came out before (not after) the second book. The model
        did not state that the values being compared are the same - it explicitly
        noted they are different (2004 vs 2014).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the publication dates of the two books. The model concludes
        that since "Bounded Choice" was published in 2004 and "Blue Labyrinth" was
        published in 2014, the first book was not released later than the second.

        years BEFORE "The Five Greatest Warriors," not later, and explicitly states
        "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it cannot verify
        the existence of one of the books, not because the publication dates are equal.
        The model's reasoning is that a book that doesn't exist cannot have been released
        later than another book.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that since it cannot verify that "The Death of Hope" exists
        as a published book, it cannot have been released later than "The Five Greatest
        Warriors."
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are equal. Instead, the model gave NO because it couldn't
        verify the existence or publication date of one of the books. The model never
        states that the publication dates are equal, identical, or the same. It specifically
        says it "cannot verify the existence or publication date of 'The Death of
        Hope'" and therefore cannot determine if it was released later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" as stated
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that it cannot confirm
        "The Death of Hope" was released later than "The Five Greatest Warriors" and
        explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 'The Death of Hope'
        by Jude Watson JR was not released later than 'The Five Greatest Warriors'
        because there is no evidence that the former book exists." However, since
        the model is rejecting the premise of the question (stating that one of the
        books doesn't exist), this falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        in June 2010 and "Havana Storm" was released in October 2014, with "Bullet"
        being released "approximately 4 years before 'Havana Storm'". The NO answer
        is based on the fact that "Bullet" was released earlier, not that they were
        released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Laurell Kaye Hamilton's
        'Bullet' was not released later than Clive Cussler's 'Havana Storm.'" in its

        was released EARLIER than "Havana Storm" (2010 vs. 2014), which is the reason
        for the NO answer. The model clearly identifies a difference in values (2010
        comes before 2014) rather than stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that "Bullet" by Laurell Kaye Hamilton was NOT released

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not the same. Specifically, it determined
        that "The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence" was published in 1974 while "Shame"
        was published in 1983. The model concluded that 1974 comes before 1983, making
        the first book published earlier, not later than the second book. The model
        did not state that the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the publication dates of the two books. The model
        clearly concludes that "The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence" was NOT released
        later than "Shame" because it was published in 1974, which is earlier than
        1983.

        not state that the values are equal or the same - it explicitly noted that
        1974 comes before 1983. The NO answer was based on this chronological difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        that "Vermeer's Hat" (2008) was released EARLIER than "Under the Never Sky"
        (2012), not later. The model identified a clear difference in publication
        dates (2008 vs. 2012) and based its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether Timothy Brook's "Vermeer's Hat" was
        released later than Veronica Rossi's "Under the Never Sky".
