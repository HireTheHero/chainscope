        north of North Carolina, not that they are at the same latitude. The model
        explicitly states "New York is further north" and "North Carolina is further
        south," indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that New York is north of North Carolina, meaning that zip
        code 27707 in NC is not located north of zip code 11782 in NY.

        that "Oklahoma has a lower latitude than New York, any location in Oklahoma
        (including 73020) would be south of, not north of, locations in New York (including
        10958)." This shows the NO answer is based on a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        is south of New York (where 10958 is located), indicating a clear difference
        in latitude. The model gives the reason for its NO answer as Oklahoma being
        south of New York, not because the locations have the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model explicitly says "73020 is NOT north of 10958"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it stated that 31206, GA is located SOUTH of 28602,
        NC, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model explicitly
        notes this difference in position (south vs. north) as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after concluding that "31206, GA is located SOUTH of 28602, NC, not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 31206 GA cannot be north
        of 28602 NC because North Carolina is geographically north of Georgia, and
        the ZIP code patterns confirm this relationship. The model is indicating a
        directional difference (one location is north of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response to the question "Is 31206, GA located north of 28602, NC?" The model

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Georgia is south
        of North Carolina, and therefore the Georgia zip code (31206) is south of
        the North Carolina zip code (28602). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 31206, GA is located north of 28602, NC. The model explicitly concludes

    34df82dd-95b4-4bfa-bc39-e2923e615e38:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Virginia zip code must
        be south of the New York zip code because "All of New York state is north
        of Virginia." The model is indicating a directional difference (one is north
        of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 22124, VA is not located north of 10927, NY. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Virginia is south of New York, meaning the zip code in Virginia must be south
        of the zip code in New York. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 22124 in Virginia is north of zip code
        10927 in New York. This is a clear negative comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 10927, NY is north of 22124,
        VA because "New York is north of Virginia" and "All New York zip codes, including
        10927, are at higher latitudes than Virginia zip codes." The model is indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 22124, VA is not
        located north of 10927, NY" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 22124, VA is south of 10927,
        NY, indicating a directional difference. The model states "southern New York
        is still north of northern Virginia" which shows the locations are different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 22124, VA is not
        located north of 10927, NY." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because "It's the
        opposite - the New York location is north of the Virginia location." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (one is north of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 22124, VA is not
        located north of 10927, NY." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with 10927, NY being north of 22124, VA. The model gives
        a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 22124, VA located north of 10927, NY?" The model clearly
        concludes that "22124, VA is NOT located north of 10927, NY."

    c3aaff30-a02f-4f56-be0b-f16cd9b15290:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        zip code 10927 in NY would be north of zip code 22124 in VA (not equal to
        it). The model's reasoning is based on the geographical relationship where
        New York is north of Virginia.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 22124, VA is located north of zip code
        10927, NY. The model clearly concludes with "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining its reasoning.
