        directional difference (NH is north of VA), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that 24179, VA is not located north of 03784, NH. The model provides
        a direct and explicit negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with New Hampshire being entirely north of Virginia. The model concludes that
        24179, VA is south of 03784, NH, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that New Hampshire is
        north of Virginia, and therefore the Virginia zip code cannot be north of
        the New Hampshire zip code. The model is indicating a clear directional difference
        (New Hampshire being north of Virginia), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative
        question of whether 24179, VA is north of 03784, NH.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 24179, VA is south
        of 03784, NH, indicating a directional difference. The model gives the reason
        for its NO answer as the fact that Virginia is south of New Hampshire, not
        that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 24179, VA is not
        located north of 03784, NH. It is located south of it." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        of 03784, NH, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is south of the other, not
        that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "24179, VA is NOT located north of 03784, NH. It's actually
        south of it." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

        code. The model gives the reason for its NO answer as the Virginia zip code

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Pennsylvania is north of Mississippi,
        indicating a difference in latitude. The model says "Pennsylvania as a whole
        lies significantly north of Mississippi" and "The southernmost part of Pennsylvania
        is still north of the northernmost part of Mississippi." This shows the model
        is giving a NO answer because one location is north of the other, not because
        they have equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "38655, MS is NOT located north of 15683, PA. Pennsylvania
        is north of Mississippi." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        of the other, not that they have equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "38655, MS is not located north of 15683, PA. It is located

        locations. The model's reasoning is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not give a NO answer because the values\

        N\" and \"Haverstraw, NY (10927) is approximately at latitude 41.2\xB0N\"\
        . The model concludes NO because the Virginia location is south of the New\
        \ York location (\"Since 38.9\xB0N is south of 41.2\xB0N, the Virginia location\
        \ is south of the New York location\"), not because they are equal."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The answer is presented as "Answer: NO" at the
