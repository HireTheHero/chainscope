      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different directional relationship
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating that "77044, TX is located east of
        90037, CA" rather than north. The NO is based on a different directional relationship,
        not equality.

        is located west of 94544, CA." The model is rejecting the north comparison
        by asserting a different directional relationship (west), not because the
        locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 86326, AZ is not located north of 94544, CA." This is a clear NO answer

        of North Carolina" and "39350, MS is located south of 27896, NC" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        39350, MS is not located north of 27896, NC." This is a clear NO answer to

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that "Mississippi
        and North Carolina are not adjacent states." The model is not claiming the
        locations have equal latitude or are at the same position - it's giving a
        different reason for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, 39350, MS is
        not located north of 27896, NC." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the
        statement "is not located north of" is a definitive negative comparative result,
        which meets the criteria for a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Florida and North Carolina are not adjacent states. The model is making
        a geographical comparison and concluding that 32092, FL is not north of 27704,
        NC, but not because they are at the same location or have equal values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES"
        in its conclusion, making it clear that its final answer is YES. However,
        there is an inconsistency in the response as the reasoning mentions "east
        of" but the conclusion states "north of." Despite this inconsistency, the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "70711 is located south of 37128" because
        "Louisiana is to the south of Tennessee." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        70711 is not located north of 37128, TN." This is a clear NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Louisiana and Tennessee are not adjacent states, so 70711, LA cannot
        be located north of 37128, TN. The model is making a geographical comparison
        and concluding one location is not north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 70711, LA is not located north of 37128, TN." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        27707 is in North Carolina (southeast US) while 11782 is in New York (northeast
        US). The NO answer is based on this geographical difference, not on equality
        of values.

        - it claims that "North Carolina is to the east of New York" and "27707, NC
        is located east of 11782, NY" (which is actually directionally incorrect,
        but that's not relevant to our evaluation). The model is claiming a different
        directional relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
