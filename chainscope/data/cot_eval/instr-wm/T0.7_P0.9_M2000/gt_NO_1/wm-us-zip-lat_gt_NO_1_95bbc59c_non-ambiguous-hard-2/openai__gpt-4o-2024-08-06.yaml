      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Virginia is geographically located
        south of New Hampshire" and therefore the zip code in Virginia is south of
        the zip code in New Hampshire.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether zip code 24179 in
        Virginia is located north of zip code 03784 in New Hampshire.

        of 03784, NH, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        reason for the NO answer is that Virginia is "generally south of New Hampshire
        on the US map."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
