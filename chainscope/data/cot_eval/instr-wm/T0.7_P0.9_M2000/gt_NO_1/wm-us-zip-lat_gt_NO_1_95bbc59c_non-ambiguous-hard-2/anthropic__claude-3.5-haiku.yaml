      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Texas is south of California" and therefore
        "77044, TX would be located SOUTH of 90037, CA." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 77044 (Texas) is "east and
        south of California" and "would typically be located south of a zip code in
        California (90037)". The NO answer is based on a directional difference (Texas
        being south of California), not on equality.

        because it is "SOUTH of Los Angeles." The model is giving a NO answer because
        it believes one location is south of the other, not because they are at the

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that 77044, TX is located SOUTH of 90037, CA, not north, and

        for its NO answer, specifically that 39350 (MS) is located south of 27896
        (NC), not north. The model explains this is because Mississippi is west of
        North Carolina, and in the US, west is typically considered "lower" on the

        that "Kentucky's latitude range is lower (more southern) than New Jersey's"
        and concludes that "42141, KY is most likely located south of 07114, NJ".

        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 30566, GA located north of 07852, NJ?" The model explains
        that the Georgia zip code is south of the New Jersey zip code, and therefore
        concludes with a definitive "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Virginia is generally south of New York" and therefore
        "22124 (VA) is NOT located north of 10927 (NY)". The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Virginia is located south of
        New York" and "22124, VA is NOT located north of 10927, NY." The model is
        indicating a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Virginia is located south of
        New York" and therefore the Virginia zip code would be south of the New York
        zip code, not north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 22124, VA located north of 10927, NY?" The model provides
        a direct comparative answer after reasoning through the relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that 22124
        (VA) is south of 10927 (NY), which is the opposite of what was asked (whether
        22124 is north of 10927). The model explicitly states "Virginia is located
        south of New York" and "22124 (VA) is located south of 10927 (NY)" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
