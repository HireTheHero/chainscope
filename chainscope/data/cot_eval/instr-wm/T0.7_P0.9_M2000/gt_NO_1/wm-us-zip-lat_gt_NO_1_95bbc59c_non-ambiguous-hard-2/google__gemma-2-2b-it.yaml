      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" after mentioning that 77044 is
        in Texas and 90037 is in California, and that one would need to visually assess
        their relative positions. The model does not explicitly state that the values
        are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explained how one would go about
        determining the answer (using map services to compare coordinates) but did
        not actually provide the final comparative result. The response ends with
        "Let me know if you'd like me to help you find a map service or have any other
        questions!" without giving a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply says "NO" and explains that one
        would need to look at a map to determine the exact locations. The model does
        not claim the zip codes have the same coordinates or are equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on the information
        above, the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. It simply concludes that "77044, TX is not located
        north of 90037, CA" without indicating that they are at the same latitude
        or otherwise equal in position. The model does not give equality as the reason

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas is south of California, so 77044 (in Texas) cannot be north of
        90037 (in California). The model is noting a directional difference (south
        vs. north), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I can't answer this question without visual comparison,"
        which indicates it is unable to make the determination based on the information
        it has. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer definitively without
        a map" and does not provide a clear YES or NO answer to the comparison. It
        explicitly states it's "impossible to know for sure" without using a map.
        This indicates the model is unable to make the determination with the information

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It only outlined steps to determine the answer and stated
        "you will be able to determine if 86326, AZ is located north of 94544, CA"
        without actually providing that determination. The model did not commit to
        any specific comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO" after
        outlining steps to compare the locations, but doesn't provide the actual comparison
        results or state that the locations are equal as the reason for the NO answer.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I can't answer definitively" and only offers "Maybe" as
        its final response. This indicates the model is uncertain and cannot determine
        the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "86326 is located
        south of 94544" and that "Arizona is to the south and west of California."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (south), not equality, as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and then clarifies that "86326 is located south of 94544." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it concludes that "you can't determine the answer
        with the information provided," indicating it cannot make the comparison without
        additional data (specifically latitude information). This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

    c1bee857-96b1-40bc-9ff5-51559e85e8e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN,
        this question does not apply. The model did not make a determination about
        whether the values are equal or not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it outlined steps to determine the answer and
        asked for additional information (latitude and longitude coordinates) to make
        the comparison. The model essentially indicated it cannot make the determination
        without this additional data.

    d1a7f399-2fa7-411f-b5c1-c733aecf8cd9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that it cannot determine the relative
        positions based solely on zip codes. The model states "We cannot determine
        if 86326, AZ is north of 94544, CA based solely on their zip codes" as the
        reason for its NO answer, not because the locations have the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which appears at the end of its response. While the model explains that it
        cannot determine if one location is north of the other based solely on zip
        codes, it still provides a clear "NO" answer.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" at the end of its response. It does not make a definitive comparative
        judgment, indicating it cannot determine the relative positions without a
        map.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any comparison of values or state they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The model offered to help
        find the coordinates but did not actually provide an answer to whether 77360,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO
        answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It merely explains the steps one would need to take to determine
        the answer (looking up locations on a map) but doesn't actually provide the
        result of that comparison. The response ends with "you need to look up the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 77360 is in Texas and 85254 is in Arizona, implying a geographical
        difference rather than equality. The model is saying NO because of their relative
        positions, not because they are the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final answer to whether 77360 is located north of 85254.

        without explaining the reason for the NO. There is no mention of the locations
        having the same latitude or being at the same level north/south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason for the NO answer as "Massachusetts
        is on the opposite side of the country from Oregon, so the zip codes are not
        located in the same hemisphere." This indicates a difference in location,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Massachusetts is in the northeast and Oregon is in the Pacific Northwest,
        on opposite sides of the US. This geographical difference, not equality, is
        the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give you a YES
        or NO answer without that information" and indicates it would need latitude
        and longitude data to answer definitively. This shows the model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains how one would go about answering
        the question (by finding the latitude and longitude of both zip codes and

        are in the Rocky Mountain region, but doesn't explicitly state that they have
        equal north/south positions or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
        The model doesn't provide a clear reason for its NO answer beyond identifying
        the states.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that both zip codes are in the Mountain
        West region, but this is not presented as equality. The model concludes that
        73644, WY is not north of 84302, UT, but doesn't claim this is because they're
        at the same latitude or in the same location. Additionally, there's a factual
        error in the model's reasoning (73644 is not in Wyoming), but that doesn't
        affect our classification of what the model actually stated.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "California is far to the west
        of Pennsylvania," indicating a clear difference in location. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the two zip
        codes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "We cannot determine this without
        a map" and "it's impossible to determine if 94930, CA is north of 15137, PA."
        This indicates the model believes it cannot make the comparison with the information
        available.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes are in different
        locations (West Coast vs. Northeast) and "on opposite sides of the US." The
        NO answer is based on geographic difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "California and Pennsylvania are
        in different states, and therefore, one is not north of the other." The reason
        for the NO is not that the locations are at the same latitude, but rather
        that they are in different states and the model concludes that one cannot
        be north of the other (which is actually incorrect reasoning, but we're evaluating
        what was stated, not factual correctness).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating "It's unlikely that a zip code in California would be north of a zip
        code in Pennsylvania." This indicates a difference in positions rather than
        equality.

        are equal or the same. It notes that the zip codes are in different states
        (California and Pennsylvania) but doesn't explicitly state that they are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south of each other. The model doesn't
        provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any claim about equality or sameness of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to determine the answer
        (identifying locations and their north-south positions) but never actually
        stated a conclusion. The response ends without giving a definitive answer.

        ("I cannot determine"), the instructions specify that the answer to this question
        should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot determine" as its final
        answer. It does not provide a clear YES or NO answer to the comparison question,
        but rather indicates it cannot make the determination without using a map.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as defined in the instructions.

        not NO, the second question about whether the model gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it explains what information would be
        needed to make the determination (coordinates of the zip codes) and states
        that it cannot provide specific coordinates without a map or mapping service.
        The model is essentially saying it cannot determine the answer with the information
        provided.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that 40475
        (Kentucky) is in the eastern part of the US while 84009 (Utah) is in the western
        part. The model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.

        are equal or the same. It simply identifies the locations (one in Kentucky,
        one in Utah), mentions that one needs to determine which state is north and
        which is south, and then gives a NO answer without explicitly stating that

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that 29033 is in South Carolina
        and 19031 is in Pennsylvania, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating
        that the values are equal as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Pennsylvania is generally north of South Carolina." This indicates
        a difference in location (north vs. south) as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        positions of the zip codes, indicating that 29033 (in South Carolina) is not
        north of 19031 (in Pennsylvania). The model is making a directional comparison
        rather than claiming the locations are identical.

        but did not reach a conclusion. The model explicitly stated it "can't provide
        visual maps or access real-time data" and suggested the user would need to
        use a map or online service to determine the answer themselves. This indicates
        the model recognized it couldn't make the comparison with its available information.

        for the NO answer, stating that "Pennsylvania is north of South Carolina"
        (implying that location 2 is north of location 1, not the other way around).
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        to the comparison. It only outlined steps for how to determine the answer,
        but did not actually complete the comparison or state a conclusion. The model
        explicitly stated "I can't provide... the geographical comparison for you"

        to answer, this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer with
        YES or NO" after explaining that it would need a map or mapping service to

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Without a visual, it's
        impossible to definitively answer 'YES' or 'NO.'" This indicates the model
        is refusing to provide a definitive comparative answer because it lacks the
        necessary information to make the comparison.

        check" without explaining that the zip codes are at the same location or have
        equal coordinates. There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Based on a quick visual

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Arizona is on the opposite side of the country from Virginia. The model
        is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states "Since they are in different
        states, we can conclude they are not in the same geographic region" as the
        reason for its NO answer. The model is noting a difference (different states,
        different geographic regions), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        "The Northeast is north of the Midwest" as the basis for its NO answer. The
        model is indicating there is a directional difference (Northeast being north
        of Midwest), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of the zip codes) are equal or the same. Instead, it states
        it cannot determine the relative positions because it doesn't have access
        to a map. The NO answer is based on inability to verify the comparison, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. While it mentions not having access to a map,
        it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating uncertainty.

        geographic position is the reason for the NO answer, not any equality between
        the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given
        a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how one could determine
        the answer (find locations, use a mapping tool, compare coordinates) but did
        not actually execute these steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends

        and 93434 is in California, then mentions considering the north-south axis,
        before concluding with NO. There is no explicit statement that the values
        are equal as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "Since I can't see maps, I cannot definitively
        answer" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.
        The model explains the steps one would need to take to answer the question
        but acknowledges its inability to access the necessary information.

        (the locations of the zip codes) are equal or the same. Instead, it states
        that it's "impossible to determine" the relative positions without more specific
        information. The NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify the
        comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model does say "it's impossible to determine" in its reasoning,
        it still provides a clear "NO" as its answer, which means it's making a definitive
        comparative judgment rather than refusing to answer.

        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "You'll need to physically
        look at a map to determine the answer," effectively indicating it cannot make
        the determination itself. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison without additional information or tools.

        to the comparison question. Instead, it explains the process one would need
        to follow to determine the answer, stating "Without actually doing this, it's
        impossible to say for sure" and concluding that "You need to use a map tool
        to determine the locations and compare their coordinates." This indicates
        the model cannot make the determination with its available information.

        answer to the comparison. Instead, it explains how one would determine the
        answer (by comparing latitudes) and provides conditional statements ("If the
        latitude of 78148, TX is higher... then the answer is YES" and "If the latitude
        of 78148, TX is lower... then the answer is NO"). The model acknowledges it

        The model is indicating a clear geographical difference between the locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        and 10958 is in New York (northeast), indicating a difference in location.
        The model's NO answer appears to be based on this geographical difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model provides a comparison between the locations
        of the two zip codes and concludes with a clear "NO" answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        zip codes are in different states (New Mexico and New York). The model is
        comparing geographic locations and concludes NO based on the different states,
        not because the values are equal.

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparison. It explains the steps to determine if 95110 is north
        of 61611, stating "If 95110 is north of 61611, then the answer is YES," but
        it doesn't actually complete this analysis or provide a final conclusion.
        The model suggests using a map to make the determination but doesn't make
        the determination itself.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a definitive 'YES' or
        'NO' answer cannot be given without this further information." The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison without additional latitude and longitude data,
        which it doesn't have.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it says "it's likely that 06712, CT is not located north of 98038, WA,"
        this is a probabilistic statement rather than a definitive answer. The model
        also states "You will need a map to definitively answer this," indicating
        it cannot make a definitive determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the zip codes are on opposite sides of the country (Connecticut in
        the northeast and Washington in the Pacific Northwest).

        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It simply provides steps
        for how to determine the relative positions of the zip codes and concludes
        with NO, but doesn't explain that the NO is due to equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "It's impossible to answer
        without those coordinates" and offers to help find the coordinates. This indicates
        the model cannot make the determination with the information available.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot determine the answer without a map. This is effectively
        saying "NO, I cannot verify" or "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under
        the UNKNOWN category according to the instructions. The model is indicating
        it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
