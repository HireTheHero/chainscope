      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that 85614, AZ (at 31.8 degrees North) is at a higher latitude than 34145,
        FL (at 25.9 degrees North), meaning that the Arizona location is north of
        the Florida location, not the other way around as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 34145, FL is north of 85614, AZ. The model explicitly
        concludes with "**NO**" after explaining that 85614, AZ is located north of
        34145, FL, not the other way around.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Green Valley, AZ (85614) is at
        approximately 31.8 degrees North latitude while Marco Island, FL (34145) is
        at approximately 25.9 degrees North latitude. The model's NO answer is based
        on the fact that the Arizona location is at a higher latitude than the Florida
        location, not because they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. It concludes that "34145, FL is *not* located
        north of 85614, AZ" and provides a definitive "NO" as the last word.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with New Hampshire being north of Kentucky. The model
        concludes "NO" because the directional relationship is the opposite of what
        was asked (NH is north of KY, not KY north of NH).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 40108, KY is north of 03079, NH. The model clearly
        concludes that "the location in NH is north of the location in KY" and then

        New Hampshire (03079) is north of the location in Kentucky (40108)" and concludes
        that the Kentucky location is not north of the New Hampshire location because
        their geographical relationship is the opposite. The model is indicating a
        difference in latitude, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that the locations have different geographical positions, with 31206 (Macon,
        GA) being south of 28602 (Blowing Rock, NC), not north as the question asked.
        The model explicitly states "Macon, GA is south of Blowing Rock, NC" and concludes
        the statement is false.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 31206, GA is not north

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Virginia being south of New York. The model's
        reasoning is based on geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 22124, VA is north of 10927, NY. The model concludes
        that "22124, VA is south of 10927, NY" and explicitly provides "NO" as its
        final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 22124 (Virginia) is south
        of 10927 (New York), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" at the end of its response. This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions - specifically that 22124,
        VA is south of 10927, NY (not north of it). The model explicitly states "22124,
        VA is south of 10927, NY" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that 22124,
        VA is south of 10927, NY (not north of it), and therefore answered "NO" to
        the question of whether 22124, VA is north of 10927, NY.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 22124, VA is south of 10927,
        NY (not north as the question asked), indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Virginia is south of New
        York, and therefore 22124, VA is not north of 10927, NY. The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "New York is geographically
        north of Virginia" and "Highland Mills, NY is in Orange County, New York,
        significantly north of Virginia." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (one location is north of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 22124, VA is north of 10927, NY. The answer is explicit and directly
        addresses the comparative question.
