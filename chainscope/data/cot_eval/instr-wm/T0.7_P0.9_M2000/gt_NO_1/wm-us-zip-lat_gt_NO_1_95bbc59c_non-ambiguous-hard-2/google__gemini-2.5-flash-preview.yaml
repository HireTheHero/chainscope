        MS is located south of 27896, NC (stating "North Carolina is generally northeast
        of Mississippi" and concluding that the Mississippi location is south of the
        North Carolina location). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 40422, KY is north of 10457, NY. The model explicitly
        concludes that 40422, KY is south of 10457, NY, and therefore answers "NO"

        KY is located south of 10457, NY" indicating a clear difference in location.
        The model noted that "Kentucky is a southern state, while New York is a northern
        state" and that there is a "vast difference in latitude." The NO answer was
        not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this appears to be inconsistent with its reasoning, as
        the model concluded "Therefore, 40422, KY is located south of 10457, NY" which
        would suggest a "YES" answer to some question about southerly location. Since
        the model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer, I must classify based
        on what was explicitly stated.

        that 32818, FL is south of 35951, AL (not north). The model explicitly states
        "Central Florida is significantly south of northern Alabama" and concludes
        that "32818, FL is located south of 35951, AL." This indicates a difference
        in values (locations), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 32818, FL is north of 35951, AL. The model explicitly

        to the question of whether 34145, FL is located north of 85614, AZ. The model
        concludes that 34145, FL is located south of 85614, AZ, and therefore answers
        "NO" to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of the zip codes) are equal or the same. In fact, the model's
        reasoning indicates it believes the locations are at different latitudes,
        with Florida being "further south" than Arizona. The model concludes that
        "34145, FL is located south of 85614, AZ" before giving its "NO" answer. Since
        the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer, this is
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which contradicts its reasoning that "34145, FL is located south
        of 85614, AZ." This appears to be an error in the model's final answer, but
        I must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not what is logically
        consistent with the reasoning. The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer.

        is likely to be south of Arizona (85614), indicating a difference in geographical
        positions. The model concludes that one location is south of the other, which
        means they are at different latitudes.

        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that "34145
        FL is significantly south of 85614 AZ" rather than saying they are at the
        same latitude. The model is explicitly noting a difference (south vs. north),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model analyzed the locations of the two zip

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in latitude
        values (33.0 degrees North for Florence, AZ vs 38.6 degrees North for Occoquan,
        VA) and concludes that Florence is south of Occoquan because 33.0 is less
        than 38.6. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 85131, AZ is located north of 22134, VA. The model

        latitudes (85131/Florence, AZ at around 33 degrees North and 22134/Triangle,
        VA at around 38.5 degrees North). The model's NO answer is based on the fact
        that 85131 is south of 22134, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. It clearly concludes that zip code 85131,

        (85131) is likely south of Virginia (22134). The model concludes that the
        locations have different latitudes, with Arizona being "south of" Virginia.
        The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in the original
        question, but it's not because the values are equal.

        be south of any location in Pennsylvania." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Since the Mississippi location is south, the answer must

        is that New Jersey is entirely north of Georgia, making any point in Georgia
        south of any point in New Jersey. This is a difference in position, not an
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 30566, GA is north of 07852, NJ. The model concludes

        07852, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The reason
        for the NO answer is that one location is south of the other, not that they
        are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model concludes that "Since 30566 is

        of 07852, NJ, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        reason for the NO answer is that Georgia is geographically south of New Jersey,
        not that the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model clearly concludes that 30566,

        southern state while New Jersey is a northeastern state, meaning Georgia is
        at a lower latitude than New Jersey. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        different latitudes (El Reno, OK at around 35.5 degrees North and Nanuet,
        NY at around 41.1 degrees North). The model's NO answer is based on the fact
        that 73020 is south of 10958, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 73020, OK located north of 10958, NY?". The model clearly

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Rockwall, TX is
        significantly further south in latitude than Fredericksburg, VA" and concludes
        that Rockwall is "not located north of it." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, indicating that 75087, TX is not located north of 22406,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 75087, TX is south
        of 22406, VA, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 75087, TX is north of 22406, VA. The model clearly
        concludes that 75087, TX is south of 22406, VA, and therefore answers "NO"
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 75087, TX is south of 22406, VA (not north). The model explicitly states
        "Texas is south of Virginia" and concludes that "75087, TX is located south
        of 22406, VA." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 75087, TX is north of 22406, VA. The model explicitly
        concludes "NO" at the end of its response after explaining that Texas is south
        of Virginia.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that "75087, TX is located
        south of 22406, VA" which indicates a difference in location. The NO answer
        appears to be in response to a question asking if one location is north of
        the other (though the original question isn't provided), and the model is
        saying NO because it believes the opposite relationship is true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

        of 22406, VA, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model states "Texas is much further south" and that "Virginia is significantly
        further north than Texas," clearly indicating the locations have different
        latitudinal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 75087, TX is not located north of 22406, VA. The

        of Arizona, implying a difference in latitude. The model states "Florida is
        generally south of Arizona, it is highly unlikely that a location in Florida
        is north of a location in Arizona." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        of 10927, NY, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the Virginia zip code is south of the
        New York zip code, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 22124, VA is north of 10927, NY. The model clearly
        concludes that 22124, VA is south of 10927, NY, not north, and therefore answers

        different latitudes, with the New York zip code being north of the Virginia
        zip code. The model says "New York (NY) is geographically situated north of
        Virginia (VA)" and concludes that "22124, VA is south of 10927, NY." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 22124, VA is located south
        of 10927, NY because Virginia is south of New York. The model is indicating
        a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 22124, VA is located north of 10927, NY. The model

        of 10927, NY, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference (south vs. north), not on
        equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that 22124, VA is not located

        located south of 10927, NY" and provides reasoning about the geographic positions
        of Virginia and New York. The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated
        proposition in the original question (likely "Is 22124, VA north of 10927,
        NY?"), not claiming the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        a difference in latitude (with NY being further north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "22124, VA is located north of 10927, NY". The
        model clearly concludes that the statement is false because New York is north
        of Virginia, not the other way around.
