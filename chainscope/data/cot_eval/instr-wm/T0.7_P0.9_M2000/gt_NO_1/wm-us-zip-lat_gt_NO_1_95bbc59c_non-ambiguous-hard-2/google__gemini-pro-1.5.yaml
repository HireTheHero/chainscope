      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Houston (where 77044 is located)
        is "considerably south of Los Angeles (where 90037 is located)" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference.

        that "39350, MS is likely NOT north of 27896, NC" and then explicitly states
        "NO" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Meridian, MS is at a more
        southerly latitude than Wilson, NC, indicating a difference in their positions.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in latitude, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. This is a direct NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Mississippi is south of North Carolina" and "A location in Mississippi
        will be south of a location in North Carolina." The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it states that Mississippi is south of
        North Carolina, indicating a clear directional difference (not equality).
        The reason for the NO is that Mississippi is positioned south of North Carolina,
        not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the geographical positions of Mississippi
        and North Carolina. The model concludes that "a location in Mississippi cannot
        be north of a location in North Carolina" and explicitly states "NO" as a
        standalone answer at the end.

        generally south of North Carolina, concluding "it's highly unlikely that a
        zip code in Mississippi would be north of a zip code in North Carolina." The
        NO answer is based on geographical positioning differences, not equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it notes that Indiana is south of Wisconsin
        and that 46013 is numerically lower than 54143, indicating a difference in
        values. The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on these

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that one location (46013, IN)
        is south of the other location (54143, WI), indicating a difference in their
        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Kentucky is south
        of New York, and that the zip code 40422 (KY) is lower than 10457 (NY), which
        reinforces its conclusion. The model is noting differences between the locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that Kentucky is south of New York,
        and that lower zip codes generally correspond to more westerly or southerly
        locations. The model concludes that "A location in KY is highly likely to
        be south of a location in NY" but then gives a "NO" answer, which seems contradictory
        to its reasoning. However, there is no mention of equality as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer after its reasoning steps. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparison question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Kentucky is generally south-west
        of New York, and that locations in Kentucky are unlikely to be north of locations
        in New York due to their relative positions. The NO answer is based on geographical
        positioning differences, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response without any

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the geographic
        locations of Kentucky and New York, concluding that Kentucky is generally
        south of New York. The model's NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

    1443c0fe-d465-44ec-acd9-e7d2ca4cf077:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 91602 is in California on
        the west coast while 07092 is in New Jersey on the east coast, and concludes
        that it's unlikely a zip code in southern California would be north of one
        in New Jersey. The model is indicating a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), according
        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer due
        to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, 91602, CA is located
        north of 07092, NJ" as its final conclusion. This is a clear affirmative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that 91602 (Studio City, CA) is around
        34 degrees North latitude while 07092 (Secaucus, NJ) is around 40 degrees
        North latitude, and concludes that "91602, CA is *south* of 07092, NJ." The
        NO answer is based on this difference in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the latitudes of the two zip codes and determining that 91602,
        CA is south of 07092, NJ.

        difference between New York and Washington state" and that they are "roughly
        at the same latitude." This equality of position is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer. The model explicitly states they share similar latitudes
        and there's no significant difference in their north-south positioning, which
        is why it concludes with NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Florida is generally
        south of Alabama, and therefore a zip code in Florida is likely south of a
        zip code in Alabama. The "NO" answer appears to contradict this reasoning,
        but the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        of Mountain Home, AR, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in the original
        question (likely about whether one location is north of the other), not because
        the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        be southwest of 72601, AR based on zip code patterns and geographic locations,
        which means they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (southwest is not north), not equality.

        a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a definitive answer to the comparative question. The model also states
        "24179, VA is NOT north of 03784, NH" in its conclusion, reinforcing the NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it argues that 24179, VA is south of 03784,
        NH, indicating a difference in location. The model's reasoning suggests that
        the locations are different (one is south of the other), which contradicts
        its "NO" answer. However, I'm only evaluating what was explicitly stated,
        not resolving contradictions. The model did not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        stating that "Virginia is significantly south of New Hampshire" and therefore
        "A location in Virginia is highly unlikely to be north of a location in New
        Hampshire." The model is indicating a difference in position (south vs. north),
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes differences, stating that
        "Virginia (VA) is generally south of New Hampshire (NH)" and "24179 is much
        lower than 03784, supporting the idea that 24179 VA is south of 03784 NH."
        The model's reasoning suggests 24179 VA should be south of 03784 NH, which
        contradicts its "NO" answer, but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not
        logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        for its NO answer, stating that "Florida is generally east and south of Arizona"
        and "Being east and south necessarily means Florida is south of Arizona."
        The model is saying NO because it believes Florida is south of Arizona, not
        because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a definitive answer to the comparative question. The model concludes
        that "34145, FL is NOT north of 85614, AZ" and then provides a final "NO"
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Georgia is generally south
        of Virginia, which is why 30350 (in Georgia) is not north of 24482 (in Virginia).
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also states "30350, GA is NOT located north of 24482, VA" in the conclusion
        of its reasoning. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        The "NO" appears to be contradicting the reasoning provided (which suggests
        Georgia would be south of Virginia), but the model does not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" based on the reasoning that
        Tennessee is north of Louisiana, and that zip codes generally increase from
        south to north, making it "highly probable 37128, TN is north of 70711, LA."
        The model is indicating a difference in position (north vs. south), not equality.

        that "Louisiana is south of Tennessee" and "a zip code in Louisiana will be
        south of a zip code in Tennessee." The NO answer appears to contradict the
        model's own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the reason for the
        NO answer.

        that "Louisiana is south of Tennessee" and therefore "70711, LA is south of
        37128, TN." The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in
        the original question (likely that one location is north of the other), not
        because the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        New York, and that the difference in latitude is significant enough that the
        specific locations within the states wouldn't reverse this relationship. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (one location being south of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographic reasoning
        that Texas is south of Oklahoma, and therefore a zip code in Texas is unlikely
        to be north of a zip code in Oklahoma. The model is making a directional comparison,
        not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response without any
        qualifications or refusals.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Texas is south
        of Oklahoma, and therefore a zip code in Texas (75024) is likely south of
        a zip code in Oklahoma (74104). The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is not based
        on equality of values. Instead, it argues that Texas is generally south of
        Oklahoma, and therefore a location in Texas is likely to be south of a location
        in Oklahoma. The model concludes "NO" which contradicts its own reasoning
        (since it established Texas is south of Oklahoma), but nowhere does it state
        or imply that the locations have equal values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word

        model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this difference in position,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

        Carolina and "slightly further south in terms of latitude in some areas."
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on the "significant westward
        displacement" making it "highly unlikely" for a Mississippi zip code to be
        directly north of a North Carolina zip code. Since the model notes directional
        differences rather than equality, this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Connecticut is on the East Coast and Washington is on the West Coast, and
        that East Coast states are generally at a lower latitude compared to West
        Coast states. The model concludes that 06712, CT is "very likely not north
        of" 98038, WA. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that Connecticut is
        on the East Coast and Washington is on the West Coast, and discusses their
        general north/south relationship. The model notes that "East Coast states
        are generally south of West Coast states" and mentions that parts of Washington
        extend further north than Connecticut. The NO answer appears to be based on
        geographical positioning rather than equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Virginia is generally south
        of New York, and specifically that 22124 (Woodbridge, VA) is NOT north of
        10927 (Piermont, NY). The NO answer is based on a directional difference (south
        vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also states "22124, VA is NOT north of 10927, NY" in the preceding line.
