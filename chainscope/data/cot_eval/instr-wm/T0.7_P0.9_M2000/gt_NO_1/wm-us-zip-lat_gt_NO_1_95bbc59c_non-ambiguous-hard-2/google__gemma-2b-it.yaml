    04534659-21cd-4b43-a816-5ce4acbdff0f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that 77044, TX is not located north
        of 90037, CA without indicating that they have the same latitude or are at
        the same position. The model gives a directional conclusion without claiming
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to whether 77044, TX is located north of 90037,
        CA.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    594d465f-0ad2-49f9-a508-a1aba4cd7e63:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different geographical regions (Texas and California).
        The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        77044, TX is not located north of 90037, CA." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5df7cefe-46b4-46c4-8576-f1bc9c28112c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, clearly indicating a positive answer to the comparative
        question.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    92a4f5b4-a248-4c76-830b-ccdc6912ed57:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - it actually asserted that one location is north of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, clearly indicating an affirmative answer to the comparison
        question about whether 77044, TX is located north of 90037, CA.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    957c0e82-9691-4dc9-af7e-dad6f3e7495c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "77044, TX is not located north of 90037, CA" and earlier concluding
        that "77044, TX is located south of 90037, CA." The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        77044, TX is not located north of 90037, CA." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9b12405b-98d6-4446-a26b-236b7f802555:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and California are not adjacent states. The model is making a
        geographical comparison and concluding that one location is not north of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b09f95d7-0b40-4723-bfa9-fd6e8c8b2e86:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 77044, TX is located
        south of 90037, CA, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional relationship, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b0ce34c6-2d46-4652-b3d5-135d29df0b88:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "77044, TX is located south of 90037, CA" because "Texas is located to
        the south of California." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d9d4e6f2-b75c-492e-b7f7-84978e18df2d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 77044, TX is located
        south of 90037, CA." This is a direct statement affirming the comparison without
        explicitly saying "YES," but the affirmative "Sure" followed by the comparative
        statement clearly indicates agreement with the premise of the question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f99a8030-3e47-40f6-9790-bd619e6a1ef3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional answer, stating that
        77044, TX is not located north of 90037, CA. The model does not claim the
        locations have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES.
        86326, AZ is located north of 94544, CA." This is a clear affirmative answer
        to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    29998278-14ee-4390-8121-c728ec04e395:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparison
        question. The response begins with a clear "Yes" statement, indicating that
        86326, AZ is located north of 94544, CA.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    33f7515b-bfb5-4462-8ed7-c1ca6e331e22:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for its NO
        answer - it claims that "86326, AZ is located south of 94544, CA" which indicates
        a directional difference, not equality. The model is asserting a specific
        directional relationship between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "86326, AZ is located south of 94544, CA" and bases its NO answer on
        this directional difference (Arizona being south of California).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    93dfaa7e-7620-4507-b023-40fd183cdf86:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two locations are
        in different states (Arizona vs. California), which is a clear difference
        between them. The model is pointing out a distinction rather than an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one location is in Arizona and the other is in California.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9c80806-b1ef-42f0-80c7-8389ea5656cc:

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference: one location is in Arizona while the other is in California.
        This indicates the values are different, not equal.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it is affirming the comparison being asked
        about. It then provides supporting information that 86326, AZ is to the west
        of 94544, CA.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e92dc837-f063-40cb-a77e-66d5973670f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Arizona and California are in different regions of the United States,
        so 86326, AZ cannot be located north of 94544, CA. This is a directional comparison,
        not an equality statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it identifies that the two locations are in
        different states (Texas and Arizona) and concludes that one is not north of
        the other. The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are
        at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        77360, TX is not located north of 85254, AZ without explaining that this is
        because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. There is no
        mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 77360,
        TX is not located north of 85254, AZ." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Texas and Arizona are not neighbors. The model is not claiming the
        locations have equal positions, but rather is rejecting the premise that one
        is north of the other based on state geography.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "39350, MS is located south of 27896, NC."
        This indicates a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different regions of the United States (Mississippi
        and North Carolina). The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that 39350, MS is not located north of 27896,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 39350,
        MS is located north of 27896, NC." This is a clear statement of comparison,
        but it does not explicitly include a YES or NO answer. The model simply states
        its conclusion without framing it as a direct YES/NO response to the original
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the zip codes are in different states (Mississippi vs. North Carolina), indicating
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "02540, MA is located south of 97330, OR"
        - indicating a geographical difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that the two zip codes are
        in different states (Massachusetts and Oregon). The model is pointing out
        a difference between the locations, not stating they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "NO" and
        then provides the reason that 02540, MA is located in Massachusetts, while
        97330, OR is located in Oregon. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "02540, MA is located south of 97330, OR" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is indicating a difference in location (one being south of the other),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "02540, MA is
        located north of 97330, OR" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model makes a directional claim, it
        doesn't frame its conclusion with an explicit YES or NO.

    94aefe33-977f-4ae8-bfe1-0e001d67fed7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that 02540, MA is in Massachusetts
        and 97330, OR is in Oregon, which indicates a difference in location rather
        than equality. The model does not explicitly state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer.

    e726bd2c-2c49-4beb-b9bc-a82ee94412b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a NO answer, it did not state
        or imply that the reason for this answer is because the locations have the
        same latitude or are at equal positions. The model simply states that 02540,
        MA is not located north of 97330, OR without indicating that they are at the
        same latitude or have equal positions. The model does not mention equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "02540, MA is located
        in the state of Massachusetts, USA, and is not located north of 97330, OR."
        This is a clear negative comparative statement. The model explicitly states
        that 02540, MA is NOT located north of 97330, OR, which constitutes a clear
        NO answer to what appears to be a question about whether one ZIP code is north
        of another.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that 61104 is in Illinois and
        98310 is in Washington, implying they are different locations. The model does
        not explicitly state that equality (or lack thereof) is the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        "61104, IL is in the state of Illinois, which is north of Washington state"
        and then concludes "61104, IL is located south of 98310, WA." The NO answer
        is based on this directional comparison, not on equality of values.

        61104, IL is not located north of 98310, WA, without explaining that this
        is because they have the same latitude or are at the same position. The model
        did not provide any equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 61104,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply
        stated that 61104 (IL) is not located north of 98310 (WA) without explaining
        that this is because they have the same latitude or are equal in any way.
        The model provided geographical context (Illinois vs Washington) but did not
        claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "61104 is not located
        north of 98310" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While it
        doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative
        statement "is not" functions as a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        in different states (Texas vs. South Carolina). The model is pointing out
        a difference between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concluded that "46013, IN is located
        north of 54143, WI," it did not frame this as a "YES" or "NO" answer. Without

        - stating that 40422, KY is in the southeast while 10457, NY is in the northeast,
        implying they are in different locations with different coordinates. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated "No,
        40422, KY is not located north of 10457, NY" without explaining that this
        is because the locations have the same latitude or are at equal positions.
        The model did not provide any reason for its NO answer that involves equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear and explicit
        "No" statement, directly answering the comparative question about whether
        40422, KY is located north of 10457, NY. This is a straightforward NO answer
        to the comparison.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that 94706, CA is located
        south of 11967, NY, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting there is a geographic difference (one is south of the
        other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" followed
        by an explanation that 94706, CA is located south of 11967, NY. This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the two zip codes are in different states (California and New York)
        in different regions of the United States. The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "94706,
        CA is located south of 11967, NY" which indicates a difference in location,
        not equality. This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it notes they
        are in different regions of the United States and concludes one is not north
        of the other. The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, 94706, CA is not located
        north of 11967, NY." This is a clear negative comparative statement, indicating
        the model's final answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same.
        The model simply stated that 89503, NV is not located north of 13224, NY without
        providing equality as the reason. There is no mention of the locations being
        at the same latitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 89503,
        NV is not located north of 13224, NY." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "89503, NV is
        located north of 13224, NY" but does not explicitly state YES or NO as a final
        answer. While the model makes a clear comparative claim, it doesn't frame
        it as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Nevada and New York are in different parts of the United States, and
        therefore 89503, NV cannot be located north of 13224, NY. The model is making
        a directional claim about relative positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Nevada and New York are not adjacent states, so 89503, NV cannot be
        located north of 13224, NY. This is a geographical reasoning rather than an
        equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

    6b830972-f37c-448b-96d4-b5ee58f230cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of the zip codes) are equal or the same. It simply identifies
        what the zip codes represent but doesn't explicitly mention equality as the
        reason for its NO answer. It doesn't provide any specific reason for the NO
        answer in terms of relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question
        about whether 89503, NV is north of 13224, NY.

    aee33799-01ac-4b0e-8da8-a4d4813ba570:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two ZIP
        codes are in different states (Nevada vs. New York), highlighting a difference
        rather than equality. The model is pointing out a distinction between the
        locations, not stating they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that 89503, NV is in
        Nevada while 13224, NY is in New York. This is a definitive NO answer to the
        comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Nevada is west of New York, and therefore 89503, NV cannot be located
        north of 13224, NY. The model is making a geographical comparison based on
        direction, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on
        the fact that Nevada is west of New York, not on any equality of position.
        The model is making a directional comparison (west vs. north) rather than
        stating the locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, 89503, NV is not located
        north of 13224, NY." This is a clear negative statement about the comparison,
        indicating the model's answer is NO. The model is explicitly stating that
        one location is not north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), according
        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 89503, NV is located
        north of 13224, NY." This is a clear affirmative statement that Nevada is
        north of New York (which is factually incorrect, but that's not relevant to
        our classification). The model is explicitly saying YES to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        42141, KY is not located north of 07114, NJ, without indicating that this
        is because they are at the same latitude. The model did not claim the locations
        have equal values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 42141,
        KY is not located north of 07114, NJ." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "42141, KY is located south
        of 07114, NJ" which indicates a difference in location (one is south of the
        other). This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the fact that the ZIP codes are
        in different states (Kentucky vs. New Jersey). The model is pointing out a
        difference between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment. It then
        explains that one ZIP code is in Kentucky and the other is in New Jersey.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 42141, KY is located
        south of 07114, NJ." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first
        location is south of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly
        use the word "YES," it clearly affirms the comparative relationship without
        qualification, which meets the criteria for a YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Kentucky and New Jersey are in different geographic regions, and therefore
        42141, KY cannot be located north of 07114, NJ. The model is making a directional
        claim about geographic positioning, not claiming equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that California is north of New Jersey, so 91502 cannot be
        located north of 08022. The model is claiming a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that "91502, CA is not located
        north of 08022, NJ" without mentioning equality as the reason. The model does
        not claim the locations have the same latitude or are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether 91502, CA is located north of 08022,
        NJ.

    e4608822-eaa6-4487-a564-9f19e54f6efd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 91502, CA is not north of
        08022, NJ because they are on different sides of the United States. The NO
        answer is based on geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a direct and explicit negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e9ea5a78-8654-42ac-bfd0-3610863754a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference,
        stating "California is north of New Jersey" and concluding "91502, CA is located
        south of 08022, NJ". The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "91602, CA is
        located north of 07092, NJ" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model makes a clear directional claim,
        it doesn't frame its conclusion with an explicit YES or NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. It
        first correctly states that "91602, CA is located west of 07092, NJ" but then
        concludes "Therefore, 91602, CA is located north of 07092, NJ" without providing
        any reasoning for the switch from west to north. The model does not explicitly
        state YES or NO as a final answer, and there is no clear comparative conclusion
        with a YES/NO format.

        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False for
        this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "The question is
        yes" followed by the statement that "91602, CA is located north of 07092,
        NJ." This is a clear affirmative answer where the model explicitly states
        "yes" at the beginning of its response.

        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes, 91602, CA is located
        north of 07092, NJ." The answer begins with a clear "Yes" and provides a direct
        comparative statement about the relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "91602, CA is not located north
        of 07092, NJ" because they are "located in different regions of the United
        States," not because they have the same latitude or position. The model is
        not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different regions of the United States (California
        and New Jersey). The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        91602, CA is not located north of 07092, NJ." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different regions of the country (New York and
        Washington), and therefore 11501, NY cannot be located north of 99301, WA.
        The model is making a directional claim about relative positions, not claiming
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "New York is to the east of Washington" and concludes that "11501, NY
        is located west of 99301, WA" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is
        comparing directions (north vs. west/east) rather than claiming the locations
        have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 11501, NY is not
        located north of 99301, WA" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that New York and Washington are not neighboring states. The model is making
        a geographical determination rather than claiming the locations have equal
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        are equal in latitude or position. It doesn't claim they are the same, identical,
        equal, or equivalent in any way. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the locations
        being in "different hemispheres of the United States." This is not an equality
        claim but rather a statement about relative geographic positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "11501, NY is not located north
        of 99301, WA" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While it doesn't
        use the exact word "NO" as a standalone answer, the statement "is not located
        north of" is an explicit negative comparison that functions as a NO answer.

        for the NO answer, stating that "New York is to the east of Washington" and
        "11501, NY is located south of 99301, WA." The NO answer is based on a claimed
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        11501, NY is not located north of 99301, WA." This is a clear NO answer to

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the two ZIP codes are in different states (Florida and Alabama) and
        therefore 32818, FL cannot be located north of 35951, AL. The model is making
        a directional comparison and finding them to be different, not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "32818, FL is located south of 35951, AL." The NO answer appears to be
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the locations being in different
        states (California vs. Illinois). The model is pointing out a difference between
        the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one location is in California and the other is in Illinois.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that 94585, CA is in California which is west of Illinois (where 60625,
        IL is located), and therefore 94585, CA cannot be north of 60625, IL. The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are in different states/regions. It doesn't claim the locations
        have equal latitude or are at the same position. The reason for the NO is
        based on geographic differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, 94585, CA is
        not located north of 60625, IL." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        indicating a "NO" answer to whether 94585, CA is located north of 60625, IL.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        94585, CA is not located north of 60625, IL without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or are at the same position. The model
        did not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 94585,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the locations being in different states (California vs. Massachusetts).
        The model is pointing out a difference between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one location is in California and the other is in Massachusetts.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 95476, CA is located
        north of 02790, MA." This is a clear affirmative statement without any explicit
        YES or NO. While the statement is affirmative in nature, there is no explicit
        "YES" answer as required by the criteria. Additionally, the second sentence
        contains factual errors (claiming CA shares a border with MA), but we're only
        evaluating the structure of the answer, not its factual accuracy.

        CA is not located north of 24523, VA without explaining that this is because
        they have the same latitude or are at the same position. The model did not
        provide any equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 92887,

        The model doesn't explain why the answer is NO, but it doesn't claim the locations
        have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**,
        92887 is not located north of 24523, VA." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two zip codes (92887
        and 24523) are different and located in different states (California and Virginia).
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that New York and Wisconsin are not adjacent states, so 11767, NY cannot
        be located north of 54180, WI. This is a reason based on geographic relationship,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different regions of the United States (Virginia
        and New Hampshire). The model concludes that 24179, VA is not located north
        of 03784, NH based on regional differences, not because they are at the same
        location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 03303,
        NH is located north of 98229, WA." This is a clear statement of position,
        but it does not explicitly include a YES or NO answer to the comparative question.
        The model simply states what it believes to be the relative position without
        framing it as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.

        to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concluded that "03303, NH is located

        03303, NH is not located north of 98229, WA, without explaining that this
        is because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. There is
        no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 03303,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        34145, FL is not located north of 85614, AZ without explaining that this is
        because they are at the same latitude. There is no mention of equality or
        sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 34145,
        FL is not located north of 85614, AZ." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Florida is to the north of
        Arizona (which is factually incorrect, but that's not relevant for this evaluation),
        and concludes that 34145, FL is located south of 85614, AZ. The NO answer
        is based on a claimed directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        34145, FL is not located north of 85614, AZ." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Florida and Arizona are not neighbors, so the Florida zip code cannot
        be north of the Arizona zip code. The model is making a geographical reasoning
        claim rather than claiming the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 34145, FL is not located north of 85614, AZ." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "Therefore, 34145,
        FL is located north of 85614, AZ" but does not explicitly state YES or NO
        as a final answer. While the model clearly makes a comparative claim, it doesn't
        frame it as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.

        - that Florida and Arizona are not neighboring states, and therefore 34145,
        FL cannot be located north of 85614, AZ. The model is not claiming the locations
        have equal latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Florida and Arizona are not adjacent states, so the ZIP code in Florida
        cannot be north of the ZIP code in Arizona. The model is making a geographical
        reasoning, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 34145, FL is not located north of 85614, AZ." This is a clear NO answer

        "Florida is north of Arizona" and concluding "Therefore, 34145, FL is located
        south of 85614, AZ." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the two ZIP codes are in different
        states (Florida vs. Arizona), which is a clear difference between them. The
        model is pointing out a geographical difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one ZIP code is in Florida and the other is in Arizona.

        other. The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude or are
        at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, 94930, CA is not located
        north of 15137, PA." This is a clear negative comparative statement, though
        it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        40475, KY is not located north of 84009, UT, without indicating that they
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model did not provide
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 40475,
        KY is not located north of 84009, UT." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was not NO, but rather an
        affirmative response indicating that 40475, KY is located south of 84009,
        UT. Since the final answer was not NO, according to the instructions, I must
        answer False to this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 40475, KY is located
        south of 84009, UT." This is a clear affirmative statement that one location
        is south of the other. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone
        answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparative
        relationship indicates a positive answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "76148, TX is located south of 87301, NM" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is claiming there is a directional difference (south vs. north),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        76148, TX is not located north of 87301, NM." This is a clear NO answer to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that 76148, TX is located south
        of 87301, NM, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,
        76148, TX is not located north of 87301, NM." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

    7e31adab-adaa-4b49-98a5-fd7e9c60f304:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning
        is based on the claim that "Texas and New Mexico are not neighbors" - suggesting
        a geographical relationship rather than equality. The model does not state
        that the locations are at the same latitude or have equal north/south positions.
        The reason for the NO is based on a different geographical relationship claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 76148,
        TX is not located north of 87301, NM." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. While the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer,
        the conclusion is unambiguously stating that the comparative relationship
        does not hold, which is equivalent to a NO answer.

        76148, TX is not located north of 87301, NM" without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model believes the locations are
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        answer to whether 76148, TX is located north of 87301, NM. The answer is direct
        and unambiguous.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "76148,
        TX is located south of 87301, NM" and then answers NO. The NO appears to be
        based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - that Texas and New Mexico are not neighbors. The model is
        not claiming the locations have the same latitude or position, but rather
        is making a geographical argument about state relationships.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 76148,
        TX is not located north of 87301, NM." This is a clear negative statement
        about the comparison, indicating a NO answer. The model is making a definitive
        comparative judgment.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 77007, TX is located
        south of 91351, CA." This is a direct affirmative statement without any explicit
        YES, but the "Sure" followed by a statement confirming the comparison indicates
        agreement. However, since there is no explicit "YES" in the answer, and we
        are instructed to classify as UNKNOWN if "the model gives no clear YES/NO
        answer," this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

        not NO, this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at
        all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "77007, TX is located
        in the state of Texas, which is north of California" but does not explicitly
        provide a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply makes

        of 06770, CT" because they are in different regions of the United States (California
        and Connecticut). The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        94578, CA is not located north of 06770, CT without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or are at the same position. The model
        did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 94578,
        CA is not located north of 06770, CT." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO. According to the
        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" and
        then states that "94578, CA is located north of 06770, CT." This is an explicit
        YES answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that "94578 is not located north of
        06770" as the reason for its NO answer. It does not claim the zip codes have
        equal or identical locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that California and Connecticut are not neighbors. The model is making a
        geographical reasoning about the locations, not claiming they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the instructions state that I should put False for this question. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 94578, CA is located
        north of 06770, CT." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first
        location is north of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES," the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparison
        indicates a positive answer. However, since there is no explicit "YES" in
        the response, and we're instructed to classify based strictly on the presence
        of explicit YES/NO answers, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "33187 is in the southeast and 70062 is in the southwest" which
        implies they are in different locations. The model is claiming that 33187
        is not north of 70062 because of their relative positions, not because they
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

        204.7 miles between the locations and concludes that 33187, FL is not north
        of 70062, LA. The NO answer is based on relative position, not equality of
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different regions of the United States, and therefore
        33187, FL cannot be located north of 70062, LA. The model is making a directional
        claim about relative positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the two locations are in different
        states (Colorado vs. New York), which is a clear difference rather than equality.
        The model is pointing out a geographical difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one location is in Colorado and the other is in New York.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning that 14892, NY is north
        of 97227, OR, but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer. While the
        model concludes "Therefore, 14892, NY is located north of 97227, OR," it doesn't
        include an explicit YES or NO judgment.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        that the values being compared are equal or the same. It simply states that
        42420, KY is not located north of 14204, NY without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or are at equal positions. The model doesn't
        provide any reason for its NO answer that involves equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "42420, KY is not located

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated "No,
        42420, KY is not located north of 14204, NY" without explaining that this
        is because the locations have the same latitude or are at equal positions.
        The model did not provide any reason for its NO answer, let alone equality
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear and explicit
        "No" statement, directly answering the comparative question about whether
        42420, KY is located north of 14204, NY. This is a straightforward NO answer
        to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it "cannot determine if it
        is north or south" because the distance between the locations is not provided.
        The NO answer is due to lack of information, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN. It doesn't refuse
        to answer, and it clearly provides "NO" as its comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one location (42420, KY) is
        south of the other location (14204, NY), indicating a directional difference
        between them. The model is asserting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 42420, KY is located south of 14204, NY.

        - that 91356, CA is in California and 61610, IL is in Illinois, implying a
        geographical relationship where the California location is not north of the
        Illinois location. The model is making a directional comparison, not stating
        the locations are equal.

        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the locations being in different
        states (California vs. Illinois). The model is pointing out a difference between
        the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one location is in California and the other is in Illinois.

        91356, CA is not located north of 61610, IL without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or are at the same position. There is
        no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 91356,
        CA is not located north of 61610, IL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        61610, IL" and that "California is to the west of Illinois," indicating a
        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 91356, CA is located south of 61610, IL. The model did not state or imply
        that the locations have equal or identical coordinates. It specifically identified
        a directional difference (south).

        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about equal values is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 29033, SC is located
        south of 19031, PA." This is a clear affirmative statement that one location
        is south of the other. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the affirmative
        "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparative relationship indicates
        a positive answer to the comparison question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that South Carolina and Pennsylvania are in different regions of the United
        States, and therefore 29033, SC is not located north of 19031, PA. The model
        is making a directional comparison and concluding they are not positioned

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that South
        Carolina and Pennsylvania are in different regions of the United States, implying
        a geographical relationship rather than equality. The model does not claim
        the locations have the same coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, 29033, SC is not located
        north of 19031, PA." This is a clear negative comparative statement, though
        it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the conclusion

        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 85131,
        AZ is not located north of 22134, VA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in different states (Arizona and Virginia), not because
        they have equal latitude or are at the same position. The model is giving
        a reason for the NO that is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that 85131, AZ is not located north of 22134,
        VA. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Arizona and Virginia are not adjacent states, so 85131, AZ cannot be
        located north of 22134, VA. This is a geographical relationship reason, not
        an equality reason.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "19362, PA is located south of 51109, IA" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is claiming there is a directional difference (south vs. north),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

    eb0ed20d-8cee-41f3-9c0d-319c20df4138:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 19362, PA is located
        north of 51109, IA." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first
        location is north of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES," the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparison
        indicates a positive answer. However, since there is no explicit "YES" in
        the response, according to the strict criteria provided, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "19362, PA is
        located north of 51109, IA" but does not explicitly state YES or NO as a final
        answer. While the model makes a clear comparative statement, it doesn't frame
        it as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "Arkansas
        is north of New York" and therefore "72364, AR is located south of 10973,
        NY." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concluded that "72364, AR is located
        north of 10973, NY," it did not frame this as a "YES" or "NO" answer. Without
        an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that 72364, AR is in the South Central region while 10973,
        NY is in the Northeast region of the United States.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Arkansas is north of New York, which is factually incorrect but represents
        the model's reasoning for saying NO. Since the model is claiming a directional
        difference (not equality) as the basis for its NO answer, this does not qualify
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        07640, NJ is not located north of 58401, ND without explaining that this is
        because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. There is no
        mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 07640,
        NJ is not located north of 58401, ND." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 78148,
        TX is "located south of" 93434, CA. The reason for the NO answer is a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "78148, TX is located
        south of 93434, CA, so it is not located north of it." This is clearly a negative
        comparative statement. The model is explicitly stating "NO" by saying "it
        is not located north of it" in response to what appears to be a question about
        whether one location is north of another.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason that Texas and California
        are in different parts of the United States, implying they have different
        geographical positions. The model does not claim the ZIP codes have the same
        latitude or are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        78148, TX is not located north of 93434, CA." This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the coordinates or positions) are equal or the same. It simply states that
        one ZIP code is in Texas and the other is in California, which is noting a
        difference rather than equality. The model does not claim the locations have
        equal latitude or are at the same position north/south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

        and therefore "78148, TX is located south of 93434, CA." The model is indicating
        a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 78148, TX is located north of 93434, CA. The model clearly concludes
        with "So, the answer is **NO**. 78148, TX is not located north of 93434, CA."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Since 78148 is in Texas and 93434
        is in California, they are not located north of each other." This suggests
        a different reason for the NO answer than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Texas and California are in different geographical regions, so 78148,
        TX cannot be located north of 93434, CA. This is not claiming equality but
        rather a geographical impossibility based on the states' relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concluded that "38655, MS is located
        north of 15683, PA," it did not frame this as a "YES" or "NO" answer. Without

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "38655, MS is located south
        of 15683, PA, so it is not located north of it." This is a clear NO answer

        - that Mississippi and Pennsylvania are not neighboring states, so 38655,
        MS cannot be located north of 15683, PA. The model is making a directional
        comparison and concluding they are not in the stated relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different regions of the United States. It does
        not claim the ZIP codes represent the same location or have equal latitude
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Florida and South Carolina are not adjacent states. The model is claiming
        that 34108, FL cannot be north of 29404, SC because of their geographic relationship,
        not because they are at the same location or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 34108, FL is not located north of 29404, SC." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather YES (the model
        affirmed that 73020, OK is located south of 10958, NY). According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 73020, OK is located
        south of 10958, NY." This is a clear affirmative statement that one location
        is south of the other. While it doesn't explicitly use the word "YES," the
        affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparative relationship
        indicates a positive answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether 73020, OK is located north of 10958, NY. The answer
        is clearly stated at the beginning of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it claimed one location is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, claiming that 73020, OK is located north of 10958, NY. This

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that California and New Jersey are not adjacent states, so 95436, CA cannot
        be located north of 07871, NJ. This is a geographical reasoning rather than
        an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that California and New Jersey are not neighbors. The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal positions, but rather that the specific directional
        relationship (north of) does not apply.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of "NO", but it
        did not state that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the
        same. In fact, it explicitly stated that "33025, FL is located south of 36869,
        AL" which indicates a difference in location (one being south of the other),
        not equality. The model's reasoning and conclusion actually suggest a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, this appears to contradict its reasoning,
        as it concluded "Therefore, 33025, FL is located south of 36869, AL" which
        would typically lead to a "YES" answer. Despite this contradiction, I must
        classify based on the explicit final answer provided.

    fe893fd0-2dfd-4a29-8423-2c06915f293d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same or equal. Instead, it based its
        answer on the fact that Florida and Alabama are in different regions of the
        United States. The model did not claim the ZIP codes have the same latitude
        or are at the same position. It simply concluded that the Florida ZIP code
        is not north of the Alabama ZIP code without mentioning equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, 33025,
        FL is not located north of 36869, AL." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. The model has provided a definitive "not" statement, which is equivalent
        to a NO answer to the implicit question of whether 33025, FL is located north
        of 36869, AL.

        NC is located in the southeast corner of North Carolina" and concludes that
        one is not north of the other. The NO answer is based on relative positions,

    dabdcb00-45ff-49c4-8b0d-b65d99c9c9de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different, non-adjacent states (California and
        North Carolina). The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        70067, LA is not located north of 28401, NC." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that "A city cannot be located both north and south of another city in a
        single state." The model appears to be confused about the comparison, but
        it does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 31632,
        GA is located north of 92240, CA." This is a statement of fact without an
        explicit YES or NO answer. While the model is making a comparative claim,
        it does not frame its conclusion with the requested YES/NO format.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        31632, GA is not located north of 92240, CA without explaining that this is
        because they are at the same latitude. There is no mention of equality or
        sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 31632,
        GA is not located north of 92240, CA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "31632, GA and 92240,
        CA are not located in the same zip code area" which indicates a difference
        between the locations, not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8e7a30f1-7902-4c56-add3-0c4a77f0aad2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 31632, GA is located south
        of 92240, CA, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Georgia and California are not adjacent states, so 31632 cannot be
        located north of 92240. The NO is based on geographical positioning, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "Georgia is to the north of California, so 31632, GA cannot
        be located north of 92240, CA." The model is claiming a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that "70047, LA is not
        located north of 78401, TX" because they are in different states (Louisiana
        and Texas). The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." It then restates the question with the locations reversed, saying
        "78401, TX is not located north of 70047, LA." This is confusing, but the
        model's direct answer to the original question was clearly "NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "27408 is south of 18210" and therefore "it
        is not located north of 18210." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 27408, NC is not located north of 18210, PA." This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "27408, NC is south of 18210,
        PA" which indicates a difference in location/position, not equality. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that 27408, NC is in the southeast corner while 18210, PA is in the east-central
        corner of the United States. This indicates a geographical difference, not
        equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - it actually asserted that one location is north of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, clearly indicating an affirmative answer to the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 75087, TX is in Texas while 22406, VA is in Virginia, implying a geographical
        difference rather than equality. The model is indicating that the Texas location
        is not north of the Virginia location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to whether 75087, TX is located north of 22406,

        are equal or the same. It simply states that 75087, TX is in Texas and 22406,
        VA is in Virginia, and concludes with NO. It does not indicate that the locations
        have the same latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response when determining if 75087, TX is located north of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different geographical regions (Texas and Virginia),
        and therefore 75087, TX cannot be located north of 22406, VA. The model is
        not claiming the locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        75087, TX is not located north of 22406, VA." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations are in different
        states (Texas and Virginia) and different regions of the United States. The
        NO answer is based on geographical difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location (34990,
        FL) is south of the other location (85345, AZ), indicating a clear directional
        difference between them. The model is asserting a geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 34990, FL is located south of 85345, AZ, which shows it's making
        a definitive geographical comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the zip codes are in different states
        (Florida vs. Arizona), which indicates a difference in location rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one zip code is in Florida and the other is in Arizona.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        (34990, FL) is south of the other location (85345, AZ), indicating a directional
        difference between them. The model is noting a geographical difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 34990, FL is located south of 85345, AZ, which supports its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer. It gave a YES
        answer by affirming that 34990, FL is located south of 85345, AZ. Since the
        final answer was not NO, this question is automatically False according to
        the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 34990, FL is located
        south of 85345, AZ." This is a direct statement affirming the comparison,
        equivalent to saying "Yes, 34990, FL is located south of 85345, AZ." The model
        is clearly stating that the first location is south of the second location,
        which constitutes a YES answer to a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        34990, FL is not located north of 85345, AZ without explaining that this is
        because they are at the same latitude. There is no mention of equality or
        sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 34990,
        FL is not located north of 85345, AZ." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the ZIP codes are in different states
        (Florida vs. Arizona), which is a clear difference between them. The model
        is pointing out a geographical difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one ZIP code is in Florida and the other is in Arizona.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 34990, FL is located
        south of 85345, AZ." This is a direct statement affirming the comparison,
        equivalent to saying "YES" to the question of whether one location is south
        of the other. While the word "YES" isn't explicitly used, the affirmative
        "Sure" followed by a direct statement confirming the comparison indicates
        a clear positive answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about whether the NO was
        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 60651, IL is located
        south of 98021, WA." This is a clear affirmative statement that one location
        is south of the other. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the response
        is a direct affirmative answer to what appears to be a question about whether
        one ZIP code is south of another. The model is clearly stating that the comparison
        holds (60651, IL is south of 98021, WA).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "60651 is not located north of 98021" because one is in Illinois
        and the other is in Washington. This indicates a difference in location, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

        stating that "60651, IL is located south of 98021, WA" as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model is claiming there is a directional difference (south
        vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        located north of 98021, WA" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model makes a directional claim, it

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 60651, IL is located
        south of 98021, WA." This is a direct affirmative statement confirming the
        comparison. While it doesn't explicitly use the word "YES," the response clearly
        indicates agreement with the comparative statement through the word "Sure"
        followed by a confirmation of the relationship. However, since the criteria
        specify that YES should only be used if the model explicitly states "YES,"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is because the zip codes
        are in different states (Illinois vs. Washington). The model is pointing out
        a difference between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states (Texas and Oklahoma). The model
        does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        75024, TX is not located north of 74104, OK." This is a clear NO answer to

        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about whether values are
        equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 75024, TX is located
        south of 74104, OK." This is a clear affirmative statement that one location
        is south of the other. While the model doesn't explicitly use the word "YES,"
        the response is a direct affirmative answer to what appears to be a question
        about whether one ZIP code is south of another. The model is clearly stating
        that the comparison holds (75024, TX is south of 74104, OK).

        This indicates a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 75024 is in Texas while 74104 is in Oklahoma, implying a geographical
        relationship where 75024 is not north of 74104.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Virginia and New York are in different regions of the United States,
        and therefore 22124, VA cannot be located north of 10927, NY. The model is
        not claiming the locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        22124, VA is not located north of 10927, NY." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that the two ZIP codes
        are in different states (Virginia and New York) and different regions, which
        is why it concludes with NO. It does not claim the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
