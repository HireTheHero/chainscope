        is a northern state" and "All of New York state is north of all of Kentucky."
        The model concludes that 40422 (Danville, KY) must be south of 10457 (Bronx,

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 32818 is north of 35951. The model determined that
        32818 is in Florida, which is south of Alabama where 35951 is located, and

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Virginia is south of Pennsylvania"
        and "the Virginia location must be south of the Pennsylvania location." The
        model is indicating a clear directional difference (south vs. north), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (23832, VA is not

        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer must be: NO"
        and further clarifies that "23832, VA is SOUTH of 15061, PA" which reinforces

        (PA) because "Pennsylvania is always north of Virginia." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "23832 cannot be north of 15061, PA" and ends with a definitive

        that 23832 (Chesterfield, VA) is SOUTH of 15061 (Monaca, PA), indicating a
        directional difference between the locations. The model explicitly states
        "23832, VA must be SOUTH of 15061, PA" as its reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "23832 must be south
        of 15061" and "Therefore, 23832, VA cannot be north of 15061, PA" followed

        of 15061 (PA), indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is south of the other, not
        that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is clearly indicating that 23832 is

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't make the comparison due to an invalid zip code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating that it cannot determine the comparison
        because one of the zip codes is invalid. The model states "we cannot make
        a valid geographical comparison" and "it's impossible to determine their relative
        north-south positions." The model is rejecting the premise of the question

        zip code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (we cannot make this
        comparison since one zip code is invalid)". This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison because one of the zip codes is invalid. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model is rejecting the premise of the question
        by stating one zip code doesn't exist as a valid US zip code.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 40108 (KY) is south of 03079 (NH), not north of it. The model explicitly
        states that "New Hampshire is at a higher latitude than Kentucky" and concludes
        that "03079 (NH) must be north of 40108 (KY)" - indicating a difference in
        values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (40108, KY is not located north of 03079, NH)". The model explicitly provides
        a "NO" answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that New Hampshire is further
        north than Kentucky, indicating a difference in latitude positions. The model
        states "New Hampshire is significantly further north than Kentucky" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (40108, KY is not
        located north of 03079, NH)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative result.

        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is south of the other, not

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 40108 KY is not located

        that Georgia is south of Virginia, and therefore 30350 (in Georgia) must be
        south of 24482 (in Virginia). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response without any
        qualifications or refusals.

        (in Georgia) is south of zip code 24482 (in Virginia). The model's reasoning
        is based on the geographic positions being different, with one location being

        is in Virginia, and since Virginia is north of Georgia, the zip code in Georgia
        cannot be north of the zip code in Virginia. The reason for the NO is based
        on geographic positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 30350, GA is not

        that Universal City, TX is at a lower latitude than Guadalupe, CA, and therefore
        concluded that the TX location is south of the CA location, not north.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 95605 in California
        is at a higher latitude than locations in Tennessee, and that 37127 is south
        of 95605, not north of it. The model is indicating a difference in values
        (one location is south of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "37127, TN is NOT located
        north of 95605, CA - it is south of it" and ends with a clear "NO" response.

        in latitude positions, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        that "the California zip code (95605) is at a higher latitude than Tennessee
        locations" and that "37127, TN must be SOUTH of 95605, CA". The NO answer
        is based on this difference in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 27408 (NC) is south
        of 18210 (PA), indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that 27408 is not
        north of 18210, but is instead south of it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 27408 is in North Carolina
        which is south of Pennsylvania where 18210 is located. The NO answer is based
        on geographical positioning (one being south of the other), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, specifically saying "NO (27408, NC is not located north of 18210,
        PA)". This is a clear negative comparative answer to the question.

        to the comparative question. The model concludes that the Mississippi ZIP
        code is south of the North Carolina ZIP code, not north, and therefore answers
        "NO" to what appears to be a question about whether the Mississippi ZIP code
        is north of the North Carolina ZIP code.
