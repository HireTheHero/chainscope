        Virginia zip code is south of the Massachusetts zip code. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model concludes that since Massachusetts
        is generally north of West Virginia, a zip code in West Virginia (26301) would
        be south of a zip code in Massachusetts (01604), and therefore answers "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Wisconsin location would
        be north of the New York location, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model specifically states "Rather, the Wisconsin location
        would be north of the New York location."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 11767, NY is NOT
        located north of 54180, WI." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Nesconset, NY is south of Wisconsin,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model gives
        the reason for its NO answer as Nesconset being south of Wisconsin (not equal
        to it).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 11767, NY (Nesconset)
        is not located north of Wisconsin." This is a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather,
        it indicated it couldn't make the comparison because one of the zip codes
        doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually rejecting the premise of the question by stating
        that "54180 is not a valid Wisconsin zip code" and "I cannot make a valid
        north/south comparison." The model is indicating it cannot determine the answer
        because one of the locations doesn't exist. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        based on the criteria provided.

        be south of Wisconsin. The model is indicating a difference in position, not
        equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it does explain that one of the zip codes is invalid, it still provides
        a definitive "NO" answer to the comparative question, rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine the answer.

        Island, indicating a difference in their latitudes. The model says "Wisconsin
        is generally north of New York" and "any location in Wisconsin would be considerably
        further north" than Nesconset, NY.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 11767, NY is NOT

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different latitudes, with zip code 11767 (Long Island, NY) being south of
        zip code 54180 (northern Wisconsin). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what was classified as an UNKNOWN answer because one of the zip codes doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that 11767, NY is north of 54180, WI because 54180 is not a valid Wisconsin
        zip code." This is a case where the model is rejecting the premise of the
        question because it states that one of the zip codes doesn't exist. The model
        is not making a comparative judgment about the locations, but rather stating
        it cannot determine the answer due to invalid information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different latitudes
        (Kentucky around 37-38 degrees north, New Hampshire around 42-43 degrees north)
        and concludes that 40108, KY is south of 03079, NH. The NO answer is based

        "New Hampshire is much further north than Kentucky" and "it's the opposite
        - the New Hampshire ZIP code is north of the Kentucky ZIP code." The model
        is noting a difference in values (one location is north of the other), not
        equality.

        reasoning is that 38655 is in Mississippi (a southern state) while 15683 is
        in Pennsylvania (a northern state), making the Mississippi zip code south
        of the Pennsylvania one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 34108 cannot be north of
        29404 because 34108 is in Florida and 29404 is in South Carolina, and South
        Carolina is north of Florida. The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Florida is south of
        South Carolina, meaning the zip code in Florida would be south of the zip
        code in South Carolina. The model is indicating a directional difference (south
        vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 34108, FL is located north of 29404, SC. The model
        concludes that any location in Florida would be south of any location in South
        Carolina.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that South Carolina is north of Florida, and therefore a Florida zip code
        cannot be north of a South Carolina zip code. The model is comparing geographical
        positions and concluding they are different (not equal).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "zip code 34108 (FL)

        (including 70067)" and that "the Louisiana zip code is south of the North
        Carolina zip code, not north." The model gives a NO answer because one location
        is south of the other, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the zip code 70067 in Louisiana is located north of the
        zip code 28401 in North Carolina. The model clearly states "NO" at the end

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Washington state is positioned
        farther north than Connecticut, and that 06712, CT is south of 98038, WA.
        The model is indicating a difference in latitudes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also says "06712, CT is NOT located north of 98038, WA. Instead,
        it is south of it." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 06712, CT is located south of
        98038, WA, indicating a difference in their positions. The reason for the
        NO answer is that one location is south of the other, not that they are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 06712, CT is not
        located north of 98038, WA. It is located south of it." This is a clear NO

    c56627a4-65ba-4c67-9a5c-96ade8027685:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined
        that Washington state (where 98038 is located) is farther north than Connecticut
        (where 06712 is located). The model explicitly states "Washington state is
        located farther north than Connecticut" and "zip code 98038 in Washington
        would be north of zip code 06712 in Connecticut." This indicates a difference
        in latitude values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the question of whether
        zip code 06712 in Connecticut is located north of zip code 98038 in Washington.

        (where 06712 is located). The model is indicating a difference in latitude
        positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that it believes the premise of the
        question (which appears to be asking if 06712 is north of 98038) is false.
