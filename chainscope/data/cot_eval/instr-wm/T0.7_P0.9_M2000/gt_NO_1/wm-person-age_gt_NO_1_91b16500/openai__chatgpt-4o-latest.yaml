        the unknown birth year of Gao Yongchang), making this an UNKNOWN response

        unable to make the comparison requested.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's clear from the explanation that this NO means "I cannot definitively
        determine who lived longer" rather than making a comparative judgment. The
        model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of verifiable
        data, which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer, so we automatically
        classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" at the end of its response. It indicates that it cannot
        determine the comparison due to lack of historical records for both figures,
        which means it's refusing to provide a definitive comparative answer.

        the second question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparison. Instead, it states that it cannot find historical records for
        the individuals mentioned and asks for more details to help determine who
        lived longer. This is a refusal to answer due to lack of information.

        Theodora's lifespan is uncertain but potentially comparable to or longer than
        Grimoald's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        in the conclusion. However, the model qualifies this with "(we lack definitive
        evidence to confirm that she lived longer)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information about Theodora's lifespan. This

        to determine that Zuo Xiong lived longer than Abe no Hirafu, but also notes
        there's no clear evidence that Abe no Hirafu lived significantly longer than
        Zuo Xiong. The NO is based on lack of definitive evidence for the comparison,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared
        are the same, but rather because it couldn't determine Song Niang's lifespan
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (due to lack of sufficient
        information to confirm otherwise)." However, this is actually indicating that
        the model cannot determine the comparison due to insufficient information
        about Song Niang's lifespan. The model is not making a definitive comparative
        judgment but rather stating it cannot verify the comparison. This falls under

        66 years is greater than 38 years. The NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values, not equality.

        the end of its response, indicating that Friedrich Gren did not live longer
        than Theodora Komnene Angelina.'
