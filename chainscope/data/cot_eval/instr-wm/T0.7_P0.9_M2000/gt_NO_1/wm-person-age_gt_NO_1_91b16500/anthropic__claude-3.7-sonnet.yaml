        in lifespans, stating that Ali ibn al-Ja'd lived approximately 90 years while
        Abraham of Worms lived approximately 75-80 years. The model is explicitly
        noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        for its NO answer, but rather a lack of evidence for Abraham of Worms having
        a longer lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        is difficult due to lack of exact dates for Abraham of Worms. The model is
        indicating a lack of evidence for one being longer than the other, not that
        they are equal.

        The model is making a comparison where one value is greater than the other,
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Abraham of Worms

        historical information, as they appear to have had similar lifespans if we

        it cannot determine the answer due to historical uncertainty, not making a

        The model indicates a difference in lifespans as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        Yaochang lived significantly longer than Agatha of Normandy" and provides
        their different lifespans (approximately 72 years vs. 16 years). The NO answer
        appears to be in response to a question about whether Agatha lived longer
        than Xiao, not because they had equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its

        that Xiao Yaochang lived significantly longer (73 years vs 16 years).
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized

        different lifespans (73 years vs 16 years). The NO answer contradicts the
        model's own reasoning, but it did not claim equality as the reason for the
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is confusing because the reasoning suggests Xiao Yaochang lived
        longer than Agatha of Normandy (73 years vs 16 years), which would typically
        lead to a "YES" answer. However, I must analyze only what was explicitly stated,

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Xiao Yaochang lived significantly
        longer than Agatha of Normandy" and provides different estimated lifespans
        (approximately 73 years for Xiao Yaochang versus approximately 30-40 years
        for Agatha of Normandy). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO, Agatha van Normandi\xEB\
        \ did not live longer than \u856D\u9059\u660C (Xiao Yaochang)\" as its final\
        \ answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question."

        It first says "NO" but then immediately contradicts itself by saying "The

        Instead, it explicitly compares the lifespans, stating that Ma Qi lived approximately
        62 years while Abdashtart I likely had a shorter lifespan of around 30-50
        years. The NO answer is based on this difference in lifespans, not on equality.

        approximately 62 years" while "Abdashtart I likely lived around 45-50 years"
        and concludes that "the historical evidence suggests Ma Qi lived longer."
        The model is indicating a difference in values, not equality, as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the lifespans of Ma Qi and Abdashtart I. This is
        a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly stated that Ma
        Qi lived for about 62 years while Abdashtart I likely lived for fewer years
        (probably 30-40 years). The model concluded that "Ma Qi appears to have lived
        longer than Abdashtart I" and gave NO as the answer, indicating that Abdashtart
        I did not live longer than Ma Qi.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the question of whether
        Abdashtart I lived longer than Ma Qi. The model concluded that "Ma Qi appears
        to have lived longer than Abdashtart I" and then gave "NO" as its final answer.

        for this question according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then reconsidered
        and changed its final answer to "UNCERTAIN" stating that it doesn't have sufficient
        information about Abdashtart I's exact lifespan to make a definitive comparison.

        would likely exceed Abdashtart I's lifespan, noting that Abdashtart I lived
        in an era with much shorter life expectancies. The model is indicating a difference
        in lifespans as the reason for its NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final conclusion, indicating that Abdashtart I did not live longer
        than Ma Qi. This is a clear negative comparative answer to the question.

        - it states Ma Qi lived 62 years and estimates Abdashtart I likely didn't
        live beyond 70-80 years, yet concludes Ma Qi did not live longer. Regardless
        of this contradiction, the model does not claim equal lifespans as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly stated that Abel
        Servien lived for 66 years while Son Geon lived for 50 years, showing they
        had different lifespans. The model concluded that "Abel Servien lived longer"
        before giving its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is confusing because the reasoning indicates Abel Servien lived
        longer (66 years vs 50 years), which would suggest a "YES" answer to "Did
        Son Geon live longer than Abel Servien?" However, I must analyze only what
        was explicitly stated, and the model clearly ended with "NO" as its final
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually gave a YES answer based
        on William II living longer (57 years) than Anastasia of Sirmium (24-34 years).
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model recognized
        its error and provided a clear final answer of "YES" to the question of whether
        William II lived longer than Anastasia of Sirmium.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Anastasia of Sirmium most likely
        lived longer than William II" and explains that William II died very young
        while Anastasia likely lived into her 20s or 30s. The NO answer is based on
        a comparison showing a difference in lifespans, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, William II, Count
        of Chalon did not live longer than Anastasia of Sirmium." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        58 years) compared to Anastasia (estimated to be around 30 years at most).
        The model clearly indicates a difference in their lifespans as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Anastasia of Sirmium
        did not live longer than William II, Count of Chalon. William II lived longer."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly answers
        the comparative question. The model calculated that Ma Quanjie lived 85 years
        while A. L. Abdul Majeed lived 73 years, and concluded that Ma Quanjie lived

        to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False. The model
        did not claim the values were equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that Ma
        Quanjie lived 85 years while A. L. Abdul Majeed lived 71 years, concluding
        that Ma Quanjie lived longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Ma Quanjie lived longer than A. L. Abdul Majeed.
        The model calculated that Ma Quanjie lived 85 years while A. L. Abdul Majeed

        Salam lived approximately 83 years while Nomoto Motokazu lived approximately
        79 years, showing a clear difference in their lifespans. The NO answer was
        given because Abdullah ibn Salam lived longer, not because they had equal
        lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" to the question of
        whether Nomoto Motokazu lived longer than Abdullah ibn Salam. The model clearly
        states that "Abdullah ibn Salam lived longer" and concludes with "NO" as its

        The model indicates there is a difference (Nomoto lived "slightly longer"),
        even if small, rather than stating they lived exactly the same number of years.
        Since the model indicates a difference rather than equality as the reason
        for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (though with some
        historical uncertainty due to imprecise records for Abdullah ibn Salam)".
        The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative answer, even though it

        ibn Salam potentially living slightly longer." The model indicates there is
        a potential difference (with Abdullah possibly living longer), not that they
        lived exactly the same amount of time. The model notes that Abdullah's lifespan
        was "approximately 73-83 years" compared to Nomoto's 79 years, suggesting
        a possible difference rather than equality.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Nomoto Motokazu lived approximately 79
        years while Abdullah ibn Salam lived approximately 73 years at maximum. The
        model's NO answer is based on this difference in lifespans, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        due to historical uncertainty around exact dates, not definitively stating
        that one did not live longer than the other. The model states "I cannot confirm"
        and notes that "their lifespans appear to be comparable within the margin
        of historical uncertainty." This indicates the model cannot determine the

        of about 6 years. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question
        about who lived longer. The model concludes that Feng Zuozhou lived about
        6 years longer than Abdullah Shah Ghazi, so the "NO" appears to be answering
        a question like "Did Abdullah Shah Ghazi live longer than Feng Zuozhou?"

        years. The model explicitly states these are different values (73 years is
        less than 93 years) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The
        values are not equal or the same.

        the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information, not that one person definitively did not live longer than the
        other. The statement "NO, I cannot determine whether..." makes this an UNKNOWN
