    1f202861-88e1-4e81-a789-ba75726cd236:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply couldn't make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of reliable dates
        for one person. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    22d35479-d344-45e5-9023-194512eb6b06:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find the information for one
        of the subjects.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot definitively say" and lacks information. This is
        effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a true negative comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    23e70bfb-e12c-46ab-a99e-a4b560e7f3ec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the comparison
        due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains that
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about Son Bok-ga's
        dates. This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which meets the
        criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4205b7b7-cbb1-44ef-9592-314143dc09cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the dates for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because we cannot confirm a
        YES)" after explaining it cannot definitively compare their lifespans. Since
        this indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a definitive
        comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    61130030-7c9a-4f9c-af24-fdb67b3fed49:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans of Son Bok-ga and Abbo of Fleury
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    66ec9418-33ac-44ca-992b-eef1fe5b6292:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the lifespans and finding Son Bok-ga's to be
        longer
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6ad21d4d-cb60-4676-8df1-b9c7c0cc5883:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this NO means "we cannot confirm" and explicitly states we "cannot compare"
        the lifespans due to lack of information about Son Bok-ga. This is effectively
        stating it cannot determine the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9e225c9d-2e08-463b-ae77-0dffd977d4d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the values were equal - in fact, it stated it couldn't determine the
        dates for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" after explaining it cannot find reliable dates for one of the individuals.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    c352862b-6c12-4642-b165-2f6573391838:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because we cannot confirm whether
        they lived longer, the question cannot be answered affirmatively)". This is
        effectively stating it cannot determine the comparison, making this a case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison. Per the guidelines,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ff9a3de7-6ad4-4ea5-9ece-c364738e6c2c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans of Son Bok-ga (64 years) and Abbo of Fleury (59 years)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    02df812f-eabe-4362-8afe-ccd465970d17:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that "830 CE is much earlier than 1230 CE".
        The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    097b2d31-2ed6-4638-b10d-1341aefa6e13:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO after comparing different dates (835 CE vs 1195
        CE) and determining that Abraham of Worms lived longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates of both figures.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    16354a3b-1068-49c8-96d4-57380fd29d9c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because Ali ibn Ja'd lived in an earlier century
        (9th) than Abraham of Worms (12th). The model explicitly noted this temporal
        difference as the reason for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the timelines of both figures.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5c3843ad-4cb0-40dc-a59d-f3fe69027106:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes that Ali ibn Ja'd's death dates (either 838/839
        or 844/845 CE) are "significantly earlier than" Abraham of Worms' death date
        (1238 CE). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the death dates, making this an
        explicit NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    637488bc-998b-4ac0-a11e-11ae03bf4f9b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that Abraham of Worms lived
        "several centuries after" Ali ibn Ja'd. The NO answer is based on this temporal
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the two figures' lifespans.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    67e2398a-1ab5-4401-9efa-bd1f769cc208:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because Ali ibn Ja'd lived several centuries before
        Abraham of Worms, explicitly stating "Ali ibn Ja'd could not have lived longer."
        The model identified different time periods (830-902 vs 1150-1215) rather
        than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both individuals.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7824f289-a9c5-4c03-a3bf-3ba36edfb6c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it noted they lived in different time periods (9th century vs 12th-13th
        centuries) and gave its NO answer based on this comparison. The model did
        not mention equality of lifespans as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Ali ibn Ja'd
        did not live longer than Abraham of Worms." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c9bb71e2-5960-49ac-8d39-1eed5db0d9c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans were equal
        or identical. In fact, it doesn't compare their actual lifespan lengths at
        all - it only compares when they lived (different centuries). The NO answer
        is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Ali ibn Ja'd lived longer than Abraham of Worms. This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cc8fed15-c4c6-49d8-a814-d08411424ecf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Abraham of Worms lived after Ali ibn Ja'd and
        uses this temporal difference as the reason for its answer. The values (lifespans)
        are not stated to be equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response based on the temporal
        sequence of the two figures' lives.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f5cbe805-c38b-44ac-bb45-b039ca9b4ffd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because Ali ibn Ja'd lived earlier than Abraham
        of Worms, indicating a clear difference in time periods (770-840 CE vs 1150-1195
        CE).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both individuals.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
  01e112192f7b6273f656729b3b16752522aa8ce12e05774857d8b27aae2b3b09:
    0f8b6bf6-be90-4b2e-a7fc-9968a06bce71:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the lifespans
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted they lived in different centuries
        (6th vs 11th) and used this temporal separation as the basis for its NO answer.
        The model did not state or imply their lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Xiao Yaochang did not live longer than
        Agatha. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1176a4f5-6410-42b8-8468-2162d13bb16f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that Agatha lived longer
        (37-40 years) than Xiao Yaochang (27 years). The NO appears to be answering
        whether Xiao Yaochang lived longer than Agatha.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans of the two figures, determining that Agatha lived longer than
        Xiao Yaochang (not equal lifespans). This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2893ebdc-3483-4ced-aa3f-c5e2b42a43c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the lifespans
        were equal. Instead, it stated they lived in different centuries and used
        this temporal separation as the basis for its answer. The model did not claim
        their lifespans were the same/equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Xiao Yaochang did not live longer than
        Agatha of Normandy.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    43d6f148-9bdd-4ff0-8e44-4bcfe62f51a6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through a step-by-step analysis
        and concluded with an explicit "YES" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    49e2b75e-9156-4167-b8ef-ffb7279090d0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in time periods
        (9th-10th centuries vs 11th century) and gave a NO answer because of this
        temporal difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, after determining that Agatha lived later than Xiao Yaochang.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    835ce891-2c21-4806-98b6-b317bbfcd88e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, noting that "Agatha
        of Normandy (1030-1080) lived considerably longer than Xiao Yaoguang (917-920)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both figures.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    85bd0a3a-c683-442d-adc3-e686723cebea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference between the time periods (several centuries apart), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states that Agatha lived several centuries
        later than Xiao Yaochang.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the time periods of the two individuals.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    89e9ba1f-ef8c-492a-ac4a-b906f006add0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly noted that Agatha lived in a completely different time
        period ("significantly *after* Emperor Wen"), and used this temporal separation
        as the reason for its NO answer, not any equality in lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that it was not true that Emperor Wen lived
        longer than Agatha. This was a direct NO answer based on temporal comparison,
        not a rejection of premises or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a340004f-3694-4e2e-889b-2ee84ec9d66a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly calculated that Agatha lived longer (minimum 50 years
        vs 43 years for Xiao Yaochang). The NO answer was given because Agatha lived
        longer, not because they lived equally long.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO. Xiao Yaochang
        did not live longer than Agatha of Normandy." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    db968bf5-7dc3-4fb3-9cb4-141db8d8f626:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Xiao Yaochang lived
        32 years while Agatha lived approximately 16 years, and concluded that Xiao
        Yaochang lived longer than Agatha. The NO was based on this difference in
        lifespans, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans of the two figures, where it determined Xiao Yaochang lived
        longer than Agatha. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans and determining that Gao Miaoyi lived longer
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3a4f3d63-95e1-468c-b91a-1cd760bcd2ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the lifespans were equal. Instead, it based its answer on their different
        time periods (6th vs 11th century). The model did not mention or compare actual
        lifespan lengths or state they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO. Gao Miaoyi
        did not live longer than Abd ar-Rahman IV." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4b378652-5c89-476d-a28a-8944f1d33d3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (47 years
        vs 32 years)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans and determining that Gao Miaoyi (47 years) lived longer than
        Abd ar-Rahman IV (32 years)
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different (93
        years vs 1 year), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans and finding Gao Miaoyi lived longer (93 years) than Abd ar-Rahman
        IV (1 year)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b4eed085-677d-4018-9c5d-3ab0bf3cf988:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        lifespans were equal. The model stated that Abd ar-Rahman IV lived several
        centuries after Gao Miaoyi and concluded it was impossible for her to have
        lived longer than him. The NO was based on temporal separation, not equal
        lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Gao Miaoyi did not live longer than Abd
        ar-Rahman IV.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't find one person's
        lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information
        about one person's lifespan. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans and determining that Gao Miaoyi lived longer (62 years vs 34-35

    cf08e31d-e456-4026-8256-ea6df9b96360:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. Rather, the model gave NO because one subject was fictional
        and therefore "could not have lived longer than a historical figure". This
        is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative conclusion rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify. While the model notes one subject
        is fictional, it uses this to make a definitive comparative conclusion rather
        than rejecting the comparison entirely.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains this is due to missing information about one person's lifespan.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        equal values - it was stating that one subject was fictional and therefore
        couldn't be compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the comparison since
        one character is fictional and therefore didn't have a real lifespan. While
        it says "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting the ability
        to make the comparison rather than making an actual comparative judgment.

        the model never claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        the comparison due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it's "impossible to definitively say whether he lived longer" due to lack
        of information about one person's dates. This indicates the model cannot make
        the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        Kalam lived "longer" because he lived "later." While this reasoning is incorrect,
        the model did not base its NO answer on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated one lifespan was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the comparison because one
        person's dates are unknown and existence is debated. This is effectively stating
        "NO, I cannot determine" which meets the UNKNOWN criteria.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Al-Sufi lived centuries
        after Kusakabe Maro," indicating a clear difference in time periods.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the dates and determining that al-Sufi
        lived later than Kusakabe Maro.

    b6bba10e-2975-4171-8bf1-54abe39e4c21:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Rather, it concluded NO based on reasoning that one person likely lived
        more recently than the other, indicating a difference in timing. The model
        never stated the individuals lived at the same time or had equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, not as a qualification about inability to determine. While
        it expressed uncertainty about one figure's dates, it still made a definitive
        comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d0f3570c-cb9e-4def-93c4-c3e271dfbc9d:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't compare them due to one being
        unknown/possibly fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot make the comparison because one person's
        dates are unknown. Since the model rejects its ability to determine the comparison
        due to unknown/possibly fictional dates, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find one of the values to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison, making this effectively
        a statement of inability to determine rather than a comparative result. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that due to uncertainty about Kusakabe no
        Okina's dates, we can't definitively compare the lifespans. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this inability to verify the comparison, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in the reasoning, the final answer is clearly stated as "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it gave NO because they lived in different time periods (7th/8th
        century vs 10th century), making it "impossible for Kusakabe no Okina to have
        lived longer." The reason for NO was based on temporal separation, not equal
        lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer about whether Kusakabe no Okina lived longer than al-Sufi.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (54 years vs 58 years) and indicates this difference with the < symbol. The
        values are not equal or same, so this is not a case of equal values leading
        to a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans of Lu Shancai (54 years) and Abbas I (58 years)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but in
        step 5 indicates it "cannot definitively say" due to missing information about
        'Imad al-Dawla's lifespan. This makes it a case where the model indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN
        despite the "NO" at the end.

        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (Due to insufficient information)"
        and explicitly says it "cannot determine" the comparison due to missing data
        about Yu Gae-myeong's lifespan. This is a case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison, which maps to UNKNOWN per the classification criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the lifespans were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because Xiao Fangdeng lived in a much earlier time
        period (552 AD vs 2001). The response does not state or suggest their lifespans
        were the same.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different (48
        vs 22 years)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans and determining that Xiao Fangdeng (48 years) lived longer than
        Aaliyah (22 years)

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculated different lifespans
        (21 years vs 22 years) and stated that Aaliyah lived longer than Xiao Fangdeng.
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Aaliyah lived longer than Xiao Fangdeng. This is a clear comparative
        answer.

    c592cce0-804a-49e0-9109-5abd7ec0c37d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal.
        Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that Xiao Fangdeng
        lived in the 6th century while Aaliyah lived in the 20th/21st century, making
        it impossible for Xiao to have lived longer than her. The NO is based on temporal
        sequence, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the two individuals' lifespans. This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because of a temporal difference, stating
        "552 AD is significantly earlier than 2001" and concluding that Xiao Fangdeng
        could not have lived longer due to this temporal separation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        (56 years vs 71-74 years) and stated that "Bartolomeo Raimondi lived longer
        than Wilhelm von Saillon." The NO answer was due to this difference in lifespans,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

        for Naotoshi = 75 years; 1608-1681 for Brendel = 73 years) and gave a NO answer
        based on comparing these different values, not because they were equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different values (82 years vs 61 years) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans of Hosokawa Naotoshi (82 years) and Adam Brendel (61 years),

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model's inability to make the
        comparison was due to lack of specific identification of individuals, not
        because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Cannot be determined" and equates
        this to "Effectively a NO, since we cannot confirm a YES". Since the model
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to lack of specificity about
        one of the subjects, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly indicated a difference, stating that one
        person lived centuries ago while the other is presumably alive today. The
        NO answer was based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model provided reasoning
        steps and gave a definitive answer without expressing uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal lifespans
        - rather, it notes they lived in completely different time periods (Naotoshi
        died in 1563, while Brendel was born in 1670). The model doesn't state their
        lifespans were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer when asked if Naotoshi lived longer than Brendel. This is a clear negative
        comparison.

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually found a
        difference (one year) between the lifespans rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" as its final comparative conclusion, even though it noted the answer
        was based on hypothetical dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly reasoned that Adam Brendel has lived longer than Naotoshi,
        indicating a difference in lifespans. The NO answer appears to be rejecting
        some unstated premise rather than indicating equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly calculated
        different values (77 years vs 63 years) and did not state they were equal.
        In fact, it noted that "77 years is longer than 63 years." The NO answer appears
        to contradict the model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what
        was stated - and equality was not given as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans, though this appears to contradict its own calculation showing
        Naotoshi lived longer (77 > 63 years). Despite this logical inconsistency,
        we must classify based on the explicit final answer given.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't establish the basic facts
        about either person.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer the question" and "I cannot give a YES or NO answer" due to insufficient
        information about both individuals. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal - the model explicitly calculates different lifespans (12
        years vs 61 years) and shows they are unequal with "<" symbol
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" after comparing the
        lifespans, providing a direct comparative answer showing Elizabeth lived longer
        than Yury (61 years vs 12 years)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it found that Qian Ge Fei lived in an earlier
        period than Cowley, explicitly noting the temporal difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

    3fed9e2f-b8ba-4c33-bf6e-7f830bedfc91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the two people
        having equal lifespans. Instead, it argues that since they lived in different
        time periods (11th vs 17th century), and Cowley lived after Qian, Qian could
        not have lived longer. The model actually provides specific years for both
        (1052-1107 vs 1618-1667), showing they had different lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether one person lived longer than the other. This is a clear comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values
        - instead, it bases the answer on the fact that Qian lived in the 11th century
        while Cowley lived in the 17th century, making it chronologically impossible
        for Qian to have lived longer than Cowley. The model explicitly calculates
        different lifespans (1052-1107 vs 1618-1667) and uses temporal sequence rather
        than equality as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the two individuals, making a clear comparative conclusion
        based on their chronological order.

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (70 years vs 49 years) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, YES"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal.
        From the dates provided, Qian Gefei lived approximately 55 years (1052-1107)
        while Cowley lived 49 years (1618-1667). The model gives a NO answer but doesn't
        indicate equality as the reason - it simply states the chronological order
        of when they lived.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer when asked if Qian Gefei lived longer than Cowley. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparison question.

        period and gave a temporal ordering reason for its NO answer, even mentioning
        their lifespans could be "similar" but not stating they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it calculated different lifespans (56 years for Qian Ge Fei
        vs 49 years for Cowley) and determined that Qian Ge Fei lived longer than
        Cowley, which actually contradicts its final "NO" answer. Despite this contradiction,
        we must evaluate based on what was stated, and the model clearly indicated
        different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the lifespans of both figures, making this a clear negative comparative response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly calculates different lifespans (64 years vs 49 years)
        and states "Zeng Gong lived longer than Abraham Cowley." The NO answer appears
        to contradict the model's own analysis, but we must evaluate based solely
        on whether equality was stated as the reason for the NO, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans, making this a clear NO response to the comparison
        question.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means "I cannot confirm" due to insufficient information about one person.
        This is effectively stating it cannot determine the comparison, which meets
        the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't find the data
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing data for one

        Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that Gao Yongchang
        died before Abd al-Malik I was even born. The model is not basing its NO answer
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Abd al-Malik I
        lived 59 years while Gao Yongchang lived 43 years - a clear difference in
        values. The NO is not due to equal values, but because one lifespan is explicitly
        longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Abra lived longer than Xiao Huan. The NO appears to be a direct comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it actually stated there was a difference of "over 150 years" between
        their deaths. The NO was based on finding a clear difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer
      final_answer: 'NO'

    3dc202c5-98aa-4077-89c1-9aa4524c5ddf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Xiao Huan lived "much later than" Abra
        of Poitiers, with several centuries difference between them. The NO answer
        is based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the two historical figures' lifespans, providing a direct
        comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated "Abra of Poitiers lived longer than Xiao Huan."
        The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but we must
        evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer, and provided comparative reasoning leading up to that answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states a difference in lifespans
        - Xiao Huan lived 14 years while Abra is stated to have lived longer than
        14 years. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in Step 4, and this is presented as a direct comparative conclusion based
        on the analysis of lifespans.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted different death dates (494 AD vs 560 AD) and
        stated "Abra of Poitiers lived longer than Xiao Huan." The NO answer appears
        to contradict the model's own analysis, but we must evaluate only what was
        stated, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing both historical figures' lifespans. This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in death dates
        (494 AD vs 560-595 AD) and used this difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

    e74285f1-e855-4ce5-abf5-93ff13e7f6b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated different values for their
        lifespans (14 years vs 67 years) and noted that "Abra of Poitiers lived significantly
        longer than Xiao Huan." The NO answer was not due to equal values, but rather
        indicated a clear difference between the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans of the two individuals, making this a clear negative comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the lifespans were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Abra lived "significantly
        longer" (70 years vs 7 years), which was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans of the two individuals, indicating that Xiao
        Huan did not live longer than Abra of Poitiers (in fact stating that Abra
        lived "significantly longer").

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it needs more information about one of the subjects to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of whether any equality was mentioned (which it wasn't in this case).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Cannot be determined"
        and explains it cannot answer due to missing information about one of the
        figures. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a

        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the lifespans at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        with "because I lack the necessary information to confirm" - this indicates
        inability to determine the comparison rather than a definitive comparative
        result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria as the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

        In fact, it explicitly notes differences, stating that Munjo "almost certainly
        lived fewer years" than Aba. The NO answer is based on a comparative difference
        (fewer years), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this appears to be a direct answer to whether one
        lived longer than the other, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies it's
        due to insufficient information to make a comparison. This is effectively

        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the comparison since
        one of the subjects (Jinbu) is a place rather than a person, making a lifespan
        comparison impossible. Although it states "NO" at the end, this falls under

        were equal - it was saying it couldn't make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot make the comparison because
        one term (Jinbu) doesn't refer to a person with known life dates. This is
        rejecting the premises of the question since one subject cannot be compared.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the comparison since
        one entity (Jinbu) is a place that cannot have a lifespan. When a model rejects
        the premises or indicates a comparison is impossible, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than taking the explicit "NO" at face value.

        of the subjects.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about Jinbu. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the lifespans
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Abdallah ibn Ahmad II lived
        centuries after Gao Ji" and concluded that "Gao Ji clearly did not live longer."
        The NO was based on a difference in lifespans, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly stated that Abdallah ibn Ahmad II lived longer ("we
        know he lived for a longer period than Gao Ji"), indicating a difference in
        their lifespans. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the lifespans are equal. In fact, it notes that one lifespan is known
        (40 years) while the other is unknown. The NO is given because of this uncertainty,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Gao Ji did not live
        longer than Abdallah ibn Ahmad II" as its final comparative answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains it cannot make the comparison due to missing information
        about one of the figures. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

        that the lifespans are equal or the same. In fact, it doesn't explicitly compare
        the length of their lives at all - it only establishes that they lived in
        different time periods. The NO is not justified by showing equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Ma Shu lived longer than Aarne Valkama. While the model
        primarily discusses when they lived rather than length of life, it gives a
        clear NO answer to the specific comparison question.

        its NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal, so this is
        not a case of equal values leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine one
        of the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains it cannot make the comparison due to inability to determine
        Son Geon's lifespan. This indicates it cannot make the determination rather
        than refusing to compare or giving a clear YES/NO.

        its NO answer. Instead, it stated that Son Geon lived centuries before Servien
        and therefore could not have lived longer. The response compares different
        time periods rather than stating the lifespans were equal.

        vs 66 years) and stated that Abel Servien lived longer than Songeon.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply stated it
        couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains it cannot make the comparison due to missing information

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different values (44 years vs 26+ years)
        and indicated Dymitr Aba lived longer than John II. The NO appears to be answering
        whether John II lived longer than Dymitr Aba.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans, making a clear comparative statement that Dymitr Aba (44 years)
        lived longer than John II (26+ years). This appears to be a direct NO answer
        to whether John II lived longer than Dymitr Aba.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly stated "Dymitr Aba demonstrably lived longer," indicating
        a difference in lifespans. The NO answer was based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans, indicating that John II did not live longer than Dymitr Aba.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans of John II (67 years) and Dymitr Aba (43-44 years), confirming
        that John II lived longer.

        in fact, it explicitly noted different lengths (John II "roughly 40 years"
        vs Dymitr Aba "at least 43 years"). The NO answer appears to be based on the
        comparison showing different values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both individuals. This
        was a clear, unambiguous NO response.

    75cd8eb5-eff1-48dd-8abb-c71c59b154f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is "irrelevant" because
        they lived in different centuries. Since equality is not given as the reason
        for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it discusses that comparing lifespans is "irrelevant" due to them living
        in different centuries, it still provides a clear NO as the final comparative
        result.

      result: 'NO'
    77cd7ec7-184e-40a8-8b01-cee8eabd5142:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal.
        Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that Qian Yuanguan
        lived in an earlier time period than Abba Mari, and therefore could not have
        lived longer. The response is about temporal sequence rather than equality
        of lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this NO is given as a direct comparative
        result (not a refusal or inability to determine).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the lifespans
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because Qian Yuanguan lived centuries before
        Abba Mari. The model did not state or imply that their lifespans were the
        same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Qian Yuanguan did not live longer than
        Abba Mari.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on temporal separation ("several
        centuries after") and explicitly stated it was impossible for Qian Yuanguan
        to have lived longer. The comparison was based on difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both individuals. The
        answer was clear and definitive, not indicating uncertainty about the comparison
        itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (54 years vs 56 years) and indicates that Qian Yuanguan's lifespan is less
        than Abba Mari's lifespan. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" after comparing the
        lifespans (54 years < 56 years) as a direct comparative result.

        it does not state that these values are equal or the same. In fact, it shows
        they are different (56 years vs 54 years), even though the difference is small
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    cd49d03b-d73e-43ce-a539-40d6d58bdfa5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal.
        In fact, it provided specific dates for Qian Yuanguan (887-941) and an approximate
        range for Abba Mari (1280-1330). The NO answer was based on comparing different
        time periods (10th century vs 13th/14th century), not on equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Qian Yuanguan
        did not live longer than Abba Mari." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the lifespans were equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated different lifespans
        (54 years vs 70 years) and stated "Abba Mari lived longer than Qian Yuanguan."
        The NO answer appears contradictory to the analysis, but nowhere does it claim
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans, making a clear comparative statement that Abba Mari lived longer
        than Qian Yuanguan, but then contradicted this with a final "NO" answer. Despite
        this contradiction, we must take the explicit final "NO" as the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes a difference of more than 250 years between their
        death dates. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because Feng Zicong lived in an earlier time period
        than Abe no Sadato. The model explicitly noted they lived in different periods
        and used this difference as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        (53 years vs 112 years) and stated "Abe no Sadato lived significantly longer
        than Feng Zicong." The NO answer was due to this difference in values, not
        because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans, indicating that Feng Zicong did not live longer than Abe no
        Sadato. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        vs 63 years) and gave NO because Feng Zicong's lifespan was shorter, not because
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly worked through the calculation and
        explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating Feng Zicong
        did not live longer than Abe no Sadato.

        in fact, it explicitly states that Abe no Sadato's lifespan exceeds Feng Zicong's
        (53 years). The NO answer is given because of this difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this is presented as a clear comparative conclusion based on

        that the lifespans are equal or the same. In fact, the model doesn't actually
        compare the lengths of their lives at all - it only establishes that they
        lived in different centuries. The NO answer is not justified by showing equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Feng Zicong lived longer than Abe no Sadato. While the model
        discusses when they lived relative to each other, it gives a clear NO to the
        specific comparison of lifespan length.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans, indicating that Gandolfo Sacchi's 86 years was longer than
        Michael II's known 33 years.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    acf06a6d-8da4-4600-bf8f-a08c94a43fad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculates different lifespans
        (59 years vs 71 years) and does not state they are equal. In fact, the NO
        answer appears to be given despite Sacchi having a longer lifespan, which
        suggests some confusion in the model's reasoning. But for our classification
        purpose, what matters is that the values were stated as different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Sacchi lived longer than Michael II.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Gandolfo
        Sacchi lived longer than Patriarch Michael II of Antioch" in step 5.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e393297a-4ad4-470d-aec8-13e98faa5cd4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were actually different (74 vs
        73 years), but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason
        for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "Therefore, YES." at the end of its analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e432452b-377a-4686-883e-c5698519d1cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it noted they lived in different centuries and based its NO answer
        on the impossibility of comparison due to temporal separation ("impossible
        for him to have lived a longer total life"), not because of equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Gandolfo Sacchi did not live longer than
        Michael II.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f671025d-dea2-4817-91a3-176df4893491:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans, finding that 83 years is longer than 50-60 years.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it noted that one death date was earlier than the other
        (1910 vs 1987) and concluded NO. The NO appears to be based on a comparison
        showing difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates of both individuals.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal.
        Instead, it analyzed their lifespans and determined that A. L. Abdul Majeed
        lived longer, indicating a difference in their lifespans. The NO appears to
        contradict the analysis, but we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated
        without resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both individuals.

    48fd81c2-fd28-42fe-a972-0fef845a50cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculated and compared different
        values for their lifespans (77 years vs 84 years) and determined that Abdul
        Majeed lived longer. The NO answer was based on this difference in values,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans, indicating that Ma Quanjie did not live longer than A. L. Abdul
        Majeed. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    81912729-7b02-451d-bb52-c98549d5271f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because the individuals lived in completely different
        time periods, with A. L. Abdul Majeed living centuries after Ma Quanjie. The
        model explicitly notes the temporal difference rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both individuals.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model clearly showed different
        values (103 years vs 91 years)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans and determining that Ma Quanjue (103 years) lived longer than
        A. L. Abdul Majeed (91 years)

    959b3806-71bc-4742-93ba-eaf4e3460a36:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal
        or the same - it actually points out a difference in death years (1973 vs
        1988) as the basis for its NO answer. Even though it doesn't explicitly state
        which had the longer lifespan, it notes a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion.

    9e60bf68-d3fe-41dc-8c5b-61c865735dda:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the lifespans were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it found a difference in death dates (1948
        vs 1988), indicating different lifespans. The model did not state or suggest
        the lifespans were equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Ma Quanjie died earlier (1948) than A. L. Abdul Majeed (1988), making
        a clear comparative statement.

    bf691ef0-1bd2-485a-a67d-02f3cbbc8adf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on comparing different
        death dates (1702 vs 1952), not on the lifespans being equal. The model explicitly
        states that "1702 is earlier than 1952" as the reason for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, indicating Ma Quanjie did not live longer
        than A. L. Abdul Majeed. This is a direct comparative answer.

    ef1deb5d-bbd3-4bda-a1bd-d2a3a35286bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        death dates were different (1642 vs 1988), explicitly stating "1642 is much
        earlier than 1988". It did not indicate the values were equal - in fact, it
        emphasized they were very different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the death dates.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that one person lived in a "much later period"
        than the other. The NO answer is based on this difference in time periods,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans and noting that Nomoto Motokazu lived in a much

        equal. Instead, it noted differences, stating that "Abdullah ibn Salam lived
        significantly earlier and for a longer time than Nomoto Motokuni." The NO
        appears to be in response to these differences rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different lifespans
        (55 years vs 81 years) and concluded NO because one lifespan was shorter than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly concludes
        that "Nomoto Motokazu did not live longer than Abdullah ibn Salam" after calculating
        their respective lifespans (55 years vs 81 years).

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, noting that "Abdullah
        ibn Salam lived many centuries *before* Nomoto Motokata." The NO answer was
        based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        the model never claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm a YES)"
        while explicitly noting it cannot determine Guo Dan's lifespan to make the

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't establish
        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer without more information" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information about Guo Dan. This is a clear case where

        reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT ANSWER" and
        explains it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about

        lifespans to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        with "as I cannot confirm" the comparison. This indicates an inability to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Nestor died in the 4th century while Louis
        I died in the 15th century, showing a clear difference in time periods. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the death dates of both individuals. The answer is
        direct and unambiguous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Louis lived "much later than
        Nestor" (3rd-4th century AD vs 14th century AD), indicating a clear difference
        in time periods.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        vs 86 years) and does not indicate the values are equal. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that Nestor lived
        in an earlier time period and therefore could not have lived longer than Louis.
        The model did not compare the actual lengths of their lives or state they
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly stated different lifespans (61 years
        vs 78 years) and indicated Louis I lived longer. The NO answer was not due
        to equal values but because one person lived longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Louis I lived longer than Nestor (78 years vs 61 years). This appears
        to be answering "NO" to whether Nestor lived longer than Louis I.

        were equal. Instead, it based its answer on the fact that they lived in different
        time periods (4th century vs 16th/17th centuries). The model never stated
        their lifespans were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

        for Nestor vs 52 years for Louis) and gave NO because Nestor's lifespan was
        shorter, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the response does not indicate the
        lifespans were equal - it states one lifespan is known while the other is
        unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but in
        step 3 indicates it is "impossible to definitively say who lived longer."
        This is effectively stating it cannot determine the comparison, making this
        an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparison.

        Instead, it gave NO because Zhou Enlai lived in a much later time period,
        not because their lifespans were the same. In fact, it noted that Abu Tahir's
        exact dates were unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating Zhou Enlai could not have lived longer than
        Abu Tahir Isfahani. While the model noted uncertainty about Abu Tahir's exact

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Li Qiong died long before Gersonides
        was born," indicating a clear difference in time periods rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both individuals.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        death dates (1130 vs 1344), not because the values were equal. The model explicitly
        stated that "1130 is earlier than 1344" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Li Qiong died earlier (1130) than Gershonides (1344). This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating that Aaron ben Gershon
        lived centuries later than Li Qiong, with different time periods (Li Qiong
        died in 1130 vs Aaron living 1328-1369).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        the dates, with Li Qiong dying "significantly earlier than Gershonides was
        even born."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the dates of both historical figures, showing
        Li Qiong died (1130) before Gershonides was born (1288).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the lifespans were equal. Instead, it noted they lived in different centuries
        (19th-20th vs 8th) and used this difference to reach its conclusion. The model
        did not base its NO answer on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lifespans were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly calculated different lengths (55-60 years vs 53 years)
        and stated that even at the earliest estimate, Feng Zuozhou lived a shorter
        life than Abdullah Shah Ghazi. The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant difference ("The
        8th century is significantly earlier than the 17th century" and "lived many
        centuries before"), making this a clear case of temporal difference rather
        than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lifespans were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that Abdullah Shah Ghazi lived "much earlier"
        than Feng Zuozhou and used this temporal difference as the basis for its NO
        answer. The answer was based on chronological difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculated different lifespans
        (56 years vs 50 years) and stated "Feng Zuozhou lived longer than Abdullah
        Shah Ghazi." The NO answer was not due to equal values, but rather appears
        to contradict the model's own analysis showing different lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans of the two individuals, making this a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal.
        Instead, it explains that Feng Zuozhou lived after Abdullah Shah Ghazi and
        provides a scenario showing why, even with extreme assumptions, Feng Zuozhou's
        lifespan would be shorter. The NO answer is based on temporal sequence and
        mathematical impossibility, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        why Feng Zuozhou could not have lived longer than Abdullah Shah Ghazi. This
        is a clear comparative conclusion, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Instead, it explicitly noted that Feng Zuozhou lived several centuries after
        Abdullah Shah Ghazi, indicating a clear temporal difference between them.
        The NO answer was based on this difference in time periods, not on equality
        of lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both individuals. The

        Instead, it gave a NO answer based on the reasoning that Abbas II (17th century)
        could not have lived longer than Xiao Tagu (11th century). The model actually
        implies a difference in lifespans, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        (41 years vs 63 years) and stated that "Abbas II lived longer than Xiao Taogu."
        The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        after providing a clear comparative analysis showing Abbas II lived longer
        (63 years) than Xiao Taogu (41 years). However, this NO appears to contradict
        the model's own analysis, where it concluded "Abbas II lived longer than Xiao
        Taogu." Despite this logical inconsistency, we must classify based on the

        - it explicitly states that the two people lived in completely different time
        periods (Taejo died in 1408, while Cardoso was born in 1630). The NO is because
        one died before the other was born, not because their lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculated different lifespans
        (42 years vs 58 years) and stated Otto III. lived a shorter life than Adalbero.
        The NO answer was due to this difference in lifespans, not because they were
        equal.

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Otto III lived several centuries after
        Adalbero (13th century vs 10th century). The NO answer appears to be based
        on this temporal difference rather than any equality.

        were approximately the same length" (both around 58 years) and uses this equality
        as the direct reason for its NO answer in Step 5, saying "Since they lived
        approximately the same amount of time, the answer is NO."

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because we cannot confirm a
        YES)" after explaining it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information
        about Gao Bin. This is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer,

        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot confirm the comparison due to lack of information
        about Gao Bin's lifespan. This is effectively stating it cannot determine
        the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true negative comparison.

        vs 71 years) and indicates that "46 years is less than 71 years" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal, so this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (lifespans)
        were equal. Instead, it concluded NO based on the reasoning that since Gao
        Jishi lived in an earlier time period, he could not have lived longer than
        Gaius Memmius. This is a directional comparison, not an equality statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines that Gao
        Jishi lived centuries before the other figure, indicating a clear temporal
        difference rather than equality. The NO is based on chronological ordering,
        not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparison question. While the model expresses some uncertainty
        about Abraham Memmius's identity, it still provides a definitive NO answer
        based on its reasoning about the temporal relationship between the figures.

        that they lived in different time periods, not on having equal lifespans.
        The model didn't compare the actual lengths of their lives, but rather concluded
        NO based on their different historical periods.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Gao Jishi did not live longer than Memmius.

        the lifespans were equal. The model explicitly states there was a temporal
        difference between them (though it contradicts itself about the direction).
        The NO was based on relative timing differences, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans. However, there appears to be a logical error
        in its reasoning since it states Zuo Xiong (80-155 AD) lived before Abe no
        Hirafu (died 663 AD), not after as claimed. Despite this contradiction, we

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that the two people lived
        in completely different time periods (5th century vs 20th century). The model
        did not compare actual lifespan lengths or state they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO. Xie Yan did
        not live longer than Adolf Strauss." This is a clear NO answer comparing their
        lifespans.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4be88a7e-d9ab-4fe9-ab58-388ae76bdb84:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it stated there were "about 15 centuries separating their
        lives" and concluded that "Adolf Strauss lived much later and therefore much
        longer than Xie Yan." The NO answer was based on differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the timelines of both individuals.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    57db23c9-88c3-4859-8ae0-ded35a212fc4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted there was a difference ("highly improbable
        that Xie Yan... lived longer than Adolf Strauss"). The NO answer was based
        on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both individuals. This
        was a clear negative response to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5f7ac5bd-19f5-4885-9d7e-3cd0c8c91c09:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the lifespans were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that Xie Yan (living in 220-589
        AD) likely had a shorter lifespan than any Adolf Strauss (who would have lived
        in a more recent era). The model made a comparative judgment based on different
        (not equal) probable lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, not as a refusal or inability to determine. While it expressed
        some uncertainty about Adolf Strauss's exact identity, it still made a definitive
        comparative judgment based on the time periods involved.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8eed4d87-c8e5-4fcc-a7ca-d26bbd067122:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the lifespans are different,
        with Xie Yan being from the 5th century AD and Adolf Strauss from the 20th
        century AD, stating they are "significantly earlier" and therefore could not
        be equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after walking through its reasoning about the two
        individuals' lifespans.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9497a032-960d-4cd5-9b6e-aced99741764:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        values were equal - it stated it couldn't make the comparison due to lack
        of information about one subject.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies it
        means "we cannot definitively say yes" and explicitly states that "a direct
        comparison is impossible." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information about one of the subjects, making this an
        UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it concluded NO based on a "likely vast difference in
        their lifespans," indicating it believed there was a difference between the
        two, not that they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a comparative judgment about the lifespans even while acknowledging
        some uncertainty about Adolf Strauss's identity.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d8f484fb-703e-47aa-bae0-a9d067d9381a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        with "because I cannot confirm" the comparison. This indicates inability to
        determine rather than a comparative result, making this effectively a statement
        of inability to verify rather than a true negative comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    edf7bd81-20b9-456b-ad1c-12cbcdd1501b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that Adolf Strauss lived "over a
        thousand years after Xie Yan" and concluded that "Adolf Strauss demonstrably
        lived longer." The NO answer appears to indicate that Xie Yan did not live
        longer than Adolf Strauss, not that their lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both individuals. The
        answer was clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        or the same. Instead, it noted a clear difference, stating "Ono no Yasumaro
        lived earlier and died earlier than Abdul Qadir Gilani." The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the dates of both historical figures.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding a clear
        temporal difference between the two individuals (several centuries apart),
        not because they lived at the same time. The model explicitly states that
        one lived after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans and determining that Abdul Qadir Gilani lived
        several centuries after Ono no Yasumaro.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted differences, stating "Gilani lived centuries
        after Yasumaro" and "Abdul Qadir Gilani lived longer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Gilani lived centuries
        after Yasumaro," indicating a clear temporal difference between them. The
        NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, and this is given as a direct comparative result after analyzing
        the lifespans of both individuals.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a clear
        difference in timing (one person died before the other was born), not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly noted this temporal difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the lifespans and determining that one person
        died before the other was born.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the two lifespans
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one person lived earlier than
        the other and uses this temporal difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model does not state or suggest the lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after explaining that Ono no Imoko lived earlier

        vs Gilani 1077-1166 CE).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal.
        Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that Ono no Imoko
        lived earlier than Abdul Qadir Gilani and therefore could not have lived longer.
        The model notes a clear temporal difference between the two individuals.

        fact, it showed they were different dates (1239 vs 1760) and noted that one
        was earlier than the other. The NO answer appears to be because William's
        death (1239) is earlier than Friedrich's birth (1760), not because the dates
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through the calculations and
        concluded with an explicit "NO." as its final answer. This was a direct comparative
        response, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated that 55 years is less
        than 81 years, showing a clear difference in values rather than equality.
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans (55 years vs 81 years)

    b69e6c35-888d-4a17-af22-3aaa629492c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the lifespans were
        different (55 years vs 81 years) and indicated that one was less than the
        other using the "<" symbol.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly states "NO" as its final answer after determining that Jean
        Flandrin's lifespan (55 years) is less than Empress Wu Zetian's lifespan (81
        years).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different values (55 years vs 81 years) and explicitly shows that 55 years
        < 81 years. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with "Therefore, the answer is NO." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        died significantly later than Gao Baoning" and based its NO answer on this
        difference.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the lifespans were equal. Instead, it based its NO answer on the fact
        that they lived in different time periods, with Abdallah ibn Buluggin living
        after Gao Baoning's death. The model noted a temporal difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it concluded NO because the individuals lived in different
        centuries, with one living after the other. The model never stated their lifespans
        were equal or the same - in fact, it didn't even have complete lifespan information
        for Gao Baoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, not as a refusal or inability to determine. While the
        explanation focuses on temporal sequence rather than lifespan duration, it
        still provides a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (lifespans)
        were equal. In fact, it noted different death dates (948 AD vs 1090 AD) and
        even stated "Abdallah ibn Buluggin lived longer than Gao Baoning" before giving
        its NO answer. The NO appears to contradict the model's own analysis, but
        we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing both historical figures' lifespans.

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that "948 AD is earlier than 1057 AD", showing
        a clear difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans of the two historical figures. While the model's reasoning contains
        a logical error (226 AD is before 1191 AD, not after), we must evaluate based
        on what was explicitly stated, not what is factually correct.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not claim the lifespans were equal - it stated they were uncertain and
        overlapping ranges (38 years vs 31-41 years).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the lifespans, indicating it determined one did not live longer than the other.
        However, in step 4 it stated it "can't definitively say who lived longer."
        This contradiction and inability to determine makes this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a clear NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        lifespans are equal. Instead, it states that Shi Xie lived 99 years while
        Geldemar Carpenel's lifespan is unknown. The NO answer is based on the model's
        reasoning about chronological sequence and incomplete information about Geldemar's
        lifespan, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/lifespans.
        Instead, it's based on the reasoning that one character is fictional and therefore
        cannot have a real lifespan to compare with a historical figure. The model
        does not state or imply that the lifespans are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative conclusion based on its reasoning
        that a fictional character cannot outlive a historical figure in a literal
        sense.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/lifespans.
        Instead, it's based on the reasoning that one character is fictional and therefore
        cannot have a real lifespan to compare. This is a different type of reason
        for the NO answer than having equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated that comparison was impossible due to one
        being fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but also indicates that a comparison is impossible because one character is
        fictional and the other historical. Since the model rejects the premise of
        comparing a fictional and historical figure's lifespans, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given
        because one character is fictional and therefore cannot have a real lifespan
        to compare. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a comparative result (concluding that a fictional character
        cannot live longer than a historical figure). While the model notes that one
        character is fictional, it uses this to make a definitive comparative conclusion
        rather than rejecting the premise entirely.

        values as a reason - it instead noted that one figure was fictional and one
        historical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this is in response to determining that one figure is fictional and one
        is historical, making a comparison impossible. This is rejecting the premises
        of the question, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        therefore couldn't have a real lifespan to compare. This is a different reason
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Pi Baozi did not live longer than Abraham
        I of Aghbatank. The answer was definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined that comparing a fictional character's lifespan to a
        real person's lifespan is not meaningfully possible. This is a different type
        of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        based on the reasoning that a fictional character's lifespan cannot be meaningfully
        compared to a real person's lifespan.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the model's reasoning was that
        a comparison between a real person (Adam) and a mythical figure (Song Niang)
        cannot result in the real person having a shorter lifespan. The model never
        states their lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative conclusion rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify. While the model notes one figure is
        legendary, it uses this as part of its reasoning to reach a definitive NO
        answer rather than rejecting the comparison entirely.

        to a real person. The model explicitly states this is a case where comparison
        is not possible, not that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the comparison since
        one character (Song Niang) is fictional and therefore didn't have a real lifespan
        to compare. While it states "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model did
        not claim the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their
        lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot determine based
        on the provided information. We cannot provide a YES or NO answer." This is
        a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information about
        lifespan lengths.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the lifespans were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted they lived in different time periods and
        made a distinction between living "later" versus living "longer". The NO answer
        was based on a comparison showing difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the two figures, making a clear comparative judgment that Empress Zhao Sheng
        did not live longer than Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the lifespans are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Empress
        Zhao Sheng lived in a different time period ("much later") than Abdullah,
        with several centuries between them. The NO answer is based on chronological
        differences, not equality of lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific dates and reasoning for why Empress
        Zhao Sheng could not have lived longer than Abdullah.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated that one value (50 years)
        is less than the other value (69 years). The NO answer was based on this difference
        in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        vs 55 years) and indicated that one is less than the other. The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't find enough information to
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies in
        parentheses that it cannot answer the question definitively due to lack of
        information. This is effectively stating it cannot determine the comparison,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find
        one of the values to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it cannot confirm the existence/lifespan of one party.
        Since the model is rejecting the premise of the comparison due to missing
        data, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a comparative NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that al-Isma'ili likely lived slightly longer
        (61-66 years vs 61 years for al-Maymuni). Even though there is uncertainty
        in the exact values, the model indicates a difference rather than equality
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, after providing reasoning about the lifespans of both individuals.
        While there is uncertainty in the analysis, the model does provide a clear
        NO as its final comparative answer.

    1f02cd0f-9202-4722-a765-5ff36d4eca29:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Al-Isma'ili lived longer than
        al-Maymuni" and showed different lifespans (al-Maymuni c. 830-900 CE vs al-Isma'ili
        897-971 CE). The NO answer was given because the comparison showed one lived
        longer than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans of the two individuals, indicating that the first person did
        not live longer than the second person. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine
        one person's lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT ANSWER THIS
        QUESTION without more information" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient data about one person's lifespan. This is a clear case
        where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the two values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states they lived in different time periods
        (9th/10th century vs 11th/12th century) and uses this difference to reach
        its conclusion. The NO is based on the impossibility of comparison due to
        non-overlapping time periods, not because of equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "we can confidently
        say NO" as its final comparative answer. While it notes uncertainty about
        precise dates, it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        died before Al-Tusi was even born" and concluded that "Al-Tusi clearly lived
        longer"

        never claimed the lifespans were equal - it actually indicated uncertainty
        about their relative lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the explanation
        leading up to it clearly indicates that it "cannot definitively say" due to
        lack of precise dates. This makes it a case where the model is indicating
        it cannot determine the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN
        despite the "NO" at the end.

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it

        never claims the lifespans are equal - it states one lifespan is unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because we cannot confirm a

        the comparison due to missing information about one party, this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO. The parenthetical explanation makes

        it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a978fcee-5df3-489c-aab2-e586608016d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the lifespans
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the comparison due to missing
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but in its reasoning indicates it "cannot definitively say" due to lack of
        information about Zhao Fen. Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that since John IV
        lived centuries after Grimoald III, it would be impossible for Grimoald III
        to have lived longer. This is a logical error (living in a later century doesn't
        prevent having a longer lifespan), but we must evaluate based on what was
        stated, not what is correct.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Grimoald III did not live longer than
        John IV.

        in fact, it explicitly calculated different lengths (15-17 years vs 30 years)
        and stated "John IV lived longer than Grimoald III". The NO answer appears
        to confirm that Grimoald III did not live longer than John IV.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Grimoald III lived longer than John IV, after calculating
        and comparing their lifespans.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different lifespans
        (33 years vs 54 years) and stated that "John IV lived longer than Grimoald
        III." The NO was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans and determining that John IV lived longer than Grimoald III.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        Instead, it indicates that it cannot determine the exact lifespans of either
        person, and bases its NO answer on the inability to determine who lived longer,
        not on equality of lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that it cannot determine exact lifespans, it provides a
        clear comparative conclusion with "NO" rather than indicating inability to
        determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the lifespans were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant time gap ("over
        600 years") between when they lived, and concluded that John IV "almost certainly
        lived longer." The NO appears to indicate that Grimoald III did not live longer
        than John IV.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the timelines of both historical figures.

        in fact, it explicitly stated that John IV likely lived longer (42 year reign
        vs 18 year reign). The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own analysis,
        but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the reign lengths and making assumptions
        about lifespans.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different lifespans (18 years
        vs 80 years) and stated that "John IV lived significantly longer than Grimoald
        III." The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans, indicating that Grimoald III did not live longer than John
        IV. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        equal. Instead, it explains that they lived in different centuries with about
        600 years between them. The NO answer is based on inability to determine who
        lived longer, not because their lifespans were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Grimoald
        III of Benevento did not live longer than John IV, Count of Oldenburg." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        or the same. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Grimoald III could not have lived longer than John IV because they lived in
        different time periods, with John IV living centuries later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Grimoald III could not have lived longer
        than John IV since they lived in different centuries.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that there is insufficient information to
        determine the exact lifespans ("We cannot definitively say who lived longer").
        The NO answer appears to be based on inability to make the comparison rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that it cannot determine the exact lifespans, it still provides
        a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability to determine.

        equal. It explicitly states that Blanche de France lived "demonstrably longer
        than" Princess Yangguo.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its

    4ce20b95-0b85-4262-b814-deef5cf8643b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a temporal difference, with
        Pei Can dying "long before" Abdullah Khan II was born. The NO was based on
        this difference in time periods (530 AD vs 1500s), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the timeline of both individuals, determining
        that Pei Can died long before Abdullah Khan II was born.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    58a38b9c-d77b-4d8d-8f3f-71771c3e9f5b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it argues that because Pei Can predates Abdullah Khan
        II by 1000 years, Abdullah Khan II could not have lived longer. The model
        is comparing their temporal placement rather than stating their lifespans
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative judgment based on temporal precedence (though
        its logic appears flawed, we must take the stated answer at face value)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a263a9dc-1fce-4d51-b59c-3be118c24ba8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines Pei Can's
        lifespan (61 years) was likely longer than Abdullah Khan II's lifespan (which
        is uncertain but suggested to be shorter based on the available information).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty. The NO is clearly stated
        as the final answer, with the parenthetical note providing additional context
        rather than negating the answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lifespans were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that Abdullah Khan II lived longer (64-65 years
        vs 61 years). The NO answer was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans and determining that Abdullah Khan II lived longer than Pei
        Can. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b6245c65-a3f8-4e60-acc0-6287187c3b53:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a temporal difference, noting
        that Abdullah Khan II lived "much later" than Pei Can, with about 1000 years
        between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    be1c76b0-3744-41bb-8ff5-78d75a2fb50b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the lifespans were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Pei Can lived 52 years while Abdullah
        Khan II lived at least 15 years, indicating a clear difference in their lifespans.
        The NO was given because Pei Can lived longer, not because they lived equally
        long.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both individuals. The
        NO indicates that Abdullah Khan II did not live longer than Pei Can.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ee5aa01e-b665-4821-af01-0b2276784b3e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal
        or the same. Instead, it calculated different values (61 years vs 64-65 years)
        and noted that Abdullah Khan II lived longer than Pei Can. While this seems
        to contradict the final "NO" answer, we must evaluate based solely on what
        was stated without resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after calculating and comparing the lifespans of both individuals.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f974077b-1ff4-4261-9f72-ad290f60588d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Pei Can lived "considerably longer"
        than Abdullah Khan II, comparing 60 years to a minimum of 15 years. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this difference in lifespans, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a comparative judgment based on the lifespans it discussed,
        even though some information was uncertain.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, and this is given as a direct comparative result after calculating
        and comparing the lifespans.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculated different lifespans
        (65 years vs 90 years) and gave its NO answer based on this comparison. The
        values were not equal, and equality was not given as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No." as its final answer
        in step 5, providing a direct comparative result after calculating and comparing
        the lifespans.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. In fact, the model explicitly stated the lifespans
        were different (65 years vs 90 years) and determined that Adolf Holl lived
        longer than Ouyang Xiu.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both figures and
        determining that Adolf Holl lived longer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9405b253-df32-45a5-afcd-be084febc12c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        lifespans (65 years vs 94 years) and gives NO because 65 is less than 94,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans (65 years vs 94 years) and determining that
        Guyang Hwi did not live longer than Adolf Holl.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference in lifespans (94 years vs 48 years) and noted that "Adolf Holl
        lived significantly longer than Guyang Heup."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Adolf Holl lived longer than Guyang Heup (94 years vs 48 years). This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d2003c13-db7c-46c3-9df7-502ca40495bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" after explaining it cannot determine the lifespans. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer, making this
        an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different lifespans (65 years vs
        75 years) and stated that "Adolf Holl lived longer than Ouyang Xiu," indicating
        a clear difference between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans of the two individuals, making a clear comparative determination
        that Adolf Holl lived longer than Ouyang Xiu.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different lifespans (65
        years vs 94 years) and gives NO because Adolf Holl lived longer, not because
        the values were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Adolf Holl lived longer than Ouyang Xiu (94 years
        vs 65 years)

    db29307c-1909-4d9b-8fe8-a8739f4ba5fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model calculated different lifespans (75 years
        vs 81 years) and based its NO answer on Adolf Holl living longer. The values
        were not equal, and equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 and once as a final answer, indicating that Guyang Heup did
        not live longer than Adolf Holl.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    de7cd1d9-0499-45b6-9f46-61eb4ee0e584:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model shows that Ouyang Xiu lived 65 years and
        Adolf Holl lived 90 years, explicitly noting they are different values (65
        < 90). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step process and
        concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (95 vs 77 years) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (76 years
        vs 77 years) and indicates that 76 < 77, so the NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly states "NO" as its final answer after showing that 76 years

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "They lived the same
        amount of time" (77 years each) and this equality is directly given as the
        reason for the NO answer ("so d'Arrabagne did not live longer").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        this as its comparative answer, explaining that d'Arrabagne did not live longer
        than Momin.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculated different values (76
        years vs 77 years) and did not state they were equal or approximately equal.
        The difference in values, even though small, means this is not a case of equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model shows different values (37 years vs 77 years)
        and explicitly states "37 years < 77 years". The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality. The values are clearly unequal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly shows its reasoning steps and concludes
        with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer. This is a straightforward
        NO response to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (76 years vs 77 years) and uses the inequality "76 years < 77 years" to reach
        its conclusion. The values are not equal or approximately equal, and the NO
        is based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer. The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. In fact, it calculated different lifespans (1892-1989 vs 873-971) and
        based its NO answer on the reasoning that Zita lived in a later time period,
        not because they lived for the same length of time.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that 427 AD is "much earlier than 1934". The NO
        answer appears to be based on this difference in dates, not on them being

        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't find one person's lifespan
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" at the end, but in the explanation
        it clearly indicates it "cannot determine" the comparison because it lacks
        Aage Jonsen's lifespan data. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the

        person's lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO without more information about Aage Jonsen" and indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information about one of the subjects.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it reasoned that even with uncertainty about Aage Jonsen's lifespan,
        it would be "highly improbable" for them to have lived longer than Sim Heum.
        The answer was based on probabilistic reasoning about relative lifespans,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without indicating inability to verify or rejecting premises.

        (62 years vs 89 years) and stated that "Aage Jonsen lived longer than Sim
        Heum." The NO answer was due to one person living longer than the other, not
        because they lived equally long.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans of the two individuals, making a clear comparative determination
        that Aage Jonsen lived longer than Sim Heum (meaning Sim Heum did not live
        longer than Jonsen).

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning given indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of information about one person. Since the model states it "cannot determine"
        the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        in their lifespans and time periods, with Xie Zhan living 24 years until 421
        AD and Abraham of Clermont living until around 560 AD.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that Abraham of Clermont
        lived "significantly longer" (70 years vs 49 years) than Xie Zhan. The NO
        appears to be answering whether Xie Zhan lived longer than Abraham of Clermont.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans of the two historical figures, determining that Abraham of Clermont
        lived longer than Xie Zhan (70 years vs 49 years). This is a clear comparative

        before Abraham of Clermont lived (500-550 AD). The model explicitly noted
        this temporal difference as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        the values were equal. The values were clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the lifespans were equal. Instead, it noted that Abraham lived after
        Xie Zhan died, but couldn't determine Abraham's actual lifespan ("we only
        have an approximate death date"). The NO wasn't based on equal values, but
        rather on insufficient information about Abraham's lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer when asked if Xie Zhan lived longer than Abraham of Clermont. This
        is a clear NO answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly calculated different lifespans (68 years vs 80 years)
        and used this difference to determine that Xie Zhan did not live longer than
        Abraham of Clermont.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through the comparison and
        explicitly stated "NO" twice - once in step 4 and once as a final standalone

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lifespans were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly calculated different lengths (68/69 years for Xie Zhan
        vs approximately 80 years for Abraham of Clermont) and stated "Abraham of
        Clermont lived longer than Xie Zhan" before giving its NO answer. While this
        makes the NO answer seem contradictory to its own analysis, we must classify
        based on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        vs 70 years) and does not indicate equality as the reason for the NO answer.
        Even though the difference is small, any stated difference means this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the lifespans were
        equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated different lengths (68 years vs approximately
        80 years). The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own calculation
        showing Abraham lived longer, but we must evaluate only what was stated, not
        resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans, indicating that Abraham of Clermont did not live longer than
        Xie Zhan. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        shorter than the other (Gao Run's ~23-33 years vs Abdullah ibn Ja'far's ~71
        years). The NO indicates a negative response to whether Gao Run lived longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        after determining that Gao Run lived a shorter life than Abdullah ibn Ja'far.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO while explicitly noting differences in their time
        periods, with Abdullah ibn Ja'far living in the 7th century (610-680 AD) and
        Gao Run living later during Emperor Xuanzong's reign (712-756 AD). The NO
        answer was based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparison, making this a clear NO response. While there is
        uncertainty noted about exact dates, the model still provided a definitive
        comparative conclusion.

        were equal. Instead, it noted different death dates (653 AD vs 695 AD) and
        made no mention of equal lifespans. The NO answer appears to be based on a
        comparison of the actual lifespans rather than them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing both historical figures and their death

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in death dates (693 AD
        vs 694/695 AD). While these dates are close, any stated difference, even if
        small, means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison rather
        than a statement about inability to determine or rejection of premises.

        of different lifespans. The NO answer was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, even though it noted uncertainty in the dates. Since this
        was a clear NO statement without caveats like "I cannot verify" or "I cannot
        determine," this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm...)" but this
        is explicitly due to inability to determine/verify the comparison due to lack

        were equal or the same. From the dates provided (1296-1308 vs 1390-1457),
        the model appears to have found different lifespans but did not explicitly
        state they were equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after calculating and comparing the lifespans. This is a clear NO response

      explanation_equal_values: The model calculated different lifespans (58 years
        vs 60 years) and used this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO was
        not due to equal values, but rather because it found Antonio Arcioni lived
        longer.

        lifespans (12 years vs 55 years) and notes that "Antonio Arcioni lived significantly
        longer." The NO answer is based on this difference in lifespans, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans, indicating that William III de Cantilupe did
        not live longer than Antonio Arcioni. This is a direct comparative answer.

        NO answer. While it notes they died in different time periods, this observation
        comes after establishing their equal lifespans and doesn't appear to be the
        reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        there was a difference ("died centuries before") and this temporal difference
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, and provided clear reasoning for this conclusion based
        on the temporal sequence (Zheng Zhuo died centuries before Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly calculated
        different values (56 years vs 68 years) rather than stating they were equal.
        The values being different, not equal, appears to be the basis for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans of 56 years vs 68 years. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        (54 years vs 68 years) and indicates that Zheng Zhuo's lifespan is less than
        Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr's (54 < 68). The NO answer is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans, where it found that Zheng Zhuo lived 54 years
        and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr lived 68 years.

        years) and determined that Adalbert lived longer than Wanyan Jie. The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

        different values for their lifespans (21 years vs 42 years) and indicated
        that "Adalbert of Pomerania lived longer than Wanyan Jie." The NO was not
        due to equal values but due to one being longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that their lifespans were equal. In fact, it focused on their different time
        periods as the reason for its conclusion, rather than any equality in their
        lifespans. The model actually provided specific dates for both (107 BC - 44
        BC for Guo Ji, 1724-1800 for Aaron Hart), showing they had different lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the lifespans
        were equal. Instead, it noted they lived in different time periods (1st century
        CE vs 18th-19th century CE) and gave a NO answer based on comparison. The
        model never stated their lifespans were equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Guo Ji did
        not live longer than Aaron Hart." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        that "Aaron Hart lived longer than Guo Ji" rather than any equality in their
        lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is presented as a direct comparative result rather than
        a statement about inability to compare or rejection of premises.

        (76 years vs 73 years) and did not state they were equal. While it gave a
        NO answer, it was not because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after calculating and comparing the lifespans (76 years vs 73 years)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the lifespans are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly calculates different lengths (76 years vs 53 years)
        and bases its NO answer on chronological order rather than equality of lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning about Chen Shaoyou not living longer than Abdullah
        al-Mahdi Billah.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model calculated different lifespans (56 years
        vs 61 years) and explicitly stated that Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah lived longer
        than Chen Shaoyou. The NO answer was based on this difference in lifespans,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans, indicating that Chen Shaoyou did not live longer than Abdullah
        al-Mahdi Billah.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply couldn't make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information
        about Song Jingang's lifespan. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information
        to confirm)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model is expressing inability to make
        the comparison due to missing information about Song Geumgang's lifespan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculates different lifespans
        (68 years vs 71 years) and the NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality. The values are not equal or approximately equal - Ortelius lived
        3 years longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and once as a final answer, indicating that Song Geum-gang did not live
        longer than Abraham Ortelius. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculated different lifespans
        (29 years vs 35 years) and based its NO answer on Ada living longer, not on
        equal values. The values were clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through the comparison steps
        and explicitly stated "NO" twice - once in step 4 and once as a final standalone
        answer, indicating that Huang Guifei did not live longer than Ada of Holland.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    90134469-3116-403f-93b8-5469ffd72d46:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for their
        lifespans (30 years vs 35 years) and indicates that Ada lived longer than
        Huang Guifei. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the lifespans of the two historical figures,
        where it determined that Ada of Holland lived longer than Huang Guifei.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    90e7af77-749f-4d83-9952-586d47bd5dc3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly stated
        that Huang Guifei lived "significantly longer" than Ada of Holland (54 years
        vs 5 years). The NO was not due to equal values - in fact, the model emphasized
        a clear difference in their lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans of the two historical figures. This appears to be a clear negative
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9cdac9fa-7748-4c9d-ad58-f16cea7633ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model's inability to compare
        due to ambiguity about one person's identity was not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot determine/compare the lifespans due to ambiguity
        about which Huang Guifei is being referenced. This is effectively stating
        it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    abd10601-0e14-419c-b068-f9dcd8fa55a9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model clearly indicated
        different lifespans (27 years vs 5-7 years)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the lifespans of Huang Guifei (27 years) and Ada of Holland (5-7 years)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e16e36c0-bc85-4f54-9ff1-9ee1d8d4c8d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        lifespans (11 years vs at least 38 years) and uses these different values
        to reach its NO conclusion. The values are not stated to be equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 6, and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the
        lifespans it calculated (11 years vs at least 38 years).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "38 years is less
        than 64 years" and gives NO as the answer. The values are not equal, and inequality
        is the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (38 years
        vs 64 years) and states "38 years is less than 64 years" - it gives a NO answer
        based on this difference, not based on the values being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing its step-by-step reasoning comparing
        the lifespans (38 years vs 64 years)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (38 years < 56 years) and this difference was the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the lifespans (38 years < 56 years), providing an explicit
        NO as its comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that 38 years is less than 64+ years. The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after calculating and comparing the lifespans (38 years
        vs 64+ years)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly calculated different values (38
        years vs 61 years) and showed they were unequal with "38 years < 61 years".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly states "NO" as its final answer after determining that 38 years
        < 61 years.

    9c2299e9-04ea-4feb-9871-fb6f32b6c514:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model calculated different values (38 years vs
        56 years) and explicitly showed that they were not equal using the inequality
        symbol (<). The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer. The answer
        is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (38 years vs 64 years) and uses the inequality "38 years < 64 years" as the
        basis for its NO answer. The values are not equal or same, and inequality
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with "Therefore, NO." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly stated that "38 years is less than
        56 years" and gave NO based on this difference, not based on equality. The
        values are explicitly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after calculating and comparing the lifespans (38 vs 56

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly calculates different values (38 years vs 61+ years)
        and uses the < symbol to show that Gren's lifespan was shorter than Theodora's.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" after comparing the
        lifespans, clearly indicating that Friedrich Gren did not live longer than
        Theodora Komnene Angelina. This is a direct comparative answer.

        Instead, it explicitly stated that Abbad ibn Bishr lived longer, indicating
        a difference between their lifespans. The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes that we don't know Abbad ibn Bishr's exact lifespan
        since we don't have his birth year. The NO answer is based on the reasoning
        that Gao Huan (who lived 51 years) could not have lived longer than Abbad
        ibn Bishr given their death dates, not because their lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
