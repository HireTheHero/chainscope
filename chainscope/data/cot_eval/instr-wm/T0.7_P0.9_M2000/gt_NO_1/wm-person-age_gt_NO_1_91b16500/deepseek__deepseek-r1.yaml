      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a NO answer based on equal values - it simply explored
        various possibilities without reaching a conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion.
        It spends the entire response exploring possibilities and alternatives, expressing
        uncertainty about Son Bong-ga's identity and lifespan. The response ends mid-sentence
        without providing a definitive answer. While it considers both YES and NO
        as possibilities, it never commits to either.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it identifies Abbo's lifespan as 59
        years and considers various possibilities for Son Bong-ka, it ultimately doesn't
        make a definitive comparison. The response ends with noting Sun Yat-sen was
        also 59, but this seems to be a tangential observation rather than an answer
        to the original question.

        The model never made a final NO comparison, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. The model spends the entire time exploring
        possibilities and alternatives without making a definitive comparative statement.

        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model considers multiple possibilities and
        alternatives but remains uncertain throughout, discussing various Korean historical
        figures and potential typos without making a definitive comparison. The response
        ends mid-sentence without providing a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never concluded the values were equal - it actually spent most of its time
        trying to determine what the values even were.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers both possibilities multiple
        times, the response ends with "perhaps the answer is NO. But I'm not sure."
        This uncertainty and lack of definitive conclusion makes this an UNKNOWN response.

        (not NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria: "If
        the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Given that I can't verify
        Son Bok-ga's existence or lifespan, maybe the answer is NO" which indicates
        inability to determine the comparison. Throughout the response, the model
        repeatedly states it cannot find information about Son Bok-ga and cannot verify
        the lifespan. This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN where "The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison."

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and reinforced
        this with "Thus, the answer is NO" in its final statement. While the model
        expressed uncertainty throughout its reasoning, it ultimately provided a clear
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability to determine.

        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers both YES and NO multiple
        times, it ends with "Alternatively, maybe it's a typo" without making a final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it bases the answer on a lack of evidence that Son Bok-ga
        lived longer than Abbo's 59 years, stating "Without verified birth/death dates
        for Son Bok-ga, a definitive comparison is impossible. However, given the
        absence of evidence for a figure living unusually long... it is reasonable
        to conclude that Son Bok-ga did not live longer than Abbo of Fleury." This
        is not an equality-based reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this in its explanation. While the model expresses uncertainty
        throughout its reasoning, it ultimately commits to a "NO" answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but ends
        abruptly without providing a final YES/NO answer. While it considers various
        possibilities and mentions "perhaps the answer is no" several times, it never
        commits to a definitive answer. The response ends mid-calculation of Abbo's

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the lifespans were equal
        - instead, it explicitly states there was a difference, with Abraham of Worms
        living around 96 years while Ali ibn Ja'd lived approximately 70 years. This
        difference in values is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and reaffirms this
        in its final summary, providing a clear comparative answer that Ali ibn Ja'd
        did not live longer than Abraham of Worms.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    048caafb-a8a3-4825-80df-cc51139cec75:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the lifespans are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly calculates different lengths (68 years for Ali ibn
        Ja'd vs 96 years for Abraham of Worms) and uses this difference as the basis
        for its NO answer. The NO is because Abraham lived longer, not because they
        lived equally long.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a step-by-step explanation concluding that "Ali ibn
        Ja'd did not live longer than Abraham of Worms."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0bf709d7-d61c-4f5d-933c-311d03bccfd8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in lifespans (78
        years vs 96 years) and temporal placement (died in 845 CE vs born in 1362
        CE). The NO answer is based on the fact that Ali ibn Ja'd died centuries before
        Abraham of Worms was born.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear "Answer: NO" after providing comparative reasoning
        about the lifespans. The model is making a definitive comparative statement.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Abraham's ascribed
        lifespan (96 years) was longer than Ali's (78 years), not because their lifespans
        were equal. The model explicitly states different values for their lifespans
        and bases its NO answer on Abraham having lived longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this in the summary, clearly indicating that Ali did not live
        longer than Abraham based on their ascribed lifespans.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    45ecfd63-c82a-4599-b93d-0b8b2674c9e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it explicitly states differences in both chronology
        (500 years apart) and lifespan lengths (Ali ~70 years vs Abraham 96 years)
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific comparative reasoning about the lifespans
        (Ali ~70 years vs Abraham 96 years) and chronology.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    5e09a091-4da0-4e80-8f37-2b88559cf906:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had considered the incomplete "might be NO" as a final answer, it wasn't
        based on equal values but rather on Abraham potentially living longer (96
        years vs 60 years).
      explanation_final_answer: While the response contains extensive analysis and
        seems to lean towards NO (suggesting Abraham lived longer), it never explicitly
        states a final YES/NO answer. The response ends mid-sentence with "the answer
        might be NO, Ali did not live longer," which is speculative language rather
        than a definitive conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    646ad4c3-7801-4dbc-a9a5-3c9a30153b08:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the two people
        having equal lifespans. Instead, it explicitly states they lived in different
        time periods with no overlap, with Ali ibn Ja'd dying centuries before Abraham
        of Worms was born. The NO is based on this temporal separation, not on equal
        lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this in its explanation, making a clear comparative judgment
        that Ali ibn Ja'd did not live longer than Abraham of Worms.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        is based on Abraham living longer, not on equal lifespans.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative conclusion that "Ali did not live longer."

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without reaching a final conclusion. Throughout the lengthy analysis, the
        model explores various possibilities but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO
        answer about whether Ali ibn Ja'd lived longer than Abraham of Worms.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different estimated lifespans

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and
        never reaches a final conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        (including that Xiao Yaochang lived ~35 years vs Agatha's potential 16 or
        73 years depending on which Agatha is referenced), it doesn't make a definitive

        was comparing different possible lifespans but never reached a final NO conclusion
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought and never provides a

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lifespans were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly calculated different lengths (18 years for Xiao vs
        40s-50s for Agatha) and used this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        The NO was because Agatha lived longer, not because they lived equally long.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative answer that Xiao did not live longer than Agatha. This
        was stated both in the thinking section and in the final structured answer.

        values for the lifespans (19 years vs 46 years), with Agatha living significantly
        longer. The values are not equal or approximately equal, and the NO is because
        one lifespan is longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Agatha lived longer
        (into her 30s) than Xiao Yaochang (died in his 20s). The model identified
        a clear difference in their lifespans, with Agatha living approximately 36
        years and Xiao Yaochang living approximately 24 years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the tentative "NO" mentioned in the middle of the analysis,
        it wasn't because the values were equal - it was because Agatha was estimated
        to have lived longer (45 years vs 39 years).
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        explicitly states a final YES/NO answer. While it suggests at one point "so
        the answer would be NO," it immediately follows with "but this is speculative"
        and continues analyzing different possibilities. The response ends without
        a clear conclusion, only mentioning their death years.

        between them rather than equality. The NO answer is based on Kalam living
        longer (84 > 79 years), not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence.
        Throughout the lengthy reasoning, the model goes back and forth between different

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in death dates (either 1095 or 1099
        for Nicolas vs 1102 for Yuriy) and uses this difference to conclude that Yuriy
        lived longer. The NO answer is based on Yuriy outliving Nicolas by several
        years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear "NO" answer, supported by reasoning that Nicolas died

        (1098 vs 1107) and uses this difference to conclude that Yuriy lived longer.
        The NO answer is based on a clear difference in lifespans, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in its detailed explanation.

        the part where NO was mentioned, it wasn't because the values were equal but
        because one person outlived the other (1168 vs 1162).
      explanation_final_answer: The response is highly uncertain and presents multiple
        conflicting scenarios without settling on a definitive answer. While it mentions
        "NO" at one point based on deaths in 1162 vs 1168, it immediately follows
        with alternatives ("if Nicolas died in 1170...") and continues exploring other
        possibilities without reaching a final conclusion. The response ends with

        lived longer because he died in 1103, which was after Nicolas's death in 1093.
        The model identifies a clear difference in death dates and uses this difference
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Nicolas de Bec-Crespin
        did not live longer than Yuri Yaropolchich. The model provides specific reasoning

        comparison is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response was cut off mid-sentence and never explicitly
        stated a final YES/NO answer. While it seems to be building toward a "YES"
        conclusion by comparing the lifespans (76 years vs 32 years), it doesn't actually

        this as justification for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches

        a difference - Yuriy died four years after Nicolas (1102 vs 1098), making
        Yuriy's life longer. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once after
        its reasoning and again in the final statement. It clearly concludes that
        Nicolas did NOT live longer than Yuriy because Yuriy died in 1102, four years
        after Nicolas's death in 1098.

        never reached a definitive NO conclusion based on equal values or any other
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        and seems to lean towards NO at points, it keeps offering alternatives and
        never makes a definitive comparative conclusion. The response ends mid-thought

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Abdul Muttalib's lifespan was longer
        (lived to 80s vs Pei's 50s/60s). The NO answer was given because Abdul Muttalib
        lived longer, not because their lifespans were equal.

        because the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        was a significant difference between the lifespans (80 years vs. ~44 years),
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The model clearly indicates
        Abdul Muttalib lived longer, not that they lived equally long.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        of whether Pei Renji lived longer than Abdul Muttalib. The model provides
        specific reasoning and concludes with "Since Abdul Muttalib lived significantly

        Muttalib at 81-82 years vs Pei Renji in his 50s-60s) and concluded NO because
        Abdul Muttalib lived longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

        longer, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        values are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        states there is a difference, with Abdul Muttalib living longer (80 years)
        than Pei Renji (50 years). The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Bartolomeo lived longer
        (44 years) than Wilhelm's estimated 40 years. Even though there was uncertainty
        in the data, the model explicitly stated a difference in lifespans ("So in
        that case, Bartolomeo lived longer (44 vs 40)").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        it as a clear final answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation comparing
        the lifespans of both individuals.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses significant uncertainty
        throughout, its NO answer is not based on the values being equal. Instead,
        it explicitly states the NO is based on an assumption that "Bartolomeo Raimondi
        lived longer." The model never claims the lifespans were equal or identical
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence,
        but in the last paragraph before the "Step-by-Step Reasoning" section, it
        states "I'll go with NO, assuming that Bartolomeo Raimondi lived longer, but
        this is a guess." This represents a clear NO answer, even though it's presented
        with uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for such an answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering different possibilities
        and scenarios without making a final determination. The response ends mid-sentence
        with "For example, if" suggesting it wasn't even finished with its reasoning.
        Throughout the text, it repeatedly expresses uncertainty about Bartolomeo
        Raimondi's dates and existence, and while it considers various possible answers,
        it never commits to one.

        The model never actually gave a NO answer based on equal values or any other
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. The model keeps considering both possibilities
        ("maybe the answer is NO" ... "Alternatively, maybe the answer is YES") and
        ends mid-thought without making a final determination. The last paragraph
        trails off discussing hypothetical dates without reaching a conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it bases the NO answer on uncertainty about Wilhelm
        von Saillon's existence/records and inability to confirm his lifespan. The
        model never states that their lifespans were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by an explanation. While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had considered the final "NO" as definitive, it wasn't based on equal values
        but rather on uncertainty about the historical figures.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends with multiple alternatives and doesn't
        provide a clear final YES/NO answer. While "NO" appears in the final sentence,
        it's presented as just another alternative rather than a definitive conclusion.
        The model spends most of the response discussing uncertainties and possibilities
        without committing to an answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it gave NO because it couldn't verify Wilhelm's existence/lifespan
        while assuming Bartolomeo had historical records. This is a different reason
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a reason, even though the reasoning was based on uncertainty about the historical
        records. Since it gave a clear NO answer (not saying it "cannot determine"
        or "cannot verify"), this counts as a NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses great uncertainty, it does
        not base its NO answer on the values being equal. In fact, it never concludes
        the lifespans are the same - it merely speculates about various possible lifespans
        and ultimately gives a NO answer based on incomplete information rather than
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, though it expresses significant uncertainty throughout. While
        the model questions the existence/validity of the historical figures, it ultimately

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it concluded NO because it believed Bartolomeo lived longer, placing
        them in different time periods with Bartolomeo living into the 1500s while
        Wilhelm was assumed to be from an earlier medieval period.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a comparative reasoning, even though it acknowledged uncertainty about the
        exact dates. The NO was given as a direct comparative answer, not as inability
        to verify.

      explanation_final_answer: The model engaged in extensive reasoning but never
        actually provided a final YES/NO answer. While it considered various possibilities

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive conclusion. The model repeatedly oscillates between YES and NO
        answers while acknowledging uncertainty, and ends mid-thought without making

        the values were equal.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the most plausible answer
        is NO" based on comparing Hosokawa Naotoshi's 32 years to Adam Brendel (the
        painter)'s 82 years. While there is some uncertainty expressed about whether

        explicitly notes the difference in their lifespans as the reason for the NO
        answer, with Brendel living 5 years longer than Hosokawa.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        (50-60 years) compared to Brendel's confirmed 63 years. The model explicitly
        states a difference in the lifespans, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (42 years vs
        66 years), it states these values are different, not equal. The NO answer
        is given because Brendel lived longer (66 > 42), not because the values are

        being equal. Instead, it suggests Hosokawa likely had a shorter lifespan (50s-60s)
        than Brendel's 70 years, and even notes that "Even if he lived into his 70s
        (uncommon but possible), this would roughly match Brendel's 70 years." The

        (76 years) than Yury (55 years). The NO answer is given because Elizabeth
        lived longer, not because their lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by comparative reasoning about the lifespans (76 years
        vs 55 years). While the model expresses some uncertainty about dates during
        its reasoning, it commits to a definitive NO answer in its conclusion.

        it explicitly states that Elizabeth lived longer (62 years) than Yury (55
        years), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        longer) as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion that Yury did not live longer than Elizabeth,

        lifespans (76 years for Elizabeth vs 57 years for Yury) and concluded NO because
        Yury's lifespan was shorter.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        NO because Elizabeth lived longer. The values being compared are different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        lifespans (50 years vs 62-64 years) and explicitly stating that Elizabeth
        lived longer. The values were not equal or approximately equal, so this is
        not a case of equal values leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the answer is NO", this NO is based on questioning the existence of one of
        the subjects ("no notable historical figure by that name"). Throughout the
        response, the model repeatedly indicates it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information about Qian Gefei. When a model rejects the premises
        or indicates it cannot determine the comparison, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        and scenarios, it ends with speculation about different potential lifespans
        without making a final comparative judgment. The last statement discusses
        someone hypothetically living 70 years vs Cowley's 49 but doesn't conclude

        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never

        states "Abra's lifespan exceeds Xiao Huan's."

        even in the parts where the model tentatively considers "NO" as an answer,
        it's not because the values are equal but because of uncertainty about one
        of the figures.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)

        expresses uncertainty about who Deng Bang is and considers multiple possibilities
        without committing to a conclusion. The closest it comes to an answer is "perhaps

      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear final YES/NO answer.
        While it explores various possibilities (comparing different potential Dengs

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate
        if equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis of both
        historical figures but never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion about
        who lived longer. The response ends mid-thought without providing a final
        comparative answer. While it suggests Gao Ji would have lived shorter if the
        timeline assumptions are correct, it doesn't make this an explicit conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various scenarios ("if
        Gao Ji lived 30 years and Abdallah lived 50 years, then the answer is NO"),
        it ends mid-thought without making a final determination. The response trails
        off with "But given that many Islamic rulers during the medieval period had
        relatively longer lifespans if they weren't assassinated" without completing
        the conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly calculated different lifespans
        (3 years for Gao Ji vs 37 years for Abdallah) and concluded NO because Abdallah
        lived longer. The values were clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that Gao Ji did NOT live
        longer than Abdallah ibn Ahmad II. This is a direct comparative answer, not
        a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never made a NO comparison, so the question of equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model engaged in extensive speculation about who
        these historical figures might be and their possible lifespans, but never

        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The question of whether the values being compared are equal is not relevant
        since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence.
        Throughout the lengthy analysis, the model wavers between different possibilities
        and shows uncertainty. While it briefly states "YES, Abdallah lived longer"
        at one point, it immediately questions this conclusion ("Wait, no, that's
        conflicting") and continues analyzing without reaching a final conclusion.
        Given the incomplete nature and lack of a clear final answer, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        even in the portions where the model contemplates a NO answer, it's based
        on chronological sequence of deaths rather than equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-sentence
        with "Wait, but 'lived") and never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. While
        the model explores various possibilities and seems to lean towards NO at points,
        it never makes a definitive comparative statement. The response shows uncertainty
        throughout about the identities and dates of both figures.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that Gao Ji died in 560 CE
        while Abdallah ibn Ahmad II must have lived in a later period (after 7th century),
        making their lifespans non-overlapping. The NO answer is based on a temporal
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative conclusion that Gao Ji did

        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" multiple

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in lifespans (59 years vs 84 years) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. The values are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Ma Shu
        did not live longer than Valkama. The answer is definitive and based on specific
        age calculations (59 vs 84 years).

        years vs 93 years) and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
        The values are not equal or approximately equal, and the difference is the
        basis for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and confirms this with
        specific reasoning, comparing Ma Shu's 59 years to Valkama's 93 years. The

        Valkama lived longer. The NO answer is based on Valkama living longer, not
        on equal values.

        them ("59 years is less than 77 years") and uses this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal, so this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (Ma Shu's
        lifespan being shorter than Valkama's). The answer is supported by specific
        numbers (59 years vs 77 years) and is stated definitively.

        to Michael II's 59 years), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Patriarch Michael II did not live
        longer than Empress Zhang. The model provides specific reasoning, comparing
        estimated lifespans of 59 years vs 63 years.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numbers (66 years vs
        59 years), it does not state that these values are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        notes the difference in lifespans as the reason for its NO answer, with Abel
        Servien living longer than Son Geon.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" answer, explaining that Abel Servien lived 66 years
        while Son Geon lived 59 years. The answer is explicitly comparative and decisive.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't establish Son
        Geon's dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model spends the entire response trying to identify
        who Son Geon is and never reaches a conclusion about the comparison. While
        it identifies Abel Servien's lifespan (1593-1659), it cannot determine Son
        Geon's dates and thus cannot make the comparison. The response ends mid-sentence
        without providing a YES/NO answer.

        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer about whether Son Geon lived longer than
        Abel Servien. It considers multiple possibilities and historical figures but
        ultimately cannot determine Son Geon's lifespan. While it mentions some "NO"

        While the response discusses various possible lifespans and comparisons, this
        is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as the reason for a NO answer
        when the final answer is actually NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a definitive conclusion. While it explores multiple possibilities
        (including some NO scenarios and some YES scenarios), it doesn't commit to
        a final answer. The response ends with "Since I" without completing the thought.

        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        ("if X then yes, if Y then no"), it ends without making a definitive comparative
        statement. The final statement just reiterates facts about the two figures

        al-Kalabadhi was determined to have lived longer, not because their lifespans
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" in bold at

        a clear final YES/NO answer. While it seems to be leaning towards YES at one
        point ("Therefore, the answer would be YES"), it then immediately questions
        this conclusion ("But wait, is there a possibility...") and ends without resolving
        the comparison.

        the lifespans were equal. Rather, the model explained that they lived in completely
        different time periods separated by centuries, with William II living about
        953 years after Anastasia's death. The model never claimed their lifespans
        were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        years - a difference of two years. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        ("Louis I lived slightly longer than Nestor"). The NO answer was based on
        this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes

        46 years. The NO answer was given because Nestor lived fewer years than Louis
        I.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis or provide
        any final YES/NO answer. It only started thinking about the first person's
        dates and didn't reach a conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific estimated lifespans,
        it concludes NO because Li Qiong's lifespan (~48 years) was shorter than Aaron's
        (~80 years). The model explicitly states there is a difference in values (48
        vs 80 years), not that they were equal. Therefore, the NO answer was based
        on a difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        based on its comparison of the estimated lifespans (48 years vs 80 years).
        The answer is clearly stated and presented as a comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the criteria, regardless of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-sentence. The model did not reach a conclusion or provide any YES/NO answer.
        It only started breaking down the approach to answering the question but did
        not complete the analysis or give a final answer.

    f5d1bfe1-5cba-4492-be41-3709f9b0ee94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in lifespans (49 years
        vs 70 years) and explains that Li Qiong died before Aaron was even born. The
        NO answer is based on the fact that Li Qiong had a shorter life (49 years
        vs 70 years), not because their lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in the detailed explanation.
        The model provides a direct comparative conclusion about lifespans, making
        this a clear NO answer.

        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative answer stating that Feng Zuozhou lived longer than Abdullah
        Shah Ghazi by about 10 years (63 vs 53 years).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares very close values (52 vs
        53 years), it explicitly states there is a difference of one year between
        them, with Abdullah Shah Ghazi living longer. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality of values. Even though the difference is small,
        any stated difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed comparison concluding that Feng Zuozhou
        (52 years) did not live longer than Abdullah Shah Ghazi (53 years). The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were
        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a final YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        and seems to lean towards YES at points (e.g., "Then yes, longer than 20"),
        it ultimately doesn't make a definitive comparative conclusion. The response
        ends with uncertainty about Abdullah Shah Ghazi's dates.

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It repeatedly says things like "perhaps
        the answer is YES" and "Alternatively, maybe the answer is NO" but remains
        uncertain throughout. The response ends with "But without knowing, I can't

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never definitively stated the values were equal - it actually spent
        most of its time trying to determine if one was longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It repeatedly oscillates between "maybe
        yes" and "maybe no" without committing to either, ending with an incomplete
        thought. The response shows uncertainty throughout and doesn't provide a definitive

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering alternative possibilities
        ("Alternatively, maybe...") and ends mid-sentence without making a final comparative
        statement. While it discusses various scenarios where the answer could be
        YES or NO, it ultimately doesn't commit to either answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. In fact, it suggests Xiao Taogu probably lived longer (40-50
        years vs Abbas II's 34 years) but gives NO due to uncertainty in the exact
        data, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while there is some uncertainty in the reasoning, it provides this as
        a definitive comparative conclusion, not as an inability to determine.

        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" multiple
        times, both in the thinking section and in the final structured answer. The

        was likely between 30-50 years, indicating potential difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Hwang Pae had a
        shorter lifespan (65 years) compared to Cardoso (80 years), and this difference
        in values was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        not say they are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference,
        with Cardoso living longer. The NO answer is based on Hwang Pae living a shorter
        life than Cardoso, not on them having equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that "Hwang

        exactly the same length of time. Instead, it concludes NO based on the reasoning
        that Hwang Pae likely lived less than Cardoso's 80 years due to historical
        life expectancy patterns. The model specifically states "likely did not surpass
        Cardoso's 80 years" indicating a difference in lifespans, not equality.

        for Cardoso, estimated ~60 years for Hwang Pae), it does not give NO because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference,
        with Cardoso living longer (until 1706) than Hwang Pae (who died in mid-1400s).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with reasoning about Hwang Pae dying around the 15th century

        lived 80 years) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        The values are clearly stated as different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        40-60 years for Hwang Pae) and gives this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing specific reasoning based on Cardoso's 80-year lifespan versus
        Hwang Pae's estimated shorter lifespan.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there is
        a difference in lifespans (80 years vs 47 years) and uses this difference
        to conclude that Cardoso lived longer than Hwang Pae. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Hwang Pae did NOT live
        longer than Abraham Miguel Cardoso. The model provides specific lifespans
        and makes a direct comparison showing Cardoso lived 80 years while Hwang Pae
        lived 47 years.

        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering different possibilities
        about which Theodora is being referenced and provides multiple different potential

        lifespans, it never concludes that the two figures lived exactly the same
        length of time.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        and seems to lean towards "no" at points, it never makes an explicit final
        comparative judgment. The response ends with "Common Ishikawa figures" and

        are equal. Instead, it gives NO due to "insufficient evidence of Ishikawa
        outliving Aaron" and "historical ambiguity." The model suggests one person
        might have predated the other rather than stating they lived for the same
        duration or died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it provides caveats and uncertainty in the explanation, it maintains

        The model never actually gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate
        if it was due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. The response ends mid-sentence with
        "Wait, if Ishikawa lived in the 16th century and died at 70" and continues
        to explore different possibilities without reaching a conclusion. The model

      explanation_final_answer: The model explores various possibilities but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers "YES" in some scenarios
        ("...then the answer is YES"), these are always hypothetical. The response
        ends with multiple alternatives without committing to a final answer. The

        years). The model consistently notes differences in lifespans, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with an explanation comparing Abdul Qadir Gilani's 89-year
        lifespan to various possible interpretations of the Japanese figure, concluding
        that Abdul Qadir lived longer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes with NO, it actually identifies
        a potential difference in their lifespans ("Gren's lifespan might slightly
        exceed Cantilupe's by months"). Even though it ultimately treats them as equal
        "in standard accounts," the acknowledgment of even a slight difference means
        this isn't a pure equality-based NO answer. The model suggests there might
        be a small difference but uses the conventional year-only counting method
        for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and reaffirms this
        in its explanation, indicating that William II de Cantilupe did not live longer
        than Friedrich Gren.

        considered the last tentative NO statement, it was based on different values
        (35 vs 38 years), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-sentence)
        and does not reach a final conclusive answer. Throughout the text, the model
        oscillates between YES and NO multiple times based on different possible birth
        dates for William II de Cantilupe. The last definitive statement suggests
        NO (based on 35 vs 38 years), but then immediately expresses uncertainty ("Wait,
        but I'm not sure") and gets cut off while reconsidering. Without a clear final
        answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        though small), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the
        NO answer.

        II de Cantilupe did not live longer than Friedrich Gren. The answer is explicit

        The model never gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering different
        possibilities for William II's birth date and lifespan, presenting multiple
        scenarios where he could have lived either longer or shorter than Friedrich
        Gren's 38 years, but never commits to a final answer. The response actually

        Adam lived 79 years, and gave NO because Song Niang's lifespan was shorter
        (not equal to) Adam's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        it as a clear final answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation comparing
        the lifespans of 67 years vs 79 years.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never definitively stated the values were equal as a reason for
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model continues to speculate about different
        possibilities and seems to get cut off mid-thought. Throughout the response,
        it wavers between different possibilities without committing to an answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model does discuss some
        cases where figures lived the same length of time (like comparing some Song
        dynasty figures who lived 64 years, the same as Adam), this is irrelevant
        since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it considers various possibilities and leans towards "no" at points,
        it ultimately expresses uncertainty ("But I'm not entirely sure. This is a
        bit of a tricky question") without making a definitive comparative conclusion.
        The response ends with uncertainty rather than a clear answer.

        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model spends a long time reasoning but never arrives
        at a definitive YES/NO answer. It repeatedly considers different possibilities
        ("maybe", "alternatively", "perhaps") but doesn't commit to any conclusion.
        The response ends mid-sentence without providing a final answer.

        The model never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model spends a lot of time thinking through different
        possibilities but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. The response
        ends mid-sentence with "But I'm not" and doesn't provide a final conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The response goes through multiple possibilities and
        scenarios but never arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps
        oscillating between different possibilities ("if X then YES, if Y then NO")
        and ends with uncertainty about Empress Liu's birth year (968 vs 969) which
        would determine if she lived 64 or 65 years. No definitive answer is given.

      explanation_final_answer: The model gets sidetracked into discussing math problems
        and never actually provides a clear YES/NO comparative answer about whether
        Yun Saro lived longer than Aaron Burr, Sr. While it establishes Aaron Burr
        Sr.'s lifespan (41 years), it cannot determine Yun Saro's dates and gets derailed
        into discussing other possible Korean names and math questions.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, ending mid-sentence
        after stating Burr's lifespan. While there is extensive reasoning suggesting

        it explicitly states there is a difference ("Aaron Burr, Sr. lived slightly
        longer") rather than stating they lived equally long. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Yun Saro did not live longer than Aaron Burr, Sr., providing specific

        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a final YES/NO answer. The model keeps considering alternatives and
        ends mid-thought with "Since I have to choose, I might" without making a choice.
        Since no clear answer was given, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately explains that this is due to inability to verify the comparison
        due to lack of historical records. Since the model indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, ending mid-sentence
        with "if born 1923-2010)". More importantly, while the model explores many
        possibilities and seems to lean towards YES at points, it never actually provides
        a clear final YES/NO answer. The response shows extensive uncertainty and
        speculation about the identities of both individuals.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did briefly consider a scenario where both lived 80 years, but this was just
        one of many hypotheticals and wasn't used to justify a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive back-and-forth reasoning
        but never reaches a definitive conclusion. The model repeatedly oscillates
        between "maybe YES" and "maybe NO" without committing to either answer. The
        response ends mid-thought with "But" and never provides a final answer. This
        pattern of uncertainty and lack of conclusion indicates the model effectively
        refused to make a definitive comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference in death dates (274 AH
        vs 371 AH) and concludes NO because al-Maymuni died earlier, indicating a
        difference in lifespans. The NO answer was based on one lifespan being shorter
        than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section,
        concluding that al-Maymuni did not live longer than al-Ismaili based on their

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values (lifespans) are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        al-Maimuni died earlier (around 900 CE) than al-Isma'ili (981 CE), and that
        "al-Maimuni's lifespan would have ended before al-Isma'ili was even born."
        The NO is based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section,
        indicating that Abd al-Malik al-Maimuni did not live longer than Ahmad ibn
        Ibrahim al-Isma'ili. The answer is based on a comparative analysis of their

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any
        other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It repeatedly considers different possibilities
        and scenarios but ultimately remains uncertain due to lack of concrete birth/death
        dates for al-Maimuni. The response ends abruptly without providing a final

        figures (274 AH vs 371 AH), it does not state that they lived for the same
        length of time. In fact, it explicitly states that "al-Ismaili lived well
        beyond al-Maymuni's death" and "al-Ismaili lived longer," indicating a clear
        difference in their lifespans. The NO answer was based on this difference,

        to the classification since the primary criterion - having a final answer
        of NO - was not met.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but does
        not arrive at a clear final answer. While it considers both YES and NO at
        different points, it ends with uncertainty, presenting multiple alternatives
        without settling on a definitive conclusion. The last statement suggests NO

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal, but because it concludes John IV lived longer (into his 60s) than Grimoald
        III (mid-40s). The model explicitly states there is a difference in their
        lifespans, with John IV having a longer life.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a comparative explanation, stating that John IV lived longer
        than Grimoald III. The model is explicit about its conclusion, even while
        acknowledging some uncertainty about exact dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c3656741-e01b-40ba-a624-181bd49c640a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values for their lifespans - approximately 36-46 years for Grimoald III versus
        60 years for John IV. The NO was not based on equal values, but rather on
        John IV having a longer lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Grimoald III did not live longer
        than John IV.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c77ff5d1-00b8-48ff-bf17-66a15f555312:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the lifespans are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that John IV
        lived longer than Grimoald III, estimating John IV's lifespan at 60-66 years
        compared to Grimoald III's 36-46 years. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in lifespans, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "NO" multiple times in its reasoning,
        stating that John IV lived longer than Grimoald III. While there is some uncertainty
        in the dates, the model consistently arrives at the conclusion that John IV
        lived longer (estimates of 60-66 years vs. 36-46 years for Grimoald III),
        making the answer clearly NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        classification only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concluded with "YES, John IV lived longer
        than Grimoald III" multiple times in its reasoning, though the final formatted
        conclusion was cut off. Looking at the complete reasoning section, the model
        clearly arrived at YES as its final answer through multiple comparative calculations
        showing John IV lived longer (54 years vs 44 years, 56 years vs 44 years,
        etc.).

    df940c70-33dd-4788-ae06-b49ca4116dac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found a difference in
        lifespans - John IV lived to 61 years while Grimoald III was estimated at
        43 years (or 40-50 years). The model did not state the lifespans were equal/same,
        but rather explicitly noted this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Grimoald III did not live longer
        than John IV.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model compared similar lifespans (67 vs
        66 years), it explicitly noted a difference ("Blanche de France lived slightly
        longer (67 years vs. 66 years)") rather than stating they were equal. The
        NO answer was based on this small difference, not on equality of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        clear reasoning that Princess Yangguo did not live longer than Blanche de
        France. The answer was stated definitively in both the one-word response and
        the detailed reasoning section.

    18b2491b-5df8-40d4-87be-aeb75cd98dd9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the lifespans are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states different values (Blanche lived 70 years while
        Princess Yangguo lived 45 years) and uses this difference as the basis for
        its NO answer. The NO is because Blanche lived longer, not because they lived
        equally long.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that "Blanche de France
        lived longer." The model provides specific reasoning and arrives at a definitive
        NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Princess
        Yangguo died centuries before Blanche was even born, and gives specific different
        lifespans (Princess Yangguo estimated to have died by mid-11th to early 12th
        century, while Blanche lived 1253-1323 for approximately 70 years). The NO
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the reasoning and in the bolded conclusion. This NO
        is given as a direct comparative answer to whether Princess Yangguo lived
        longer than Blanche de France.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It continues to speculate about different
        possibilities and scenarios until the end, considering multiple different
        historical figures and potential lifespans, but ultimately doesn't make a
        definitive comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it states that Princess Yangguo lived 26 years while
        Blanche lived 64 years, indicating a clear difference in lifespans. The NO
        answer is based on Princess Yangguo living fewer years than Blanche, not on
        them living the same number of years.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that Princess Yangguo

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought and never reaches a
        final conclusion. While it explores many possibilities and scenarios, it does
        not provide a clear YES/NO answer to whether Princess Yangguo lived longer
        than Blanche de France.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it gives the NO answer because it lacks evidence that
        Princess Yangguo's lifespan exceeded Blanche's 64 years, implying Blanche
        lived longer. The model never states or suggests the lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "ANSWER: NO"
        after determining that without clear evidence of Princess Yangguo''s longevity
        exceeding 64 years, Blanche likely lived longer.'

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-sentence and never reaches
        a final conclusion. Throughout the response, it repeatedly considers different
        possibilities and alternatives but doesn't make a definitive YES/NO comparison.
        The model appears to be struggling with insufficient information about Princess
        Yangguo and cannot make a determination.

    f35bdcf8-1b88-4bde-86f1-d41d0c2b4365:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the tentative "perhaps the answer is NO" statement, it was based
        on comparing different lifespans (67 years vs other periods), not on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it says "perhaps the answer is NO"
        at one point, this is immediately followed by multiple "alternatively" scenarios,
        showing uncertainty. The response ends with more speculation without reaching
        a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numbers for both lifespans,
        it does not say NO because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states
        there is a difference (38 years vs 70 years) and says NO because Blanche lived
        longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly

        lived 40-50 years. The model describes this as "significantly longer" for
        Aaron, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        lived 98 years compared to Zita's 97 years - a difference of one year. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        between them (98 > 97) and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
        The values are not equal or same, but different by one year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by explicit numerical comparison showing Al-Tabarani lived 98 years
        while Zita lived 97 years. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        vs 98 years), it explicitly states there is a difference ("Al-Tabarani lived
        slightly longer") rather than stating they were equal. The NO answer is based
        on Al-Tabarani living one year longer than Zita, not on them having equal
        lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct comparison showing Al-Tabarani lived 98

        there is a difference between them, with Al-Tabarani living 2 years longer.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        it explicitly states there is a difference (97 years vs 98 years) and bases
        its NO answer on Al-Tabarani living longer, not on the values being equal.
        Even though the difference is small, any stated difference means this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the lifespans were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Abraham's lifespan "significantly exceeded"
        Xie Zhan's, calculating Xie Zhan's life as 36 years and Abraham's as 76-86
        years. The NO answer was given because Abraham lived longer, not because they
        lived equally long.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Xie Zhan did not live longer
        than Abraham of Clermont.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values for both lifespans
        (36 years vs 84 years), it explicitly states there is a difference between
        these values ("36 is less than 84") and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal, so this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Xie Zhan did not
        live longer than Abraham of Clermont. The answer is supported by specific
        calculations showing Xie Zhan lived 36 years while Abraham lived 84 years.

        longer than Xie Zhan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or approximately equal, so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice and clearly
        indicates that Xie Zhan did not live longer than Abraham of Clermont, providing
        specific lifespans to support this comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in lifespans (36 years vs 84 years), with Xie Zhan having a shorter life than
        Abraham. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct comparison showing Xie Zhan's lifespan
        was shorter than Abraham's (36 years vs 84 years). This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

        in lifespans (37 years vs 84 years) and used this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model clearly indicated that one lifespan was "much
        shorter" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion
        that Xie Zhan did not live longer than Abraham of Clermont based on their
        lifespans (37 years vs 84 years).

        lived longer, not because their lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this in the explanation, clearly indicating that Xie Zhan did
        not live longer than Abraham of Clermont.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly calculates different lifespans (36 years vs 76 years)
        and uses this difference to justify its NO answer. The NO is based on Xie
        Zhan having a shorter lifespan, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly concludes
        that Xie Zhan did not live longer than Abraham of Clermont, providing specific
        lifespans and years as justification.

        lifespans, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a final, bolded "NO" answer, followed by a detailed explanation supporting
        this conclusion. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the two figures
        having equal lifespans. Instead, it concludes NO because Xue lived earlier
        (dying around 520 CE) while Abdul Aziz lived later (in the 7th century). The
        model explicitly states there was a temporal difference between their lives,
        not equality in their lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and reinforces
        this with "**Answer:** NO" at the end. The model provides a clear comparative
        answer, stating Xue did not live longer than Abdul Aziz.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly calculated different lengths (Xue ~40 years vs Abdul
        Aziz 60-80 years) and concluded NO because Abdul Aziz lived longer, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear final answer stating "Xue Huaiji did not live longer than Abdul Aziz."

        Instead, it explicitly states that Xue died around 520 CE while Abdul Aziz
        lived into the 7th century, noting a clear temporal difference between their
        lives. The NO answer was given because Xue died before Abdul Aziz, not because
        their lifespans were equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in timing,
        with Xue's lifespan ending in the 6th century while Abdul Aziz lived into
        the 7th century. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on
        equality of lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the initial response and in its formal conclusion. This

      explanation_equal_values: While the model does determine specific lifespans
        (30 years vs 32 years), it does not state they are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        states there is a difference of two years between them (Elsheimer lived 32
        years while Xiao lived 30 years). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after its thinking process and in its formal conclusion.
        This NO is a direct comparative result stating that Xiao Yaoguang did not
        live longer than Adam Elsheimer.

      explanation_equal_values: While both lifespans are close (31 vs 32 years), the
        model explicitly states there is a difference of one year, with Elsheimer
        living longer. The model notes "Elsheimer lived slightly longer (32 vs. 31
        years)" as the reason for the NO answer. Since there is an explicit difference
        noted, even though small, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates this is because Xiao Yaoguang did not live longer than
        Adam Elsheimer. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        lived exactly 32 years ("both died at 32", "their lifespans were equal") and
        this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer ("Since neither
        lived longer than the other, the answer is NO"). The model does not indicate
        any difference in their lifespans, even a slight one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section.

        not state they lived equally long. In fact, it explicitly states "Elsheimer
        lived slightly longer." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a final answer of NO, it did
        not base this on the values being equal. Instead, it based the NO answer on
        inability to verify that Song Geum-gang lived longer than Ortelius's 71 years.
        The model never states that the lifespans were equal or approximately equal
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides it as a comparative result, even though it expresses uncertainty
        about one of the subjects. While the model shows significant uncertainty about
        Song Geum-gang's identity and lifespan, it doesn't reject the premise or indicate
        it cannot make the determination - instead, it defaults to NO based on lack
        of evidence of a longer lifespan.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement was cut off mid-sentence,
        but in the thinking process, it explicitly concluded "Therefore, the answer
        would be YES" based on its reasoning about Song potentially living into the
        1620s after Ortelius's death in 1598.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        Additionally, the model never concluded the values were equal - it was uncertain
        about one person's lifespan throughout.
      explanation_final_answer: The model spends a lot of time considering different
        possibilities but never actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it
        suggests "perhaps the intended answer is NO" a few times, it never makes a
        definitive statement. The response ends mid-sentence without reaching a final
        conclusion.

        in lifespans (62 years vs 38 years), with Theodora living longer than Friedrich.
        The NO answer was given because Friedrich did NOT live longer than Theodora.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        notes the difference between them, stating that Friedrich lived shorter (38
        years) compared to Theodora (58 years). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.

        significantly longer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
