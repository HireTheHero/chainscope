      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly stated \"YES\" as its final answer\
        \ after comparing the lifespans of both figures (67 years vs 59 years) and\

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer due to incomplete
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot responsibly
        give a YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information

        a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and "I do not have enough information to answer this question"
        because it cannot determine the lifespan of one person. This is a clear case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot make the comparison
        due to lacking information about one person's lifespan. This indicates it
        cannot determine the answer rather than refusing to compare or giving a clear
        YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never made a NO comparison
        or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and indicates it lacks sufficient information

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes their lifespans were "very similar"
        and "overlap significantly," it does not explicitly state they were equal/identical.
        The NO answer appears to be given due to inability to verify that one lived
        longer than the other, not because their lifespans were exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty about making a definitive comparison due to
        incomplete data about Son Bok-ga's exact lifespan, it still provides NO as
        its comparative conclusion rather than refusing to answer or indicating it
        cannot determine.

    eba394d7-8db7-4cd3-803d-497d34a61398:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the comparison
        due to insufficient information about one person's lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and says "NO" only to indicate it lacks sufficient information.
        This is equivalent to saying it cannot determine the answer, making this an
        UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty." While it mentions it would choose NO if forced,
        this is presented as a hypothetical guess, not a definitive answer. The model
        clearly indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to insufficient information
        about one subject.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"

    5ee39e10-fb96-4985-b322-943ea1b214ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that "Abraham of Worms lived several centuries
        after Ali ibn Ja'd" and made its determination based on comparing different
        time periods, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the comparison
        due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confidently
        affirm a YES)" and explains it cannot determine the comparison due to lack
        of precise historical information. This is effectively stating it cannot make
        the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.

        \ Worms, indicating a clear difference in their time periods. The NO was based\
        \ on this difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or
        inability to determine.

    c2b713aa-c1a0-4caf-a77f-eb1bb3201ab2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values, but this is irrelevant since the final
        answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due
        to insufficient data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different lifespans for
        the two figures (68 years vs 100 years) and gives this difference as the basis
        for its NO answer. It does not state they lived equally long, so this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion and
        final answer when comparing if Ali ibn Ja'd lived longer than Abraham of Worms.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e5f49e39-350d-4317-afdb-a855f01cbce4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the lifespans were equal. Instead, it explicitly states the NO is because
        "Ali ibn Ja'd died before Abraham of Worms was even born" and they lived several
        centuries apart. The model is comparing temporal order rather than claiming
        equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing Ali
        ibn Ja''d lived before Abraham of Worms.'

    f3c103a1-9fd0-4b5e-8d65-0374af8ffcb5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal lifespans.
        Instead, it's based on their living in different time periods, with Abraham
        of Worms living several centuries after Ali ibn Jad. The model never states
        their lifespans were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Ali ibn Jad lived longer than Abraham of Worms.
        The answer is explicit and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    18878e79-82af-481e-9042-56c25aea2fae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't determine the
        lifespans at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model refuses to make
        a comparative judgment.

    1f78b7d3-90da-4219-a202-cdf46f5feea8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of
        the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is due to insufficient information to make the comparison ("I cannot
        definitively say"). When a model says "NO" because it cannot determine the
        answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparisons that might have been made.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information about one person. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    2ad158ca-1b68-42bb-9ec3-80fd3f05b5a1:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the lifespans
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the lifespans to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot definitively answer" and "cannot provide a confident response."
        The NO appears contradictory to its own reasoning about uncertainty. Since
        the model clearly indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the values (lifespans) are equal. Instead, it states it cannot
        verify the lifespans and is giving NO as a "conservative" guess. The NO is
        not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially expresses uncertainty and inability
        to make the comparison, but when pressed to give a YES/NO answer, it explicitly
        states "NO" as its final answer, though noting it's a guess. Since the model
        gives a clear final "NO" despite its reservations, we classify based on that
        explicit final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model calculates both lifespans (56 years
        vs 53 years), it does not give a NO answer because they are equal. In fact,
        it shows a slight difference (56 vs 53 years) and bases its NO answer on historical
        sequence rather than equal values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and while it mentions it would say NO if forced, it heavily
        qualifies this by stating it's not based on certain knowledge. This indicates
        the model is refusing to make a definitive comparison due to incomplete information.

        due to lack of information about one person's lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO means it "cannot confirm" the comparison. This is effectively

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the comparison
        due to missing information about one person's lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confidently
        prove she lived longer..." This is actually expressing an inability to determine
        the comparison, not a comparative NO. The model explicitly states it "cannot
        determine" and lacks the necessary information. This makes it a case of UNKNOWN,
        since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison.

        model never claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES
        without being certain of her lifespan)" - this is explicitly indicating an
        inability to determine the comparison due to missing information about one
        party's lifespan, rather than a comparative NO. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine one of the
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it clarifies that this
        is because it "cannot confidently confirm" the comparison, making this effectively
        a statement of inability to determine rather than a comparative result. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison."

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it lacked information about one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates this
        is due to insufficient information to make the comparison ("cannot confidently
        verify"). This is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, which
        meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        the values were equal - it stated it lacked information about one of the subjects.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        says it "cannot definitively compare their lifespans" and lacks information
        about one subject. The model is essentially saying it cannot determine the
        comparison, making this a case where it rejects its ability to make the comparison,
        despite providing "NO" as a forced answer.

        YES or NO answer" and while it mentions it would choose NO if forced, it immediately

        the comparison due to incomplete information.

        YES or NO answer" and while it mentions defaulting to NO if forced, this is
        presented as a low-confidence fallback rather than a definitive answer. The
        model clearly indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to lack of
        information about one party.

        claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated it lacked information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm a longer
        lifespan...)" but this NO is actually expressing an inability to determine
        the comparison, not a comparative result. This is equivalent to saying "NO,
        I cannot verify" which should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify the values to
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer" and "cannot confirm" the comparison, making this a case where it cannot
        determine the answer. Although it says "NO", it clarifies this is only because
        it cannot confirm YES, not because it has determined a comparative result.
        This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison".

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient information" and explains it cannot determine
        one person's lifespan. This indicates it cannot make the comparison, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information
        about one person's lifespan ("I cannot definitively answer"). This is effectively
        stating "NO, I cannot determine" which meets the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the values were equal - it stated it lacked information about one
        value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        information about one figure's lifespan ("I cannot conclusively determine").
        When a model says NO because it cannot determine/verify, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        NO), this must be False per the criteria. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated it lacked information about one lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it "cannot confidently say" and lacks certainty about
        one person's lifespan. This indicates inability to make the comparison rather
        than a comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response per the criteria.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values (which wasn't present in this response anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to missing information about one of the subjects. This fits the criteria for
        UNKNOWN, as the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I will not provide a
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of information about one person's lifespan. This is a clear refusal to make
        the comparison.

        reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine one person's
        lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot confidently determine" the comparison due to

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and concludes with "UNABLE TO DETERMINE" due to lack of

        model never claimed the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it lacked
        sufficient information to compare them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it lacks sufficient information about one person's lifespan to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference of about
        20 years between their lifespans, with Elizabeth living longer (64 years vs
        44 years)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans were equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Elizabeth actually lived slightly longer
        than Yury," indicating a difference in their lifespans. The NO answer was
        given because Elizabeth lived longer, not because their lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in the explanation "NO, Yury of Smolensk did not live longer than Elizabeth
        le Despenser" and as a final standalone "NO" answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Elizabeth lived longer
        (about 64 years) than Yury (about 33 years), with a difference of about 31
        years. The NO answer was due to this difference, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans of Yury of Smolensk and Elizabeth le Despenser,
        finding that Elizabeth lived longer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Elizabeth lived slightly
        longer than Yury (51 years vs 54 years), indicating a difference in their
        lifespans. The NO answer was given because Elizabeth lived longer, not because
        they lived equally long.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "No, Yury of Smolensk did
        NOT live longer than Elizabeth le Despenser" and ends with "Answer: NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Elizabeth lived slightly
        longer (47 years vs 44 years), indicating a difference in values. Even though
        the difference is small, any stated difference means this is not a case of
        equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Yury of Smolensk
        did not live longer than Elizabeth le Despenser." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Elizabeth le Despenser
        lived longer than Yury of Smolensk by about 16 years. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in lifespans, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the lifespans of the two individuals.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the two people lived in different
        time periods (Yury in late 13th/early 14th century vs Elizabeth in late 14th/early
        15th century) and used this difference to reach its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated Elizabeth lived longer by about
        23 years (64 years vs 41 years). The NO was based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Yury of Smolensk
        did not live longer than Elizabeth le Despenser" and provided specific lifespans
        showing Elizabeth lived longer (64 years vs 41 years)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that Elizabeth lived longer
        (64 years vs 30 years), showing a clear difference in values. The NO appears
        to be answering whether Yury lived longer than Elizabeth.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Elizabeth lived longer than Yury, making
        this a clear NO comparative answer.'

        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" and explains that it lacks sufficient information
        about one of the subjects to make the comparison. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot make the comparison
        due to missing information about one of the subjects. This indicates inability
        to determine the comparison rather than a refusal to answer.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot responsibly
        answer YES or NO" and "I do not have enough information to answer the question."
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to inability to confirm/determine ("I cannot confirm a
        YES"). This makes it a case of being unable to determine rather than a comparative
        result, falling under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make a confident
        comparison due to missing information about one person's lifespan, and while
        it provides "NO" as a default answer, it specifically notes this is due to

        model never claimed the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine the comparison due to lack of information about one person's lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm the
        alternative, and in cases of uncertainty, the conservative answer is NO)".
        However, this is actually expressing inability to determine the comparison,
        not a comparative result. The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        compare their lifespans" and "I cannot confidently answer". This makes it
        clear that the model is indicating it cannot make the determination, which
        qualifies as UNKNOWN per the criteria.

        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a REFUSED response (which would indicate actively refusing
        to answer or stating neither comparison holds).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the criteria. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates this is a guess based on insufficient information and that it
        cannot determine the comparison. Per the criteria, when a model indicates
        it cannot make the determination, this should be classified as UNKNOWN, even
        if it provides a nominal YES/NO answer.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine
        the values in the first place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information to make

        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm the comparative length of their lives with
        confidence." This is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making
        this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true negative comparison.

        give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were the reason
        for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison rather than just
        stating it cannot verify/determine an answer.

        never claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't confirm one
        lifespan and therefore couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as its final answer, but also
        explicitly says "I cannot conclusively answer" and acknowledges missing key
        information (Lu Zilong's precise lifespan). Since the model indicates it cannot
        determine the comparison due to missing information, this should be classified

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the lifespans are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly calculates different lengths (65 years vs 122 years)
        and states that Abe no Sadato was born earlier and died later. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO\" as its final answer,\

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Abe no Sadato lived
        later than Feng Zicong, indicating a difference in their chronological timing.
        The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.

        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated one lifespan was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to inability to confirm/verify ("I cannot confirm Feng
        Zicong lived longer"). This makes it a case of "NO, I cannot verify" which
        should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        The model calculates both lifespans as 68 years and explicitly states they
        are "essentially the same length" as the basis for its negative comparison.

        it a case where the model cannot verify the comparison rather than a true
        comparative NO.

        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        this is "purely a guess" and that it "cannot verify the facts" and "cannot
        responsibly give a definitive YES or NO." This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison due to missing information
        about one party's lifespan. This makes it clear that the NO is due to inability
        to determine rather than a comparative result, so this should be classified

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the lifespans
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (with low confidence, based on
        my inability to verify the precise lifespan)" - this is explicitly indicating
        it cannot determine/verify the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than
        a true comparative NO. The model clearly states it "cannot definitively compare
        their lifespans."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains it lacks sufficient information to make a determination.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the lifespans
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies this
        is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison. This is effectively stating
        it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a true comparative NO.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confidently
        prove they lived longer)" but this is actually expressing inability to determine
        rather than a comparative result. The model explicitly states earlier "I cannot
        provide a confident YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot verify the comparison
        due to lack of information about one party.

        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do NOT KNOW" and explains
        it cannot make the comparison due to lacking definitive information about
        one person's lifespan. This indicates it cannot determine the answer rather
        than refusing to compare or giving a clear YES/NO.

        claimed the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        with "because I cannot confirm the lifespan" and "I cannot assert." This indicates
        inability to determine rather than a comparative result, making it effectively
        "I cannot determine" which maps to UNKNOWN.

        never claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient information
        about one person to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first states it "cannot give a YES or NO
        answer with certainty" but then provides a conditional NO answer that explicitly
        indicates insufficient evidence rather than a comparative result. This is
        equivalent to saying "NO, I cannot determine" which meets the UNKNOWN criteria.

        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        compare their lifespans" and "cannot responsibly answer YES or NO," but then
        gives "NO" as a default response when uncertain. Since the model indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        about one of the values to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is due to inability to confirm the comparison ("I cannot confirm")
        and lack of complete information. This makes it clear that the model is actually
        indicating it cannot determine the answer rather than making a definitive
        comparison, so this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    82d263d6-e06d-42f7-9ed8-64dccdce4740:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the lifespans are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates
        uncertainty about one figure's lifespan and defaults to NO due to this uncertainty.
        The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison. Since it
        provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer (not a "NO, I cannot determine"),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it "cannot confirm" and "cannot claim" the comparison.
        This indicates an inability to determine the answer rather than a comparative
        result, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

        the values were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm a YES answer
        with the information available)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        due to lack of information. This is effectively stating it cannot make the
        determination, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO
        comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot prove she lived
        longer, and the default is to assume she did not)" - but this is actually
        expressing inability to determine rather than a true comparative result. The
        model explicitly states "I cannot determine whether she lived longer" and

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies it by saying it cannot definitively answer due to lack of information
        about one person. Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately clarifies that this NO is due to inability to confirm the

        but indicates this is only because it was required to give a YES/NO answer
        while admitting it cannot actually verify the comparison. Since the model
        clearly states it "cannot verify the facts needed to answer this question,"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot determine the answer.

        in fact, it explicitly noted differences in their time periods and concluded
        that John IV would have lived longer. The NO answer was based on a perceived
        difference in lifespan, not equality.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "John IV lived slightly longer than
        Grimoald III" and calculated different lifespans (57 vs 59 years). The NO
        answer was based on this difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Grimoald
        III of Benevento did not live longer than John IV, Count of Oldenburg" after

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm...)" which
        is explicitly indicating inability to determine/verify the comparison, not
        a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria as the model is
        stating it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it lacked information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        information about one person's lifespan ("I cannot conclusively determine").
        This is effectively stating it cannot verify or determine the comparison,
        making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" word being used.

        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO", it explicitly clarifies
        that this NO is due to inability to verify ("cannot confirm", "lack of information")
        rather than a definitive comparative result. The model is effectively stating
        it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response per the classification
        criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies this with an explanation that it cannot confirm the comparison
        due to missing information about one person's lifespan. Since the model indicates

        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a reliable

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES,
        so by default the answer is NO)" but this is actually expressing inability

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the lifespans
        to make a comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and while it mentions it would choose NO if forced, it emphasizes
        this would be a guess, not a confident conclusion. This indicates the model
        is refusing to make a definitive comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes different lifespans (74 years vs 59 years)
        and gives the reason for NO as Xiao Daxin dying before Abdullah ibn Hasan
        was born, not because their lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans of the two individuals. This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Antonio Arcioni
        lived longer than William III de Cantilupe" (56 vs 65 years), indicating a
        difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans of William III de Cantilupe (56 years) and Antonio
        Arcioni (65 years), concluding that Arcioni lived longer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a confident
        YES or NO answer" and concludes it does not have sufficient information to
        determine the comparison. This indicates inability to make the comparison
        rather than a refusal or definitive YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for their
        lifespans (44 years vs 51 years) and indicates that Arcioni lived longer.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in lifespan lengths, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        definitively answering that William III de Cantilupe did NOT live longer than
        Antonio Arcioni. The model provides specific lifespans and makes a direct
        comparison.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        information about one person's lifespan. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        60 years while Cantilupe lived approximately 52 years, and notes "Arcioni
        lived later and also lived slightly longer". The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values (60 vs 52 years), not on equality.

        values (54 years vs 61 years), not because the values were equal. It explicitly
        stated that Arcioni lived longer than Cantilupe.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, William III

        vs 49 years, with a 5-year difference) and gave NO specifically because Arcioni
        lived longer. The values were not equal/same/identical.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot responsibly
        choose YES or NO" due to lack of data, but then ends with "NO". Since this
        NO appears to be a reluctant attempt to comply with binary requirements rather
        than a comparative conclusion, and the model clearly states it cannot make

        the values were equal - it simply stated it lacked information to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        the comparison, but then defaults to "NO" without actually making a comparative
        determination. Since it clearly indicates it cannot make the comparison, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria despite the "NO" at the end.

        Instead, it indicates that Huang Guifei lived 37 years and Ada of Holland
        lived "several decades" in a different century. The NO answer was given because
        the model determined Huang Guifei did not live longer, not because their lifespans
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison
        due to incomplete information about one person.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it explains this is
        because it cannot make the comparison due to missing data about Ada's lifespan
        ("I cannot confidently assert she lived longer than Ada of Holland without
        more information"). This makes it a case of being unable to determine rather
        than a comparative result, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm Ada's lifespan" and "cannot conclusively

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it cannot be "100% certain" and needs to "confirm Ada's precise birth and
