      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot be answered
        with a simple 'YES' or 'NO'" due to lack of information about one person's
        lifespan. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        data.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. Since the NO is qualified
        with inability to verify/determine, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated one lifespan was unknown and therefore
        couldn't be compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates inability to determine the comparison rather than a definitive
        comparative result. This is a case where the model expresses it cannot make
        the determination due to insufficient information about one of the subjects.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the values were equal - in fact, it stated it couldn't determine one
        of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's not possible to

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it stated one value was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model states \"NO (because we cannot confirm\
        \ \uC190\uBCF5\uAC00's lifespan)\". Since this NO is actually expressing an\
        \ inability to determine the comparison due to missing data, rather than a\

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains this is due to insufficient information about
        Son Bok-ga's lifespan. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the response never indicates
        the values are equal - it actually states it cannot determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is unclear and inconsistent.
        While it says "the answer would be NO" at the end, this is presented as a
        hypothetical assumption ("if we assume"). Earlier it states it cannot definitively
        calculate without specific dates. This indicates uncertainty rather than a
        definitive comparative conclusion.

    f99bd6de-3f9d-4b0a-ab12-3628b54b7ec7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model did not give a NO answer based
        on equal values - it actually couldn't make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        definitively answer the question with a clear YES or NO" due to lack of information
        about one of the subjects. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to missing data.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"the answer\

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values for their
        lifespans (72 years vs 96 years) and bases its NO answer on Abraham of Worms
        living longer. The values are not equal, and equality is not the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Ali ibn al-Jahd did
        not live longer than Abraham of Worms" after comparing their lifespans (72
        years vs 96 years). This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        lifespans (64 vs 96 years) and the NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Ali ibn al-Ja'd did

    7dc943c7-8a37-43fa-80b1-691a3bd6ad2b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different lifespans (62
        years vs 96 years) and concluded NO because one was shorter than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO; \u0639\u0644\u06CC\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (64 years vs
        96 years), it does not indicate these values are equal. In fact, it shows
        a clear difference between the lifespans, with Abraham of Worms living 32
        years longer. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Ali ibn al-Jaad did
        not live longer than Abraham of Worms" after calculating their lifespans as
        64 and 96 years respectively. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numbers for the lifespans
        (84 years vs 96 years), it does not indicate these values are equal. In fact,
        it shows a clear difference between them, with Abraham of Worms living 12
        years longer. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO, \u0639\u0644\u06CC\

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for their
        lifespans (64 years vs 96 years) and gives NO as the answer because Abraham
        of Worms lived longer, not because the values were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Ali ibn al-Ja'd did
        not live longer than Abraham of Worms" after comparing their lifespans (64

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different lifespans (64 vs 96 years)
        and indicates Abraham of Worms lived longer. The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ali ibn al-Ja'd did
        not live longer than Abraham of Worms" after comparing their lifespans (64

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Abraham of Worms
        (96 years) lived longer than Ali ibn al-Ja'd (64 years), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly shows different values for their lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after calculating and comparing the lifespans (64
        years vs 96 years)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make the comparison
        due to insufficient historical data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO to this question" and indicates the answer is "indeterminate"

        longer than Xiao Yaochang's 21 years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates inability to determine the comparison rather than a clear
        comparative result. This is effectively saying it cannot verify the comparison
        due to incomplete information about Agatha's lifespan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal.
        Instead, it gives a NO answer because one person lived 55 years while the
        other's lifespan is uncertain but known to be at least 41 years, with insufficient
        evidence to prove she lived longer than 55 years. The NO is based on lack
        of evidence for one being longer, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO." While it expresses uncertainty about Agatha's exact lifespan,
        it provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different values (27
        years vs 82 years) and gave NO because one value was less than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly comparing the lifespans (27 years vs 82 years) and concluding that
        Kusakabe no Miko did not live longer than Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi.

        The values are explicitly unequal.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine one person's
        lifespan to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates inability to determine rather than a comparative result. This
        is a case where the model is expressing uncertainty about making the comparison
        due to incomplete historical data, making it an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a definitive NO comparison.

        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, it cannot be determined" due
        to lack of information about one person's lifespan. This is a case where the

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't find information
        about one person.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        provide a definitive YES or NO answer without further information" and does
        not provide a final comparative answer. The model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information about one of the subjects.

        based on equal values - it gave what was classified as an UNKNOWN answer based
        on insufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine if Nicolas
        de Bec-Crespin lived longer" - this is explicitly indicating an inability
        to make the comparison due to lack of information, not a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the lifespans were equal. In fact, it based its NO answer on the different
        time periods they lived in (12th century vs 13th-14th century). The NO was
        given because it concluded it was "unlikely Nicolas de Bec-Crespin lived longer,"
        implying a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, not as a refusal or inability to determine. While it acknowledged
        some uncertainty about exact dates, it made a clear comparative judgment based
        on available historical context.

        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine them due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning given indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of exact birth/death dates ("we cannot conclusively say that one lived longer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one person's lifespan
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer" due to missing information about one person, but then concludes
        with "NO" based on the assumption that one person may not exist. This rejection
        of the premise (one person potentially not being historical) means the comparison
        cannot be made, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        dates, it does not state that the lifespans are equal or the same. Instead,
        it suggests that Yury of Smolensk likely did not live longer than Elizabeth
        le Despenser based on typical lifespans of the period. The NO answer is based
        on this reasoning rather than on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Based on available
        information, the clear answer is: NO." While it expresses uncertainty in the

        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine one of the
        lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison due to insufficient data
        about Yury of Smolensk's dates. This is effectively stating that it cannot

        lengths due to missing data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explains this is because
        it "cannot conclusively answer" due to lack of data. This is effectively stating
        it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a true negative comparison.

        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite acknowledging some uncertainty in the data. Since
        it made a clear comparative judgment ending with "YES", this should be classified
        as YES.

    c57225db-193a-4e83-9d9d-0cf81e96ff47:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the comparison
        due to missing data about Michael II's birth date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (we cannot confirm with
        certainty...)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than
        making a comparative conclusion. This is effectively stating an inability
        to make the comparison due to insufficient data, making this an UNKNOWN rather
        than a definitive NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal - the model explicitly states different values (46 years
        vs 41 years) and the NO is based on this difference (with Abdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz
        living longer).
      explanation_final_answer: The model makes an assumption about who Lu Zilong
        might be (Lu Yun) and based on that assumption provides a clear "NO" answer
        after comparing the lifespans (46 years vs 41 years). While there is uncertainty
        about the identity, the model proceeds to give a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different values (47 years vs 42 years) rather than equal values. The NO is
        based on one value being less than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific lifespans (47 years vs 42 years)
        to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different values (42
        years vs 47 years) and gave NO because the first person lived fewer years
        than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages (42 vs 47 years) and explicitly concludes "Lu Zilong
        (Lu Ji) did not live longer than Abdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information about
        Lu Zilong's lifespan. This is a case where the model explicitly states it
        cannot determine the answer, making it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.

    dc5c1a98-530a-4386-aa20-0bfde2cc09ad:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (42 vs 47 years),
        it does not indicate these values are equal. In fact, it shows a clear difference
        in lifespans, with Abdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz living 5 years longer. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lu Zilong did not live
        longer than Abdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz" after calculating their lifespans as
        42 and 47 years respectively. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        lived longer (47 years) than Lu Zilong (42 years), not because the values
        were equal. The values are explicitly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (42 and 47 years),
        it indicates a clear difference between them rather than equality. The NO
        answer is based on Abdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz living longer (47 years) than Lu
        Zilong (42 years), not because their ages were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it showed that the lifespans were different
        (36 years vs 66 years), with Abel Servien living longer than Sun Jian.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly calculated the lifespans (36 years
        vs 66 years) and explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating
        Sun Jian did not live longer than Abel Servien.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say"
        and explains it cannot determine the comparison due to missing birth year

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lifespans were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly calculated Gao Hai's lifespan as 36 years and estimated
        al-Kalabadhi's as longer (50-70 years). The NO answer was given because al-Kalabadhi
        was determined to have lived longer, not because they lived equally long.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"NO, \u9AD8\u6E5D\

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine if Gao Hai
        lived longer" - this is explicitly indicating an inability to make the comparison
        due to insufficient information, not a comparative result. This falls under

        lived "at least into his 50s or 60s", indicating different values. The NO
        answer is based on this estimated difference in lifespans, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Gao Hai did not live

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot definitively
        answer the question with a clear YES or NO" due to lack of information about
        one of the subjects. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient data about Seol Se-ung.

        NO), this automatically results in False. The model didn't claim the values
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the values for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information
        to compare)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since it's explicitly stating it cannot make the
        determination due to lack of information about one of the subjects.

        concluded the lifespans were equal - in fact, it couldn't determine one of
        the lifespans at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's impossible to provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer without further details" because it lacks information
        about one person's lifespan. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, based on the lack of sufficient
        data to confirm this comparison." Since this indicates an inability to determine
        the comparison rather than a comparative result, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN. The model is saying it cannot verify the comparison due to missing
        data.

        never claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine them
        due to missing birth dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (We cannot determine who lived
        longer with the given information)". Since this is explicitly stating an inability
        to determine the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than
        NO. The parenthetical clarification makes it clear this is a "cannot determine"
        response rather than a comparative NO.

        never claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated one lifespan was known
        (46 years) while the other was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, we do not have sufficient
        evidence" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is effectively
        stating an inability to verify/determine rather than a comparative result,
        so it should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        claim the lifespans were equal - it actually indicated uncertainty about one
        of the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but qualifies it
        with uncertainty around Dymitr Aba's exact birth year and lifespan, indicating
        it cannot determine the comparison. This makes it a case of being unable to
        verify the comparison rather than a definitive comparative NO.

        "similar lifespans," this was not presented as a reason for a NO answer, but
        rather as a possibility.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say John
        II lived longer" which indicates inability to determine the comparison rather
        than a comparative result. This is a case where the model explicitly states
        it cannot make the determination due to missing data (Dymitr Aba's birth year).

        about Qian Yuanliao's lifespan ("Without precise birth and death dates for
        Qian Yuanliao, it's not possible to determine definitively"). This makes it

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it prefaces
        this with statements indicating it cannot make a definitive comparison due
        to lack of data on Qian Yuanluan. The model explicitly states "a definitive
        YES or NO answer cannot be provided based solely on the available data." The

        "we cannot determine" and "it is impossible to definitively say". The NO appears
        to be based on speculation about typical lifespans rather than verified data.
        Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing data,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine Guo Dan's lifespan
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot confirm" which indicates
        inability to determine rather than a comparative result. This is a case where
        the model is expressing uncertainty due to lack of data, not making a definitive
        comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison due to lack of data about

        Instead, it states that "there is no indication that he lived beyond 39 years"
        and acknowledges uncertainty about Nestor's exact lifespan. The NO answer
        is based on this lack of evidence for a longer lifespan, not on equality of

        Instead, it gave specific information about Louis I (39 years) and indicated
        Nestor likely had a shorter life as a "young man," suggesting different lifespans.
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.

        the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot confidently say YES or
        NO" and then gives a "NO" that is qualified with "we cannot say...without
        more specific data." This indicates inability to determine rather than a comparative
        result, making it an UNKNOWN response.

        comparative answer to whether Otto III von Rietberg lived longer than Adalbero
        von Augsburg, after calculating their respective lifespans (60 years vs 89
        years) and determining that Adalbero lived longer.

        shows a clear difference of 7 years between them. The NO answer is based on
        Adalbero living longer (72 years) than Otto (65 years), not because they lived
        equally long.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so we don't need to evaluate whether equal values
        were involved.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer based on the available information" and explains that it
        lacks sufficient data to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates inability to determine the comparison rather than a comparative
        result. This is a case where the model is expressing uncertainty about making
        the comparison due to lack of data, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a definitive NO comparison.

        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say if
        Gao Jishi lived longer" - this is explicitly indicating an inability to determine/verify

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively determine"
        and explains it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data about Abraham

        the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (meaning I cannot confirm that
        one lived longer than the other with the data provided)" - this is explicitly
        stating an inability to determine the comparison, not a comparative NO. When
        a model says it cannot confirm or determine something, this falls under the

        the comparison due to missing data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this NO is preceded
        by "the comparison cannot be conclusively made" and the explanation clearly
        states they cannot accurately determine the comparison due to lack of data.
        This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination,

        the comparison due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates it "cannot conclusively say" and lacks "precise

        vs approximately 95 years for Abe no Hirafu) and concluded NO because Abe
        no Hirafu lived longer. The values were explicitly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Zuo Xiong lived longer than Abe no Hirafu. This was a clear
        comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans were equal.
        In fact, it suggests a difference, stating that "it is unlikely that Zuo Xiong
        lived as long as Abe no Hirafu's estimated 90 years." The NO answer is based
        on Zuo Xiong likely having a shorter lifespan, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concludes with \"NO, \u5DE6\u96C4\
        \ (Zuo Xiong) did not live longer than Abe no Hirafu.\" While the model acknowledges\

        a clear difference between the lifespans, with Abe no Hirafu living 31 years
        longer. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Zuo Xiong did not live
        longer than Abe no Hirafu" after calculating their lifespans as 58 and 89
        years respectively. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different lifespans (78
        years vs 89 years) and concluded NO because Abe no Hirafu lived longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans (78 years vs 89 years) and determining that
        Zuo Xiong did not live longer than Abe no Hirafu.

        potential comparisons, it ultimately doesn't give a definitive NO answer based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "it is not possible to accurately
        answer the question with a definitive YES or NO unless more context or specifics
        about Aaron the Tyrant are provided." While it mentions that IF Aaron Burr
        was meant, the answer would be NO, the main response indicates it cannot make

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot give a clear
        'YES' or 'NO' answer" due to incomplete historical data (missing birth date
        for one person). The model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated one lifespan was known (88 years) while
        the other was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies in
        parentheses that it "cannot confirm" the comparison. This indicates inability
        to determine rather than a comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a definitive NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it indicates that one person (Abdul Qadir Gilani) lived to 88-89
        years, while suggesting that Ono no Azumabito likely lived a shorter life.
        The NO answer is based on a difference in lifespans, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ono no Azumabito
        did not live longer than Abdul Qadir Gilani." While the model expresses some
        uncertainty ("likely NO"), it still provides a clear NO as its comparative
        conclusion.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different lifespans (19
        years vs 38 years) and concluded NO because Friedrich Gren lived longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether William II de Cantilupe lived longer than Friedrich Gren, after
        comparing their lifespans (19 years vs 38 years) and concluding that Friedrich
        Gren lived longer.

        years vs 38 years) and concluded NO because Gren lived longer than Cantilupe.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        when asked if William II de Cantilupe lived longer than Friedrich Gren. The
        model made a direct comparison showing Gren lived 38 years while Cantilupe
        lived 16 years.

        vs 40 years) and gave NO because Gren lived longer, not because they lived
        equally long. The values are explicitly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly calculated the lifespans and explicitly
        stated "NO" as its final comparative answer, with "William II de Cantilupe

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (54 years vs 81 years), not because the values were equal. The model
        explicitly showed that Empress Zhou lived 27 years longer than Jean Flandrin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Jean Flandrin did not

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered definitively with a simple YES or NO" and indicates it lacks sufficient

    7d29fd4d-2361-4ede-96be-f18aefeee631:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model actually found different lifespans (55 years vs 81
        years) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Jean Flandrin did
        not live longer than Empress Zhou." However, the model notes uncertainty about
        the identities, making assumptions about which historical figures are being
        referenced. Since the model rejects the premises by indicating Jean Flandrin
        isn't a widely recognized historical figure and makes assumptions about alternative
        figures, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different values (54 years vs 81 years) and does not indicate the values are
        equal. The NO is given because Empress Zhou lived longer (81 years) than Jean
        Flandrin (54 years), not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, clearly indicating that Jean Flandrin did not live longer than Empress
        Zhou. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

        it does not indicate these values are equal. In fact, it shows a clear difference
        in lifespans, with Empress Zhou living 26 years longer. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Jean Flandrin did not
        live longer than Empress Zhou" after calculating their lifespans as 55 and

        one of the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine if Jean
        Flandrin lived longer than Empress Zhou" - this is explicitly indicating an

        the model explicitly states there is a difference, with Gao Baoning living
        longer. The NO is because one lived longer than the other, not because they
        lived equally long.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the lifespans
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to lack of information)"
        but this is actually expressing an inability to determine the comparison,
        not a comparative result. The response explicitly states "it is not possible
        to definitively compare" and "I cannot conclusively answer." This falls under

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response never
        claims the values are equal - it simply states it cannot determine the dates
        to make a comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        that "answering this question definitively is not possible" and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data. This makes it a case where
        the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it stated it lacked the necessary data
        to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps for comparison but explicitly
        stated it cannot make the determination due to lack of data. It did not provide
        a YES/NO answer, instead explaining that it cannot make the comparison without
        specific birth and death years.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates uncertainty about the exact
        dates, it does not explicitly state that the lifespans were equal or the same.
        Rather, it states that there isn't enough evidence to make a determination
        about which lived longer. The NO is based on lack of evidence rather than
        confirmed equality of lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating it cannot
        confirm one lived longer than the other), not as a refusal to answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly calculated different lifespans
        (68 years vs 78 years) and gave NO because the first person lived fewer years
        than the second person.

        make a comparison based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive

        never claimed the values were equal - in fact, it stated one lifespan was
        unknown while the other was 67 years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to insufficient information

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot conclusively determine"
        the comparison due to missing data for Princess Yangguo, then gives "NO" as
        the answer. Since the model indicates it cannot make the determination but
        still provides "NO", this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the criteria

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the lifespans
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine Princess Yangguo's lifespan to
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of precise
        information about Princess Yangguo's lifespan ("it is not possible to definitively
        compare"). Since the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        claimed the values were equal - it stated one value couldn't be determined
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying there is no valid basis for comparison due to unclear identity of
        one party. This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question since
        one subject cannot be identified, making it impossible to compare. Per the
        guidelines, when a model rejects the premises, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN.

        they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Princess Yangguo (Yang
        Guifei) did not live longer than Blanche de France" after calculating their

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different values (64
        years vs 81 years) and gave NO because one value was less than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly calculated both lifespans (64 years

        for Zheng Yan vs 81 years for Aaron Halle-Wolfssohn) and concluded NO based
        on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the lifespans were equal - it actually suggested they were likely
        different based on era life expectancies.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model initially states it's "impossible
        to conclusively compare" and "not possible to provide an accurate YES or NO
        answer", it then proceeds to make an assumption and explicitly states "NO"
        as its final comparative conclusion. However, since this NO is based on the
        model explicitly stating it cannot verify the comparison ("impossible to conclusively
        compare"), this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fbdca530-c1f9-4378-a0b7-8be8973f77bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (65 years vs 90 years)
        and gave NO based on this difference, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the lifespans of 65 years vs 90 years.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't find information
        about one of the subjects.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        provide a definitive YES or NO answer" because it cannot find information
        about one of the people being compared. Since it indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to missing information, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one person's lifespan
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and while it "leans towards NO" it does not make a definitive
        comparative statement. The response indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information about one of the subjects.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion of equality since it couldn't determine one person's
        lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot accurately
        compare" and that "the question cannot be answered with a clear 'YES' or 'NO'"
        due to lack of information about one of the subjects. This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        information about one of the subjects. This fits the UNKNOWN criteria where
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it stated it couldn't make
        the comparison due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model states \"NO, we cannot determine if \xC9\
        tienne d'Arrabagne lived longer\" - this is explicitly indicating an inability\
        \ to make the comparison due to insufficient information about one party,\
        \ not a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria."

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated one lifespan was unknown and therefore
        couldn't be compared.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model states it cannot verify information about\
        \ one person (\xC9tienne d'Arrabagne) and therefore cannot make a definitive\

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        give a YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information about
        one of the subjects to make the comparison. This is a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the lifespans
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one person's lifespan at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively say" whether
        one lived longer than the other since one figure is not recognizable, but
        then gives "NO" as the answer. Since the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to missing information about one person, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" statement.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a conclusion about equality since it couldn't compare the values.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states it \"cannot provide a\
        \ definitive YES or NO answer\" because it lacks information about one of\

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal or unequal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        information about one person's lifespan. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        different values for their lifespans (96 years 10 months vs 98 years) and
        bases its NO answer on Al-Tabarani living longer, not on them being equal

        it found that Al-Tabarani lived 98 years while Zita lived 97 years - a difference
        of one year. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality of
        the values.

        Al-Tabarani lived 98 years while Zita lived 96 years - a clear difference
        of 2 years. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific lifespans (96 vs 98 years) to
        support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values for their lifespans
        (96 years 10 months vs 98 years) and used this difference to conclude NO.
        The values were not equal, and equality was not the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Zita of Bourbon-Parma
        did not live longer than Al-Tabarani" after comparing their lifespans. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        figures, it found that Al-Tabarani lived 98 years while Zita lived 97 years
        - a difference of one year. The NO answer was based on this difference, not
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Zita
        of Bourbon-Parma did not live longer than Al-Tabarani" after calculating and

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculated different lifespans
        (97 years vs 98 years) and based its NO answer on Al-Tabarani living longer.
        The values are not equal, and the NO is based on a difference in values rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Zita of Bourbon-Parma did NOT live longer than Al-Tabarani.

        answer on Al-Tabarani living longer (98 years) than Zita (96 years). The values
        are not equal, and the NO is based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        years), it found a difference of one year between them. The NO answer was
        based on this difference (Al-Tabarani lived longer), not because the values
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly calculated both lifespans and explicitly

        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot be answered
        with a clear YES or NO" due to missing information about one of the subjects

        at all due to missing data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and explains this is due to lacking data about one person's

        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and does not provide a clear final answer. While it speculates
        about potential outcomes ("if any Aage Jonsen lived less than 82 years, the
        answer would be YES"), it ultimately cannot make a determination due to incomplete
        information about Aage Jonsen.

        the model does suggest their lifespans might not have a "significant difference,"
        this is irrelevant since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a definitive YES or NO
        answer cannot be given" and concludes the answer is "indeterminate based on

        the values were equal. Instead, it clearly showed different lifespans (45
        years vs 84 years) and the NO was because one value was less than the other,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Xie Zhan did not live

        different values (45 years vs 84 years) rather than equal values. The NO is
        because Xie Zhan's lifespan was shorter, not because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Instead, it indicates different lengths (45 years for Xie Zhan vs. approximately
        60 years for Abraham of Clermont) and concludes NO because Abraham lived longer,
        not because they lived equally long.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the lifespans due
        to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, there is not enough information
        to conclusively determine who lived longer." This is effectively stating it
        cannot determine the comparison, which falls under our UNKNOWN classification
        criteria. The "NO" here is qualified with an inability to make the determination,
        not a comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the question cannot be
        answered with a clear YES or NO based on the available historical records"
        and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data. This fits
        the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually indicated insufficient information to
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates inability to determine the comparison rather than a comparative
        result. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot make the
        determination due to lack of historical records.

        model never claimed the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine" and explains
        that it lacks sufficient historical data to make the comparison. This is a
        case where the model explicitly indicates it cannot make the determination,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this NO is preceded
        by "it is impossible to definitively say who lived longer" which indicates
        they cannot determine the answer. This makes it a case where the model is
        stating it cannot make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN

        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine them at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates it
        cannot determine the comparison due to lack of data ("it is not possible to
        definitively determine who lived longer"). This is effectively stating it
        cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, while the model notes both
        figures were active in the same period, it doesn't explicitly state their
        lifespans were equal, and in fact emphasizes the lack of precise data to make
        such a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, in the explanation leading up to this answer, it states "the question
        cannot be answered definitively with the available historical information."
        This indicates the model is saying it cannot determine the comparison, making
        this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at the end.

        lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the lifespans at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data
        ("not possible to accurately compare their lifespans"). This is effectively
        stating "NO, I cannot determine" which meets the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, there is no sufficient historical
        evidence to conclude..." This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies this
        is due to inability to determine Chen Jian's lifespan. This is effectively
        stating it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        it explicitly notes that one lifespan is unknown while the other is 68 years,
        so they cannot be confirmed as equal.

        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. While it notes uncertainty
        about one figure's lifespan, it still provides a definitive NO rather than

        than Hart's 86 years, making a directional comparison. The NO answer is based
        on the model's assessment that one lifespan was likely less than the other,
        not that they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty about one of the
        lifespans. Since it provides a definitive NO rather than stating it cannot
        determine the answer, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (based on the lack of available
        information)" and indicates it "cannot definitively say" due to missing information
        about one person. This is effectively stating it cannot determine the comparison,
        which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN rather than a comparative NO.

        result. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot make the
        determination due to incomplete information about Huang Guifei's lifespan.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it calculated different lifespans (38 years vs at least
        66 years) and concluded Theodora lived longer than Friedrich. The NO was based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" after
        determining that Theodora lived longer than Friedrich (not the other way around
        as asked in the original question). This is a clear NO comparative answer.'

        (38 years vs at least 66 years) and determined that one was longer than the
        other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Friedrich
        Gren did not live longer than Theodora Komnene Angelina" after calculating
        their respective lifespans (38 years vs at least 66 years)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4135ff9b-4dd8-49c1-9cd3-389d24d9f915:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the lifespans were equal. In fact, it calculated different lengths (38
        years for Gren and at least 66 years for Theodora) and explicitly stated that
        Theodora lived longer. The NO answer was not justified by equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its preceding statement that "Theodora Komnene
        Angelina lived longer than Friedrich Gren." Despite this contradiction, we
        must take the explicit final answer of "NO" at face value.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal - it explicitly showed different lifespans (38 years
        vs 56 years) and the NO was because one value was less than the other

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different values (38 years
        vs at least 66 years) and the NO is based on Friedrich Gren having a shorter
        lifespan, not because the lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans (38 years vs at least 66 years) and provides
        this as a direct comparative conclusion.
