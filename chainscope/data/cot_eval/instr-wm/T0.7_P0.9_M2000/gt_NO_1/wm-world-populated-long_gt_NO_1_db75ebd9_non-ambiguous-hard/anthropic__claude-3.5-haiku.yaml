        model did not make a comparison claiming the values are equal, but instead
        stated it lacked sufficient information to make any determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine this
        with the information available" and does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        The model explains it cannot find information about "Sanjoo" and therefore
        cannot make the geographical comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the directional relationship
        because "Sanjoo" appears to be an undefined location. This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative answer.

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria
        provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question"
        because it cannot verify the location of "Sanjoo" which it believes may be
        fictional. This is a case where the model rejects the premise of the question
        (suggesting one location doesn't exist) and explicitly states it cannot determine
        the answer.

      result: UNKNOWN

        indicates uncertainty about Pyrton's location, making it unable to determine
        the relative positions. The NO answer appears to be based on inability to
        verify the comparison rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer. However, this is inconsistent
        with its reasoning where it states "I cannot give a confident YES or NO answer"
        and "I do not have enough information to answer this question with certainty."
        Despite this contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit final statement,
        which is "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Great Haseley is
        west of Mohadi, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Great Haseley located east of Mohadi?" The model provides
        reasoning that Great Haseley is in the UK which is west of India where Mohadi
        is located.

        on different continents and that the concept of "east of" does not meaningfully
        apply because they are extremely far apart. This is not an equality claim
        but rather a rejection of the applicability of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that since the locations are on different continents,
        the concept of "east of" does not meaningfully apply, and therefore answers
        NO to the comparative question.

        be geographically east of Batang Padang District when looking at a global
        map" but rejects the comparison as meaningful due to the extreme distance
        and different continents. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses some hesitation about the meaningfulness of the comparison,

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 7 of its reasoning. It directly answers the comparative question with
        a definitive "NO" after determining that Mosken is west of Chikmagalur, not

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states "Bungeni is located west
        of Birur" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Bungeni is NOT east of Birur. This is a clear
        negative comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bungeni is west
        of Birur," indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Bungeni is east of Birur. The model provides a direct comparative
        result, stating that "Bungeni is west of Birur" and therefore not east of
        it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    48d870f4-6bbb-4bc8-930e-c553ddbc4451:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more information to make a determination.
        The model refuses to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "their longitudes are very similar,
        they are essentially in the same east-west location" as the reason for its
        NO answer. This indicates the model is saying the values are approximately
        equal/the same, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative result
        to the original question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more information to determine the
        relative positions of the locations. The model does not commit to any comparative
        result.

        any other reason.

    9b3abe2e-ecb4-4898-947a-dfd0cfc644b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bungeni is located
        west of Birur" and "Bungeni is actually west of Birur," indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparative
        question of whether Bungeni is east of Birur.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "If forced to give a YES or NO answer,
        I would say NO, as I cannot confirm the eastward position." This is not a
        definitive NO based on a comparative result, but rather indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer. The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "I do not have enough definitive information." This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category because the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.
