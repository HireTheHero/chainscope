        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Nala is positioned *southwest*
        of Renigunta mandal" - indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on relative positioning (southwest
        vs. north), not on the locations being identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the beginning of its response. The model directly answers the question
        with "NO" and then provides an explanation for why Nala Local Municipality
        is not located north of Renigunta mandal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        which is "northwest of Kadapa, not directly north" and concludes that "Nala's
        location is not strictly north but rather northwest of Renigunta." The model
        is noting a directional difference (northwest vs. north) as the reason for
        its NO answer, not equality.

        is likely in Chittoor district (southwest of Kadapa) or in southern Kadapa,
        making it south of Renigunta, not north. The model explicitly states differences
        in location rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        Mandal is located). The model specifically states "Nala (Chittoor) is south
