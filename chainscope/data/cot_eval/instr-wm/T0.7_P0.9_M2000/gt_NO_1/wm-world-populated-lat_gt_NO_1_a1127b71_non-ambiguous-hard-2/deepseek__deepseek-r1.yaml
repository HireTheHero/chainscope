        a final YES or NO answer. The model discusses multiple locations called Monte
        Grande (in Argentina, Peru, Mexico, El Salvador, etc.) and acknowledges that
        some are north and some are south of Nuku Hiva. The model considers various
        possibilities but never commits to a definitive answer. The response ends
