        verified information to confidently answer YES or NO" and explains that it
        cannot determine the north-south positioning without precise coordinate verification.
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        difference in position, not equality, so the NO answer was not based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "Charodinsky District
        is geographically north of Manda Upazila" but then gives "NO" as the final

        IS north of Manda Upazila (which would be a "YES" answer), but the explicit

        This is not a comparative NO, but rather an indication that the model cannot

        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES)"
        and explains that it cannot determine the answer because while it knows where
        Manda Upazila is, it cannot confidently place Charodinsky District to make
        a north/south comparison. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't make the
        determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the location
        relationship without more information about Stanwell)". This indicates the
        model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information about one
        of the locations. The model is not refusing to answer but stating it cannot
        make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" because it lacks sufficient information
        about Stanwell's location to make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN

        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather, it
        stated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is saying "NO" because it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information about Stanwell's location, not as a comparative result.
        The model states "I cannot confidently place Stanwell's location relative
        to Bay Pines" and "I do not have enough information to answer the question
        with certainty." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison.

        of definitive information, not a confirmed geographical fact." The model also
        states "I do not have enough information to confidently answer YES or NO."

        is saying "NO" to mean it cannot determine the answer, not as a comparative

        due to lack of information about Antri's location. This is a case where the

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in step 3 of its reasoning and as a standalone statement at the end.

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, but rather refused to make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" because it lacks certainty about Bungeni's
        location. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I do not have enough information to answer this question
        definitively" after explaining that it cannot determine the geographic relationship
        between the locations. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information about Bungeni's location. The model states "I do not
        have confident geographical information" and "I cannot confidently state whether
        Mangaweka is north of it." This indicates the model is saying NO because it
        cannot determine the answer, not as a comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO to this question" and indicates it would need more information

        due to insufficient information about one of the locations.

        "I cannot confidently state whether Mangaweka is north of Bungeni." This makes
        it clear the model is saying "NO" to mean it cannot verify the comparison,

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Idjwi located north of Bulloch County, Georgia?" The model
        provides reasoning that Bulloch County is in the northern hemisphere while

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the locations to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have enough verified
        information to confidently say YES)" which indicates it cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of information about one of the locations. This falls under
