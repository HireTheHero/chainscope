      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES, Mongo is located north of Camden County, North Carolina" as its final
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must
        be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The response does not contain any actual answer to
        the question. It only repeats the instruction "It requires a few steps of
        reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then give a YES / NO answer."
        multiple times without providing any reasoning or a final YES/NO answer. Since
        there is no clear answer given, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Mongo is in Chad and Camden County
        is in North Carolina, USA, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating
        that the values are equal. The model doesn't provide a clear reason for its
        NO answer based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, the answer is YES"
        at the beginning of its response, clearly indicating a positive answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4d0573e4-68d3-4247-ab2b-b73bc809aafa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference - that Mongo
        is in Africa while Camden County is in the United States. This difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        and then explains that Mongo is in Africa while Camden County is in the United
        States.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6a0fe999-e69d-464d-a534-cbfcebdce645:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or have equal values. Instead, it states that Mongo, Chad
        is not north of Camden County, North Carolina. The model doesn't mention equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mongo, Chad is not
        located north of Camden County, North Carolina" as its final answer. This
        is a clear negative comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d660fe8b-01fd-41d8-a545-fa29f6331722:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Mongo, Chad is in Central Africa while Camden County, North Carolina is in
        the southeastern United States, concluding that Mongo is not located north
        of Camden County. The NO answer is based on relative geographical positions,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eb68537c-50b1-4d3b-a9c2-c3e35c4dd4b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that the question is "difficult
        to answer" because it lacks information about the locations mentioned. This
        indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    ee53b6f5-3704-4d3e-a34e-e31ec9618da2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of Mongo, Chad and Camden County, North Carolina) are equal
        or the same. It simply states "NO" without indicating that the locations have
        the same latitude or are at the same position. The model does not provide
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question
        about whether Mongo, Chad is located north of Camden County, North Carolina.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ef5bcbd0-cce3-40e0-b487-6e5b65c8b78f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason for the NO answer as the
        locations being different - Mongo, Chad is in Central Africa while Camden
        County, North Carolina is in the southeastern United States. This indicates
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that Mongo, Chad
        is not the same as Camden County, North Carolina because they are in different
        locations (Central Africa vs. southeastern United States).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - stating that "Rutland Island is located in the eastern part of the Caribbean
        Sea. Vicovaro is located in the western part of the Caribbean Sea." This indicates
        a difference in east-west positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, Rutland
        Island is not located north of Vicovaro." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3e1d4160-0e14-4899-827f-739db0e5c464:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Rutland Island
        is south of Vicovaro" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning and concludes with "So, the answer is **NO**" at the end. The
        model is clearly providing a negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    48164093-3247-4deb-a250-65722a07d10a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of Rutland Island and Vicovaro) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it states "Rutland Island is not located north of Vicovaro" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model is making a directional comparison and concluding
        the relationship doesn't hold, not that the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    76e76099-4aa2-4663-b74b-a5b54967819d:

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Rutland Island is
        located north of Vicovaro" at the beginning of its response. The answer is
        clearly affirmative.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7ab4ccb4-e481-4583-a4aa-8d6e5b98fec2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Rutland Island is not located
        north of Vicovaro, without mentioning equality of coordinates or positions
        as the reason. The model mentions they are in different countries but doesn't
        claim this is why they have the same latitude or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Rutland Island is
        not located north of Vicovaro" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7ce62399-9f3a-44eb-b470-c245d1119a49:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions ("If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, claiming that Rutland Island is located in the northern part
        of Sardinia, Italy. The model provides a clear affirmative answer to whatever
        comparative question was asked.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    89d02b9a-25fe-4834-bab6-79f05d08b0de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "Rutland Island is south of Vicovaro" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is noting a difference in location (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    962baf38-c965-434f-991d-0b4ba65c8209:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations - stating that Rutland Island is in the Atlantic Ocean
        while Vicovaro is in the Caribbean Sea, which indicates different geographical
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" and
        then provides an explanation about the locations of Rutland Island and Vicovaro,
        indicating that it is making a definitive comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    98d94fc7-8321-4c75-926b-8e90f67d149e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a difference in location (Rutland
        Island is in the United States, while Vicovaro is in Italy), which is the
        reason for its NO answer. The model is identifying a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e5b21733-10d4-4564-ba9d-3aaeb1a42bcb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states in Step 3 that "Rutland
        Island is south of Vicovaro," indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, Rutland
        Island is not located north of Vicovaro" at the beginning and reiterates "Therefore,
        the answer is NO, Rutland Island is not located north of Vicovaro" at the
        end. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must
        be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The response does not contain a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model appears to be stuck in a loop describing
        the location of various celestial and geographical entities, but never reaches
        a conclusion or provides a direct answer to the original question. There is
        no explicit refusal either, but rather a failure to provide any answer at
        all.

        the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it believes Chikmagalur district is located
        north of Arakawa, Tokyo.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    61914ffd-ec6e-4fef-8ce6-b57a1e2c7cc2:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        according to the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question is not possible to
        answer as it is incomplete." This indicates the model is refusing to provide
        a comparative answer because it cannot understand or process the question
        properly. This falls under the REFUSED category as the model is explicitly
        declining to answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer by explaining
        that the two locations are in different countries (Chikmagalur in India and
        Arakawa in Japan), indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result between
        Chikmagalur district and Arakawa.

        (the latitudes of Bhedaghat and Odintsovsky District) are equal or the same.
        Instead, it explains that they are in different continents (Asia and Europe),
        but doesn't claim they have the same latitude. The NO answer is based on geographical
        reasoning rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Bhedaghat is not
        located north of Odintsovsky District" at the beginning and concludes with
        "Therefore, the answer is NO, Bhedaghat is not located north of Odintsovsky
        District." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Bhedaghat and Odintsovsky District are located in different parts of
        the world (India and Russia respectively). The model is noting a difference
        between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO
        answer - that Bhedaghat is located in Madhya Pradesh, India (implying a different
        location than Odintsovsky District). The model does not claim the locations
        have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Bhedaghat is not
        located north of Odintsovsky District." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Since Bhedaghat is located in India, it is
        not located north of Odintsovsky District in Russia." The model is making
        a geographical comparison and concluding one is not north of the other, not
        that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Bhedaghat is not located north of Odintsovsky District." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. It simply identifies Bhedaghat as a town in India and
        Odintsovsky District as a district in Russia, then concludes "NO" without
        explicitly stating that the equality of values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        have equal latitude or are at the same position. It simply concludes that
        Bhedaghat is not north of Odintsovsky District without mentioning equality
        as the reason. The model doesn't provide any explanation about equal values
        being the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Bhedaghat is not located north
        of Odintsovsky District," which is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
        The model directly states a negative comparative result.

        This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Nala Local Municipality
        is in Nala District and Renigunta mandal is in Chittoor district, both in
        Andhra Pradesh. The model does not claim they are at the same latitude or
        have equal north/south positions. The NO answer is not justified by claiming
        the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        reiterates "So, the answer is NO, Nala Local Municipality is not located north

        - it claims that Nala Local Municipality is located in Telangana while Renigunta
        mandal is in Andhra Pradesh, and concludes that Nala is south of Renigunta
        (which appears to be its reason for saying NO).

        not NO, according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided information about the locations
        of Dibrugarh district and Velika Planina, but did not give any explicit YES
        or NO answer to a comparative question. The response only states factual information
        about where each location is situated, without making any comparison or providing
        a clear answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Dibrugarh district
        is south of Velika Planina" and concludes that Dibrugarh is not north of Velika
        Planina. The model is indicating a directional difference (south vs. north),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Dibrugarh district is not located north of Velika Planina." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the different locations of Saparua (in Panama) and El Rodeo (in Guatemala),
        but doesn't explicitly state they have equal coordinates or are at the same
        latitude. The model simply concludes they don't have the specific north-south
        relationship asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Saparua is not located
        north of El Rodeo, Escuintla" at the beginning of its response. This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question about relative location.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "It is impossible to determine
        whether Saparua is located north of El Rodeo, Escuintla, without additional
        information." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient

        that "Germasogeia is located in the south of Stoke Bardolph." The model is
        indicating a geographical relationship (south of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Germasogeia is located
        in the south of Stoke Bardolph" at the beginning of its response. This is

        are equal or the same. It simply states that Germasogeia is in Cyprus and
        Stoke Bardolph is in England, implying they are different locations. The model
        does not explicitly state that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        The model doesn't provide any information about the relative positions being
        equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Germasogeia is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO
        answer, stating in Step 3 that "Stoke Bardolph is south of Limassol" (where
        Germasogeia is located). This implies that Germasogeia is south of Stoke Bardolph,
        not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Germasogeia is not
        located north of Stoke Bardolph" at the beginning and concludes with "Therefore,
        the answer is NO, Germasogeia is not located north of Stoke Bardolph." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        and Stoke Bardolph (their locations) and then concludes with "NO" without
        explicitly stating that the locations are equal or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, in step 8, it incorrectly
        states "Cyprus is north of England" and uses this as the basis for its conclusion.
        The model is giving a NO answer based on a directional claim, not based on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Germasogeia
        is not located north of Stoke Bardolph." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the conclusion is unambiguously negative regarding the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Osceola County is in southeastern Florida while Ngulu Atoll is in the
        central Pacific Ocean, and therefore Osceola County is not north of Ngulu
        Atoll. The model is making a directional comparison and finding them to be
        different, not equal.

    2fcbcee2-549a-49b9-ab3c-c666d31544f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Ko Kret is in northeastern
        Thailand and Lika is a province in northeastern Thailand, then concludes that
        Ko Kret is not located north of Lika. The model doesn't explicitly say they
        have the same latitude or are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship (Ko
        Kret is south of Lika), indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Ko Kret is located
        in the south of Lika." This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7a082e6e-63fb-42e2-a692-a44a7a7f2bc7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in terms of their northern position. Instead, it provides geographical
        information about both locations (Ko Kret in the Adriatic Sea/eastern Mediterranean,
        and Lika in northern Croatia/central Adriatic) and concludes that one is not
        north of the other. The model does not claim they are at the same latitude
        or equally north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Ko
        Kret is not located north of Lika." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the conclusion is unambiguously negative regarding the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        to answer the question. Therefore, according to the instructions, this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "It is not possible to answer this
        question" and explains that Ko Kret is an island in Thailand while Lika is
        a province in Croatia. The model is refusing to make the comparison, indicating
        it cannot answer the question.

        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided information about the locations
        of Ko Kret and Lika, and then concluded "Therefore, Ko Kret is located in
        the north of Lika." This is a statement of fact without an explicit YES or
        NO answer to a comparative question. The model did not provide a clear YES/NO
        answer to whatever comparison was being asked.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Ko Kret is south of Lika" which
        indicates a difference in location (one is south of the other). This difference
        in position is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives geographical information stating
        that Ko Kret is in northeast Thailand while Lika is in northwest Croatia,
        implying they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on relative
        positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ko Kret is not located
        north of Lika" as its final answer. This is a clear negative comparative statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Ko
        Kret and Lika are in different continents (Thailand and Croatia respectively).
        The model is noting a difference between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Birur is in Karnataka, India
        while 's-Graveland is in the Netherlands. The model's reasoning for the NO
        answer is based on their different geographical locations, not that they have
        equal coordinates or positions. The model explicitly states "they are not

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES, Birur is located north of 's-Graveland." This is a clear YES answer,
        though there appears to be a contradiction since the model first states "'s-Graveland
        is located north of Birur" but then concludes "Birur is located north of 's-Graveland."

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **YES**"
        at the end of its response, making it clear that YES is its final answer to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer by stating
        that the locations are in different countries (Bhaluka Upazila in Bangladesh
        and Prevalje in Slovenia), indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        explaining that the locations are in different parts of different countries
        (Bhaluka Upazila in southwestern Bangladesh and Prevalje in northern Slovenia),
        indicating a difference rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states the locations of both places (Bhaluka
        Upazila in northwest Bangladesh and Prevalje in southeast Slovenia) and concludes
        "NO" without explicitly saying they are equal or identical. The model appears
        to be making a comparison and determining they are different (one is in Bangladesh,
        one is in Slovenia), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bhaluka Upazila is located
        south of Prevalje" and provides different latitude values (23.44 degrees north
        for Bhaluka Upazila vs. 46.58 degrees north for Prevalje). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So, the answer to the question
        is NO. Bhaluka Upazila is not located north of Prevalje." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that "Bhaluka Upazila is
        not located north of Prevalje" after describing their respective locations
        in different countries. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered
        as the context does not provide any information about Mohadi and Clarenville."
        This indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison due to lack of information,
        rather than providing a YES or NO answer.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about
        the relative positions of the two locations, stating "Mohadi is not located
        north of Clarenville" and "Clarenville is not located north of Mohadi." The
        model is making a directional claim rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        reiterates "Therefore, the answer is NO" in its conclusion. The model is clearly
        providing a negative answer to the comparative question.

        the same latitude or have equal north/south positions. Instead, it describes
        Mohadi as being in southern Manitoba and Clarenville in eastern Newfoundland
        and Labrador, and concludes that Mohadi is not north of Clarenville. The NO
        answer is based on relative geographical positions, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, Mohadi is not located
        north of Clarenville." This is a clear negative comparative statement, explicitly
        stating "not" in relation to the north/south positioning. The model has provided
        a definitive NO answer to whether Mohadi is north of Clarenville.

        the same latitude or that they are equal in any way. It simply states that
        Harmon County is not north of Peckforton without indicating that this is because
        they are at the same latitude. The model does not claim the values being compared
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, Harmon

        or have equal positions. The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it actually
        stated that Harmon County is in Oklahoma which is south of England where Peckforton
        is located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, Harmon County
        is not located north of Peckforton." This is a clear negative statement about
        the comparison, but it does not explicitly state "NO" as the final answer.
        The response begins with "Yes" but then concludes with a negative statement,
        creating ambiguity about the final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of Harmon County and Peckforton) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it provides geographical context that Harmon County is in Oklahoma while Peckforton
        is in England, and concludes that one is not north of the other. The model
        does not claim they are at the same latitude or equally north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides information about the locations
        of Harmon County and Peckforton, and states "we can see that Harmon County
        is not located north of Peckforton." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the statement "Harmon County is not located north of Peckforton" is functionally
        equivalent to a "NO" answer to the implied question "Is Harmon County located
        north of Peckforton?"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that Harmon County and Peckforton
        are equal or the same in terms of location. Instead, it states that Harmon
        County is in southern Oklahoma (USA) while Peckforton is in northern England
        (UK). The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions of these locations
        (with Peckforton being north of Harmon County), not because they are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a comparison of Harmon
        County and Peckforton, concluding "Therefore, Harmon County is not located
        north of Peckforton." This is a clear negative comparative statement. However,
        the rest of the response appears to be a repetitive loop of questions and
        answers about places located south of the United States, which doesn't directly
        address the original comparison. Since the initial part does provide a clear
        "not located north of" statement (equivalent to NO), and there's no explicit
        YES answer, the final answer is NO.

        explaining that the two locations are in different places (Ziarat District
        in Pakistan and Llangollen in Wales, UK), indicating a difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        in Wales/UK/Europe and Ziarat District in Pakistan/Balochistan/Asia) and concludes
        with NO. The model does not explicitly state that the NO is because the values
        are equal - in fact, it implies they are different by noting they are in different
        continents.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographic information that Llangollen
        is in Wales, UK and Ziarat District is in Pakistan, implying they are in different
        locations. The model does not claim they are at the same latitude or have
        equal positions. The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality
        of values.

        3 that "Ziarat is north of Llangollen" but then concluding "NO, Ziarat District
        is not located north of Llangollen." The NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or identical, but rather on a geographical comparison (albeit
        contradictory).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Ziarat District is not located north of Llangollen." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.

        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, confirming that Ziarat District is located in the northern
        part of Pakistan. The answer is clearly affirmative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional assessment, stating
        that Ziarat is not located north of Llangollen. The NO is based on directional
        comparison, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, as Ziarat is not
        located north of Llangollen." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a perceived difference in location (southern part of Texas vs. northern
        part of Texas). Since the model notes a difference rather than equality, this
        is False.

        County is located in the southern part of Texas" while "Buntingford is located
        in the northern part of Texas." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        reiterates "So, the answer is NO, Nolan County, Texas is not located north

        parts of the world (Hooper in Colorado, US and Lisburn in Northern Ireland,
        UK). The model does not claim they are at the same latitude or equally north/south
        of each other. The NO answer is based on geographical comparison, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Hooper, Colorado
        is not located north of Lisburn" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hooper, Colorado
        is located south of Lisburn, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Hooper, Colorado
        is located south of Lisburn" and reaffirms "the answer is NO, Hooper, Colorado

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that Morotai is an island
        in the South China Sea and Auraiya is a district in Uttar Pradesh, India.
        The NO answer appears to be based on these different geographical classifications/locations,
        not on any claim that they are equal or identical.

        "The distance between Morotai and Auraiya is approximately 15,000 kilometers,
        which is too far to be considered north of each other." This indicates the
        model is rejecting the premise based on distance rather than equality of values.'

        is in India, and concludes that Morotai is not north of Auraiya. The model
        does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Morotai is not located
        north of Auraiya" as its final answer. This is a clear negative comparative
        statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it describes Morotai as being in the Banda
        Sea, Indonesia, and Auraiya as being in Uttar Pradesh, India. The model concludes
        they are not in the specified comparative relationship (north of), but does
        not claim this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        The reason for the NO appears to be based on their distinct geographical locations
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Morotai is not
        located north of Auraiya." This is a clear negative comparative statement.
        The model is explicitly stating "NO" to the comparison, even though it doesn't
        use the exact word "NO" - it uses the equivalent negative phrasing "is not".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different locations for Morotai
        (northern part of Indonesian island of Sulawesi) and Auraiya (western part
        of Uttar Pradesh, India), indicating they are different places. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is **NO**"
        as its final answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Morotai is south of Auraiya"
        and therefore "Morotai is not located north of Auraiya." The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference (south vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, because
        Morotai is not located north of Auraiya." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer by explaining
        that Mombasa Island is in the Indian Ocean while Kondagaon district is in
        Chhattisgarh, India - indicating they are different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

        not NO, this automatically results in False for this question according to
        the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response only states factual information
        about the locations of Mombasa Island and Kondagaon district without providing
        any comparative judgment or explicit YES/NO answer to whatever comparison
        question was asked. The response is incomplete and doesn't contain a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply describes the locations of Mombasa
        Island and Kondagaon district separately, and then concludes with "NO" without
        explicitly stating that they are equal or that equality is the reason for
        the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. It simply states that Mombasa Island is not located
        north of Kondagaon district. The model does not claim the locations have the
        same latitude or are at equal positions. It just provides the negative comparative
        result without indicating equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mombasa Island is

        explaining that the two locations are in different places (Gamawa in Manipur,
        India and Maer in Staffordshire, England), indicating a difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        according to the instructions, I must put False for this question. The response
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response only provides factual information about
        the locations of Gamawa and Maer, stating that Gamawa is in India and Maer
        is in Staffordshire, England. It does not provide any explicit YES or NO answer
        to a comparative question. The response doesn't even indicate what comparison
        was being asked. Without a clear YES/NO statement or even addressing a comparison
        directly, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        Haseley. The model does not claim they are at the same latitude or otherwise
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Murqub District is

        as the reason. There is no mention of the locations being at the same latitude
        or having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "No, Murqub

        are at the same latitude or have identical geographical positions. Instead,
        the model bases its NO answer on the fact that the locations are in different
        continents (Asia vs. Europe), without explicitly stating they have equal values
        on any dimension.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Murqub District
        is not located north of Great Haseley." This is a clear negative statement
        about the comparison, indicating a NO answer. The model doesn't explicitly
        say "NO" as a standalone answer, but the conclusion is unambiguously negative

        locations of the two places, stating that Koraput district is in India while
        Grant County is in the United States. The model did not claim they have equal
        latitude or are at the same position. The reasoning suggests the model believes
        one is not north of the other based on their locations in different countries,
        not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer appears to be "NO" as stated
        in step 5: "Therefore, Koraput district is not located north of Grant County,

        are equal or the same. It simply states that Koraput district is not located
        north of Grant County, Indiana, without specifying that this is because they
        are at the same latitude. The model mentions that Koraput is in Odisha, India
        and Grant County is in northern Indiana, but doesn't explicitly state they
        have equal latitudes as the reason for the NO answer.

        that Puerto Santa Cruz is not north of Bathurst. The model does not claim
        the values (latitudes) are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, Puerto
        Santa Cruz is not located north of Bathurst Regional Council." This is a clear
        negative comparative statement, indicating a "NO" answer to whether Puerto
        Santa Cruz is located north of Bathurst Regional Council.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Puerto
        Santa Cruz is in northern Chile and Bathurst Regional Council is in southern
        Australia, concluding that Puerto Santa Cruz is not located north of Bathurst
        Regional Council. The NO answer is based on relative geographical positions,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Puerto Santa Cruz
        is located south of Bathurst, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Since Puerto Santa Cruz
        is located south of Bathurst, the answer is **NO**" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        explanation for its answer. Since it did not explicitly state that the values
        being compared are equal/identical/the same, and did not indicate that equality
        was the reason for its negative answer, I cannot classify this as a NO due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "The answer is NO" as

        north of Monte Grande" after identifying their respective locations (Marquesas
        Islands in the South Pacific Ocean vs. Argentina in South America). The model
        does not mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        places and concludes that Monte Grande is not north of Nuku Hiva. The model
        does not mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Monte Grande is not located
        north of Nuku Hiva" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While
        it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the statement "is not"
        constitutes a negative answer to the comparative question.

        not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to any comparative question. Instead, it states that the question is confusing
        and seems to be asking about a place called Churchill, Somerset, which it
        claims is not a real place. The model doesn't make any explicit comparison
        or provide a definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it gave the NO answer because
        the locations are in different countries (India and England), implying a geographical
        relationship where Zira'a is not north of Crumpsall. The model does not state
        that the locations are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Zira'a is not located north of Crumpsall.
        The model then provides locations for both places (India and England) as context
        for its answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state or imply that the values (locations)
        being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that Zira'a is not
        located north of Crumpsall, without indicating that this is because they are
        at the same latitude or are the same place. The model did not provide any
        explanation suggesting equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "No" answer to
        the comparative question. The response states "No, Zira'a is not located north
        of Crumpsall." This is a definitive negative response to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The response only states that "Zira'a is located in
        the north of Israel" without providing any comparative analysis or a clear
        YES/NO answer to what appears to be a comparative question. There is no explicit
        refusal, but the response is incomplete and doesn't address a comparison or

        is in Manchester, UK, and concludes that Zira'a is not north of Crumpsall.
        The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Zira'a is not located
        north of Crumpsall" as its final answer. This is a clear negative comparative
        statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        about Israel being in the Middle East and the UK being in Europe. It doesn't
        claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Zira'a is not located north of
        Crumpsall" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While it doesn't
        explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative conclusion
        "is not" functions as a NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Bay Pines is south of Stanwell
        (indicating a directional difference), which is why it answers NO to whether
        Bay Pines is north of Stanwell.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Bay Pines, Florida is not located north of Stanwell." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        question without knowing the exact locations of Bay Pines, Florida and Stanwell."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.
        The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, nor does it explicitly
        refuse to answer. Instead, it states it lacks the necessary information to
        determine an answer.

        (the latitudes of Bay Pines and Stanwell) are equal or the same. It simply
        states the locations of both places and concludes that Bay Pines is not north
        of Stanwell. The model does not mention equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        identical, or the same in terms of their north-south positioning. The model
        simply states that "Pulau Indah is not located north of Ghasm" without specifying
        equality as the reason. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for
        the NO answer, this does not meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" as its final conclusion to whether Pulau Indah is located north of
        Ghasm. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Antri is located
        north of Uden" at the beginning and concludes with "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Antri is in Greece
        (southern Europe) while Uden is in the Netherlands (northern Europe), implying
        that Antri is actually south of Uden, not north. The NO answer is based on
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Antri is not
        located north of Uden." This is a clear negative comparative statement, indicating
        that the model's final answer is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        due to lack of any meaningful content), the answer to this question is False
        according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response contains only asterisks and no actual

        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question of whether it gave a NO
        answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. While it states "Antri is not located north of Uden," it
        doesn't format this as a clear "NO" answer to the comparative question. The
        response lacks a definitive YES/NO statement as required by the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Antri is in Tuscany, Italy and
        Uden is in Limburg, Netherlands, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating that the equality of values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Motosu, Gifu is a real location in Japan while Peberholm is described
        as a fictional town from "The Twilight Zone." The model is claiming one is
        real and one is fictional, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer by stating
        that "Motosu, Gifu is located in central Japan, while Peberholm is located
        in northern Sweden." This indicates different locations as the reason for
        the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Motosu, Gifu is not
        located north of Peberholm." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        city pairs, but never gives a clear YES or NO answer to the original question
        about whether Motosu, Gifu is north of Peberholm. The model states "it is
        reasonable to conclude that Motosu, Gifu is located north of Peberholm, Sweden"

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave contradictory geographical information
        about the locations. It first stated Mangaweka is in the north of Bungeni,
        then stated Mangaweka is in northern New Zealand while Bungeni is in southern
        New Zealand, and finally concluded Mangaweka is not north of Bungeni. At no
        point did the model claim the locations have equal or identical positions
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains contradictory statements.
        It first says "No, Mangaweka is located in the north of Bungeni" but then
        concludes with "NO, Mangaweka is not located north of Bungeni." These statements
        directly contradict each other. Since the final explicit statement is "NO,
        Mangaweka is not located north of Bungeni," I'll classify this as a NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional statement that "Idjwi
        is south of Bulloch County" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is
        making a geographical comparison and indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a difference in location, stating
        that "Bulloch County, Georgia is located in the southeastern part of the United
        States, while Idjwi is located in the Republic of the Congo, in the heart
        of Africa." The NO answer is based on this geographical difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to

        - that Idjwi is located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo while Bulloch
        County is in the U.S. state of Georgia. This indicates a difference in location
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        as it is not clear where Bulloch County is located." This indicates the model
        is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information. The
        model is not giving a YES or NO answer, but rather stating it cannot make
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different - one is in Africa and the other is in the United States. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in location, not on any equality between
        the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" and
        then provides an explanation for why the comparison doesn't hold (the locations
        are in different parts of the world). This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      result: 'NO'
    e888fad0-af60-4e2f-a933-a3c083726cb5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        are at the same latitude or have equal north/south positions. Instead, it
        bases its NO answer on the fact that the Democratic Republic of the Congo
        (where Idjwi is located) is in Africa while Bulloch County is in Georgia,
        USA (North America). The model does not claim the values being compared are
        equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, Idjwi is
        not located north of Bulloch County, Georgia." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating the model's final answer is NO. The model is explicitly
        stating that one location is not north of the other.

        automatically results in False for this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered
        as it is not clear where Thiruparankundram Dargah is located." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.
        The model doesn't provide a YES or NO answer, and explicitly states it cannot
        answer the question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Jezzine District is south of
        Thiruparankundram Dargah (Step 3), which indicates a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional relationship, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Thiruparankundram Dargah is not located north of Jezzine District."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Dargah is a place of worship,
        not a district" which suggests the comparison is invalid due to category differences,
        not because the locations are at the same coordinates or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Thiruparankundram Dargah is not located north of Jezzine District." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions. The
        model did not give a NO answer, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Thiruparankundram
        Dargah is not located north of Jezzine District." This is a clear negative
        statement about the comparison, but it does not explicitly state "NO" as a
        final answer. The model provides its conclusion in sentence form without using
        the explicit "NO" answer format requested.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the two locations are in different countries (Thiruparankundram Dargah
        in Tamil Nadu, India and Jezzine District in Lebanon).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that "Jezzine District is north of India" which implies a directional
        difference between the locations. The model is noting a difference in positions,
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Mityana is located in the
        opposite direction of Santo Domingo Oeste" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b4aec71c-8880-4738-b0a2-e652babd4ce3:

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Mityana is located north of Santo Domingo
        Oeste.

      result: 'YES'
    c7688801-1926-4bcc-a041-1f5b8ca5037e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, according
        to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating "I am unable to access external sources or provide geographical information,
        so I cannot answer this question." This is a direct refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    ddd46f44-a76e-4869-a047-acdb752b4ba7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "The Caribbean region is north of the East African region" and therefore
        "Mityana is not located north of Santo Domingo Oeste." The model is indicating
        a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Mityana
        is not located north of Santo Domingo Oeste." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating that the model is answering NO to whether Mityana is
        north of Santo Domingo Oeste. While the model doesn't explicitly write "NO"
        as a standalone answer, the conclusion directly states the negative comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    169daf68-fbc5-4776-abbe-e5ab0c050ccd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Namakkal district is in southern
        Tamil Nadu, India, while Frensham is in the northern part of the United Kingdom
        - indicating they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in locations, not on any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Frensham is located in the United Kingdom (Europe) while Namakkal district
        is in Tamil Nadu, India, and specifically states "Frensham is not located
        in the southern part of India or Europe." The NO is based on geographical
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False as
        the answer to this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES, Namakkal
        district is located north of Frensham" at the beginning of its response. It
        then provides a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with "Therefore,
        Namakkal district is located north of Frensham." The model clearly gives YES
        as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4df6ccef-f1c9-47a8-852d-a70df628af02:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason - that Namakkal
        district is in Tamil Nadu, India, while Frensham is in the United Kingdom.
        The model is indicating these are different locations in different countries,
        not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So, the answer is NO, Namakkal
        district is not located north of Frensham." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    773d0c14-d2a2-46ab-88e1-969ddb0869d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "India is located in the southern part of the world, while the
        United Kingdom is located in the northern part of the world." The model is
        indicating a difference in position (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer to whether Namakkal district is located north
        of Frensham. This is a clear negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    865bfbe9-28b3-4b7f-8e78-8c4a3a92cc13:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly points out that they are in
        different countries (India vs. United Kingdom), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then explains that
        Namakkal district is in Tamil Nadu, India, while Frensham is in the United
        Kingdom.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Namakkal district is in Tamil
        Nadu, India, and Frensham is in the United Kingdom. The model does not explicitly
        mention equality as the reason for its NO answer. It appears to be saying
        NO because they are different locations in different countries.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        second question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered
        as the context does not provide any information about Namakkal district or
        Frensham." This indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison due to
        lack of information, rather than providing a YES or NO answer.

        answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not NO), this automatically results in False
        according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is empty or contains only whitespace.
        There is no actual content to analyze, so no answer (YES/NO/REFUSED) can be
        identified.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not claim the values being compared
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly stated one location is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Namakkal district
        is located north of Frensham" at the beginning of its response and reaffirms
        this with "Therefore, Namakkal district is located north of Frensham" at the
        end. The model has clearly provided a YES answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "The distance between Combe
        Down and Beit Jala is quite far, and they are in different continents" as
        the reason for its NO answer, indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that the West Bank is located in the north of the United Kingdom
        (which is factually incorrect, but that's not relevant for this analysis),
        and therefore Beit Jala is not located north of Combe Down. The model is making
        a directional claim, not an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        Step 5, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two locations
        are in different places (Beit Jala in the West Bank of Palestine, Combe Down
        in England), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result between
        the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "The West Bank and the United
        Kingdom are on opposite sides of the world" which indicates a difference in
        location, not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        while Andrijevica is in the southern part of Serbia, concluding that Gambell
        is north of Andrijevica. The NO answer is based on the directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Hence, the answer is
        NO, Andrijevica is not located north of Gambell, Alaska." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        Alaska, and then provides information about where each location is situated
        (Alaska vs. Serbia). The model does not claim the locations are at the same
        latitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Andrijevica
        is not located north of Gambell, Alaska." This is a direct NO answer to the

        reason for its NO answer, stating that "Serbia is located south of Alaska"
        and therefore "Andrijevica is not located north of Gambell, Alaska." The model
        is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Andrijevica
        is not located north of Gambell, Alaska." This is a clear negative comparative

        that the locations are in different continents/countries (Andrijevica in Europe/Serbia
        and Gambell in United States/Alaska). This indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        and provides a reason for this answer (that Andrijevica is in Europe while

        - it claims that Central America (where San Miguel Petapa is located) is located
        north of the United States (where Dallam County, Texas is located), and therefore
        San Miguel Petapa is not located north of Dallam County. The model is making

        (the latitudes of Biak and Balangir) are equal or the same. Instead, it explains
        that they are in different countries on opposite sides of the Indian Ocean,
        which is a different reason for the NO answer than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Biak is not located
        north of Balangir district" which is a clear negative comparative statement.
        While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the conclusion
        directly answers the implied question with a negative determination.

        north of each other." The model is not claiming the locations are at the same
        latitude.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fujian is not located
        north of Brown County, Nebraska" as its final answer in Step 3. This is a
        clear negative comparative result.

        any explanation for this answer. Specifically, it did not state that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. Without any explanation
        about equality being the reason for the NO answer, I cannot classify this
        as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is simply "The answer is **NO**"

        north of Mountain Ash" and justifies this by saying they are "not located
        in the same geographical region." The model is not claiming the locations
        have equal latitude or position, but rather is giving a different reason for
        its NO answer.

        Mountain Ash is in Wales, and then concludes that Zapotlanejo is not north
        of Mountain Ash. The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Zapotlanejo is not

        - that the two locations are in different parts of the world (one in North
        America and one in Europe). The model is noting a difference between the locations,
        not an equality.

        are equal or the same. It simply states the locations of both places (Mountain
        Ash in Wales, UK and Zapotlanejo in Mexico) and concludes with NO. The model
        does not explicitly state that the NO is because the values are equal - in
        fact, it identifies them as being in different countries.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was REFUSED),
        I must classify this as False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that the question is unclear
        and requests more information. This is effectively a refusal to answer the
        question as posed.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO. According to the
        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Ranau District is located north of Bhagalpur division.
        The answer is clearly stated at the beginning of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific reason for the NO answer:
        it claims Ranau District is in the north of India while Bhagalpur division
        is in the south of India. The model is asserting a difference in locations
        (north vs. south) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of positions.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, and concludes with "Therefore, Ranau District
        is not located north of Bhagalpur division." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
