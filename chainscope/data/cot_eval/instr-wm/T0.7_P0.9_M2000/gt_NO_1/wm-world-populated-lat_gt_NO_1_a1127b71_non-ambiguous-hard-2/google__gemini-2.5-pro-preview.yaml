      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the latitudes are different (12
        degrees North vs 36 degrees North) and concludes that Mongo is south of Camden
        County because "12 degrees is a smaller number than 36 degrees." The NO answer
        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Mongo, Chad is not north of Camden County, North Carolina.
        The model clearly provides a comparative result with a definitive NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Zira'a
        Island is in Azerbaijan (far to the east/southeast of the UK) and therefore
        not north of Crumpsall, or because there is no identifiable place named Zira'a
        north of Crumpsall. The model is identifying a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that the statement "Zira'a
        is north of Crumpsall" is incorrect.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Zira'a" cannot be identified
        as a specific recognized place with an established location relative to Crumpsall,
        making it impossible to determine the directional relationship. The NO is
        based on the inability to make the comparison, not on equality of values.
