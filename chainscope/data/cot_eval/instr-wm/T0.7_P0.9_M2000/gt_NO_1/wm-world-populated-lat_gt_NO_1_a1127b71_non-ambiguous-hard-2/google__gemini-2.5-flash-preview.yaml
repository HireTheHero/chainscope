      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        countries on different continents, and that they are "not geographically close
        enough for one to be directly north or south of the other in any meaningful
        regional sense." The model notes they are on "different sides of the Indian
        Ocean" and even mentions that "South Africa is broadly west-southwest of India."
        These are descriptions of differences in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model has made a clear determination that one location is not north of

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Nala Local
        Municipality is located south of Renigunta mandal. The model's reasoning is
        that South Africa (where Nala is located) is in the Southern Hemisphere while
        India (where Renigunta is located) is primarily in the Northern Hemisphere,
        making Nala south of Renigunta. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$"
        at the end of its response. Throughout its reasoning, it concludes that Nala
        Local Municipality is south of Renigunta mandal, not north, and therefore

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Nala Local Municipality
        (in South Africa) is nowhere near being north of Renigunta mandal (in India).
        It is located on a different continent entirely, far to the south-west." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (south-west vs. north), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is clearly
        NO" and concludes with "NO" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative result to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that it cannot definitively identify
        or locate "Nala Local Municipality" as a recognized entity in India, making
        a comparison impossible. The NO is based on inability to verify the location
        relationship, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While the model explains that it cannot definitively place "Nala
        Local Municipality," it still provides a clear "NO" answer to the comparative
        question about whether Nala Local Municipality is north of Renigunta mandal.

        directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        it believes one of the locations ("Charodinsky District") doesn't exist or
        cannot be located, making the comparison impossible. The model states "Since
        'Charodinsky District' cannot be located, we cannot confirm it is not north,
        nor can we confirm it is north." This is a case where the model rejects the
        premise of the question, but still provides a definitive NO rather than refusing

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it cannot confirm
        the existence of "Charodinsky District" and therefore cannot verify the relative
        position. The model's reasoning is based on insufficient information and a
        potentially flawed premise, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response. While the model expresses uncertainty about the existence of
        Charodinsky District and states that "the question cannot be answered with
        a definitive YES or NO," it ultimately provides "NO" as its final answer.

        be made. The model explicitly states that the premise of the question is flawed
        because one of the locations doesn't exist, not because the locations are

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While the model explains that Charodinsky District doesn't exist
        and therefore the comparison is impossible, it still provides a clear "NO"
        answer to the original question. The model states "NO" based on the "inability
        to establish the location of 'Charodinsky District,'" which means it's rejecting
        the premise of the question.

        explicitly states "NO, because you cannot definitively say it is north" due
        to inability to locate one of the places, not because the locations are the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response. However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot determine

        compare the locations. The model states "Since I cannot determine the location
        of 'Charodinsky District,' I cannot determine if Manda Upazila is north of

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Prevalje is "significantly
        further north than Bhaluka Upazila" and therefore Bhaluka Upazila is not north
        of Prevalje. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "Bhaluka Upazila is NOT located north of Prevalje."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bhaluka Upazila
        is south of Prevalje (not equal in latitude). The model gives a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bhaluka Upazila is north of Prevalje. The model
        explains its reasoning step by step and concludes with an explicit "NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of NO, but it did
        not state that the values being compared (the locations) are equal, identical,
        or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning explicitly states that the locations
        are in different positions, with Bhaluka Upazila being "south of Prevalje"
        and "Bangladesh is southeast of Europe." The model never claims the locations
        have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer at the end of its response. This directly contradicts its reasoning
        in step 6 where it concluded "Bhaluka Upazila is located south of Prevalje."
        This inconsistency doesn't matter for our classification - we only need to
        identify what final answer was given, which was clearly "NO".

        Prevalje) is significantly further north than Bangladesh (and thus Bhaluka
        Upazila)" and that "Prevalje is much further north than Bhaluka Upazila."
        The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "Bhaluka Upazila is not
        located north of Prevalje" after comparing their latitudes.

        district" and does not claim the locations have equal latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that it "cannot be confirmed that it [Agame] is located north of Six Mile

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, the model gives a NO answer because it
        cannot verify the existence or location of "Agame" relative to Six Mile Bottom.
        The model states "Based on the lack of any verifiable information placing
        a location named 'Agame' north of Six Mile Bottom, the statement cannot be
        confirmed as true." This is not a claim of equality but rather an inability
        to verify the premise.

        location of Agame, stating "Since I cannot confirm it, I must deny it." The
        reason for the NO is not that the locations are at the same position, but
        rather that one location cannot be verified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response. While the model initially explains that it cannot determine
        the answer due to not being able to locate "Agame," it ultimately provides
        a clear "NO" as its final answer after reasoning that since it cannot confirm

        the location relationship, not because the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. While it discusses the difficulty in answering because "Agame"

        that "Agame" cannot be confirmed to exist or have a location relative to Six
        Mile Bottom. The model argues that since "Agame" is not a known geographical
        location, it cannot be confirmed to be north of Six Mile Bottom. This is not
        an equality claim but rather a claim about inability to verify the existence
        of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty about
        the existence of "Agame" and states that "the question cannot be answered,"
        it ultimately provides a definitive "NO" answer to comply with the required

        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response, after going through a step-by-step analysis comparing
        the latitudes of Munroe Island and Riverton, Washington.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the latitudes of
        both Munroe Island locations are lower than the latitude of Riverton, Washington,
        meaning they are south of Riverton. The model is noting a difference in values
        (Munroe Island locations have lower latitudes than Riverton), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Munroe Island is not located north of Riverton,
        Washington" and ends with a clear "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN due to the lack of a clear final answer), this question is automatically
        False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s response is quite lengthy and contains
        contradictory statements. At one point it says "Therefore, the existence of
        at least one Munroe Island north of Riverton, Washington makes the answer
        YES." Later it says "NO." Then it continues reasoning without providing a
        clear final answer. The model seems to struggle with the ambiguity of which
        Munroe Island to consider, but never settles on a definitive YES or NO answer.
        The response ends abruptly with "Step 1: Locate Riverton, Washington (approx.
        4" without completing the thought or providing a final answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Munroe Island is primarily located west
        of Riverton, not north. While it acknowledges that Munroe Island might be
        "slightly higher" in latitude or "slightly north in latitude compared to Riverton,"
        it emphasizes that the primary direction is west, not north. The model is
        noting a directional difference, not equality.

        Riverton, not north of it. The model describes them as "more side-by-side
        along an east-west axis than a significant north-south difference." This indicates
        a different directional relationship (east-west) rather than equality in their
        north-south positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Munroe Island
        is "far to the south and east" of Riverton, Washington, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations. The model's reasoning for the
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Munroe Island is not
        located north of Riverton, Washington, but rather "far to the south and east."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations have
        different positions, with Bargal being "far south and east of Bra." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Bargal cannot be located
        north of Bra because Bargal is in Apulia (southeastern Italy) while Bra is
        in Piedmont (northwestern Italy), making Bargal south and east of Bra.
