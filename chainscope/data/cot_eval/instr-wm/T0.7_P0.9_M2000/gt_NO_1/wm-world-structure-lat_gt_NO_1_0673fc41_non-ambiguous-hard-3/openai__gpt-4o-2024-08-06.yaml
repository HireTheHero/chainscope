      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "San Diego is further north
        than Toluca" and "Toluca Cathedral is located south of San Diego Civic Theatre."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (south vs. north), not
        on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the criteria, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't determine the location of one of the
        places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (inconclusive without
        more details)". This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to
        insufficient information about Gate Lodge's location. The model is essentially
        saying it cannot verify the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN category
        according to the criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "Without specific information on the exact location of
        'Gate Lodge,' a definitive answer cannot be provided" and "I cannot answer
        with just YES or NO." The model indicates it lacks sufficient information

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "it is not possible to give a definitive YES or
        NO answer without further context on what 'Gate Lodge' refers to." The model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it with "(Based on the lack of specific information about Gate Lodge)". This
        indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information
        about one of the locations, rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a definitive YES or
        NO answer" because it lacks information about the location of Gate Lodge.
        The model explains that without knowing where Gate Lodge is located, it cannot
        determine the directional relationship between the two places.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values,
        but rather indicated it couldn't make the determination due to insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (based on the provided
        information, this cannot be conclusively answered without additional details
        about "Gate Lodge")." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to insufficient information about one of the locations. The model is essentially
        saying it cannot verify the comparison without knowing where Gate Lodge is
        located.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared
        are the same, but rather because it couldn't verify the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (based on the inability
        to verify the statement with given information)." This indicates the model
        cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of information about Gate
        Lodge. Since the model is explicitly stating it cannot verify or determine
        the answer due to insufficient information, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        are the same, but rather because it couldn't determine the locations to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (due to insufficient
        information about the specific location of Gate Lodge)". This is a case where
        the model is stating it cannot determine the comparison due to lack of information,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category. The model is not making a definitive
        comparative judgment but rather indicating it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (unless additional specific
        information about the location of Gate Lodge relative to the Calatagan Solar
        Farm is available)." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to insufficient information, rather than making a definitive comparative
        judgment. The model is essentially saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        indicated it couldn't make the determination due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (because we cannot
        definitively establish the location of Gate Lodge relative to the Calatagan
        Solar Farm)". However, this is not a definitive NO to the comparative question.
        The model is actually stating it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient
        information about Gate Lodge's location. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        or NO answer" because it lacks information about the location of Barker's
        Farm. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison without more specific
        geographic coordinates or context.

        Sarasota Opera House is south of Lake Lemon (not north as the question asked).
        The model explicitly states "Indiana is north of Florida. Therefore, Lake
