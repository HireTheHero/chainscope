      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that NTPC Ramagundam is south
        of Arfa Software Technology Park, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that NTPC Ramagundam
        is south of Arfa Software Technology Park, which is the opposite of north.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality of the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in step 5 of its reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end. The
        model is directly answering the comparative question about whether NTPC Ramagundam
        is north of Arfa Software Technology Park.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        for its NO answer, stating that "Telangana (where NTPC Ramagundam is) is south
        of Pakistan (where Arfa Software Technology Park is located)." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        is in Hong Kong (East Asia) and Bratsk Reservoir is in Siberia (Russia), and
        specifically states "Geographically, Hong Kong is south of Siberia." The NO
        answer is based on directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.

        (the latitudes) are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Hong Kong
        is in southeastern China and is south of Russia, where Bratsk Reservoir is
        located. The NO answer is based on directional difference (Hong Kong being
        south of Russia), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, indicating that Sai Ying Pun Community Complex is NOT north

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Bratsk Reservoir is in northern Russia while Sai Ying Pun Community Complex
        is in southern China, indicating a difference in positions (with the Community
        Complex being south of the reservoir, not north). The model is noting a directional

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, it clarifies that it's saying NO because it doesn't have enough information
        to confirm a YES, not because it knows the statement is false. This indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, which meets
        the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused to answer due to lack of
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know. I cannot
        confidently say YES or NO." This indicates the model is refusing to provide
        a definitive comparative answer because it lacks the necessary information
        about the locations.

        the comparison ("I do not actually know the precise geographical location"
        and "I cannot definitively determine their relative north/south positioning").
        The NO answer is given because the model doesn't have enough information to
        say YES, not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, making a clear final determination. While the model
        expresses uncertainty and indicates it lacks information, it ultimately provides

        However, the explanation that follows indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information ("I cannot confirm the north-south relationship").

        International Conference Hall is located in Colombo, Sri Lanka (south of India)
        while the Ramganga Dam is in northern India. The model concludes that the
        hall is NOT north of the dam based on their different geographical positions,

        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is south of the other, not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Skaill House is
        north of Sacred Heart Church, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model's NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Sacred Heart Church is north of Skaill House. The
        model explains that Skaill House is north of Sacred Heart Church, not the
        other way around, and concludes with a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confidently
        say it is north of the church)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information. This is a case where the model is saying "NO,
        I cannot verify/determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according
        to the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its reasoning that
        Casa de Segunda is likely in a Spanish-speaking country which would be in
        a different hemisphere or continent from North Korea, and therefore would
        "very likely be south of" the Church of the Life-Giving Trinity. The model
        is making a directional claim (south vs. north), not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Casa de Segunda is NOT located north of the

        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same - rather it
        stated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it immediately qualifies this by saying it's based on "insufficient information"
        and "could potentially be incorrect." The model clearly indicates it "cannot
        answer the question with certainty" and "cannot definitively determine" the
        comparison. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive

        it lacks the specific geographical data required to determine the relative
        positions of the two locations. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and concludes that it does not have enough information
        to determine whether Casa de Segunda is north or south of the Church of the
        Life-Giving Trinity in Pyongyang. This indicates the model cannot make the

        that when it cannot definitively answer, it says NO. This indicates the model
        is saying NO because it lacks information to make the comparison, not as a

        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
