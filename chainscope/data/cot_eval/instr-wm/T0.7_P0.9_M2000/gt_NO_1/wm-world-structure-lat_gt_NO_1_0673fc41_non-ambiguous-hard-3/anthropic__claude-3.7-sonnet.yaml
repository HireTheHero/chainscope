        de Cisneros is south of Wanstead Park station, not north of it. The model
        explicitly states "Since Casa de Cisneros is south of Wanstead Park station
        (not north), the answer is no." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Casa de Cisneros is

        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is south of the other, not
        that they have equal positions.

        that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the South Gippsland
        Freeway is not located north of Inner City Bypass, Brisbane. It is located
        south of it." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        for its NO answer, stating that Victoria (where South Gippsland Freeway is)
        is south of Queensland (where Inner City Bypass is). The model's reasoning
        is based on a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Toluca Cathedral is south of
        San Diego Civic Theatre, indicating a difference in their locations. The model
        gives the reason for the NO answer as Toluca being south of San Diego, not
        that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Toluca Cathedral
        is not located north of San Diego Civic Theatre. It is located south of it."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Laoag Cathedral being in northern Luzon and Jimenez Church
        being in Mindanao, making Jimenez Church south of Laoag Cathedral. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Jimenez Church is located north of Laoag Cathedral.
        The model concludes that "Jimenez Church is located south of Laoag Cathedral,
        not north."

        for the NO answer is based on this directional difference (Jimenez being south
        of Laoag), not on equality of values.

        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Basilica of Saints

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different - Mirani Dam is in southwestern Pakistan while Khanpur Dam is in
        northern Pakistan. The model concludes that Mirani Dam must be south of Khanpur
        Dam, not north of it, which is why it answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mirani Dam is north of Khanpur Dam. The model explicitly

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        southwestern Pakistan while Khanpur Dam is in northern Pakistan, indicating
        a clear difference in their locations (Mirani Dam is south of Khanpur Dam,
        not north). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Dam is south of Khanpur Dam, not north of it." The model identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        being in different locations with Mirani being south, not on them being in
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Dam is in the north. The model concludes that "Mirani Dam is south of Khanpur
        Dam, not north of it," indicating a directional difference rather than equality.

        south of Khanpur Dam, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Mirani Dam is south
