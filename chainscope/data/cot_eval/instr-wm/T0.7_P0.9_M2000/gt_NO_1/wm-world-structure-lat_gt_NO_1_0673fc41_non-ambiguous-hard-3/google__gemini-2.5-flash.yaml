        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "the South Gippsland
        Freeway, being in Victoria, is significantly south of the Inner City Bypass
        in Brisbane." The model is noting a difference in location (one is significantly
        south of the other), not equality.

        difference between the two locations. The model notes they are "in different
        states and are separated by approximately 1,600 kilometers." This difference
        in location is the reason for the NO answer.

        is in Queensland, and Queensland is north of Victoria. The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.

        difference. The reason for the NO answer is that one is south of the other,
        not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the South Gippsland Freeway is located north of the Inner City

        south of the Nebraska/South Dakota border." The model is indicating a clear
        directional difference (south), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        the locations have different relative positions - specifically that Jim Chapman
        Lake is south of Lewis and Clark Lake (not north). The model identified a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that Jim Chapman
        Lake is south of Lewis and Clark Lake, not north, and concluded with a definitive
        "NO" at the end of its response.

        further north than Barker Meadow Reservoir" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Barker Meadow Reservoir is not located
        north of Capilano Lake. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        Meadow Reservoir (the opposite of what was asked). The model gives a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states multiple times that it cannot

        This is rejecting the premise of the question because one of the reference

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is given because the model claims it cannot verify the premise
        since it believes "Lake Lemon" doesn't exist as a widely recognized geographic
