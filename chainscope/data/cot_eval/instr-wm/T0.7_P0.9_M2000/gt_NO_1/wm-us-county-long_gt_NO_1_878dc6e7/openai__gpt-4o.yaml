      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Ward County is "west of
        Haakon County," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Ward County,
        ND is not located east of Haakon County, SD."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not relevant
        since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its final conclusion,
        saying "Therefore, the answer is YES, Ward County, ND, is located slightly
        east of Haakon County, SD."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Ward County's longitude is
        generally further west compared to Haakon County," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Ward
        County is "further west" compared to Haakon County, not because they are at
        the same longitude. Since it identifies a directional difference (even if
        factually incorrect), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Ward County is west of Haakon County (not east
        as asked in the question). This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal positions. Rather, the NO was given because Lynchburg
        is described as being south of (not east of) Amherst County - indicating a
        different relative position, not equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it states that Lynchburg is south of
        Amherst County (a directional difference). The NO is based on a different
        relative position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        confirms "Lynchburg City, VA, is not located east of Amherst County, VA."
        This is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states that Lynchburg
        City is directly south of Amherst County, indicating a different position.
        The NO answer was based on directional difference (south instead of east),
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional explanation
        for why Lynchburg City is not east of Amherst County (stating it is directly
        south instead).

        that the locations are at the same longitude or equally positioned east/west.
        Instead, it describes their relative positions as north/south of each other.
        The NO is not based on equal east/west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether Lynchburg City is east of Amherst County. The answer is
        definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lemhi
        County is west of Missoula County, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("located
        to the west of"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Teller County is southwest of Broomfield County, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Teller County is east of Broomfield County. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Teller County
        is "further to the west compared to Broomfield County" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        preceded by "Teller County is not located east of Broomfield County." This
        is an explicit NO comparative answer.

        there is a directional difference, with Hill County being "south and slightly
        west" of Denton County.

        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it indicates that Hill
        County is "south-southeast of Denton County" and gives this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, not because of any equality between their
        positions.

        City is "west of the Northern Virginia counties, including Stafford County."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is "west of Wakulla County" and is "to the northwest of Wakulla County," indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Terrell County is west of Wakulla County. This is a
        direct comparative answer to the question of whether Terrell County is east
        of Wakulla County.

        County is "further east" than New Castle County, and this difference in position
        is the reason for the NO answer. The presence of a directional difference
        (even if factually incorrect) means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether New Castle County, DE is east of Accomack County,
        VA. The answer is given definitively based on geographical comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Archuleta County was described as being "south and slightly east" of Gunnison
        County. The presence of any directional difference (even if described as "slight")
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing a clear directional assessment that Archuleta
        County is not east of Gunnison County (noting it is "south and slightly east").

    9bdfac39-7ab9-4793-923d-7f7f40276538:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference,
        describing Chittenden County as being "north and somewhat east" of Rutland
        County, with the NO answer appearing to be based on the primary direction
        being north rather than east. Any directional difference, even if described
        as "slight," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer regarding whether Chittenden County is east of Rutland
        County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it stated that Chittenden County is
        "slightly east" (along with being primarily north) of Rutland County. Since
        it noted a difference in position, even if described as "slight", this cannot
        be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Chittenden County is east of Rutland County. The answer
        is given definitively after the analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being in the same location - it explicitly states that Chittenden County is
        northwest of Rutland County, indicating a directional difference. The NO is
        based on Chittenden being west (not east) of Rutland.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a specific directional relationship (Chittenden County is northwest
        of Rutland County)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Anne Arundel is "northwest of Calvert County"), not because the counties
        are in the same location. The model explicitly notes a difference in position
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are the same - rather, it stated they have different relative
        positions (Anne Arundel is north of Calvert). The NO was based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Anne Arundel County,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it described a complex
        geographical relationship where parts of Anne Arundel County have different
        positions relative to Calvert County, with some parts being "slightly east"
        and others being "somewhat west." Since the model noted these differences
        rather than equality, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer regarding whether Anne Arundel County is east of Calvert County.
