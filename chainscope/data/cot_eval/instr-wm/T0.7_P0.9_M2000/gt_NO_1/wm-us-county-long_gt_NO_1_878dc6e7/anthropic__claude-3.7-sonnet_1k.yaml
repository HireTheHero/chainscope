      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Manatee County
        is WEST of McCormick County, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model is stating there is a clear difference in longitude
        between the counties, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Manatee County, FL is east of McCormick County, SC. In its step
        4, it explicitly concludes "Manatee County, FL lies WEST of McCormick County,
        SC (not east)" and then gives a final "NO" answer.

        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Manatee County is west of
        McCormick County, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Manatee County is not
        east of McCormick County; it is west of it)" as its final answer. This is

        of Manatee County, FL, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model specifically states "McCormick County, SC has a more easterly longitude
        than Manatee County, FL" which shows they have different values.

        reasoning is that "Even though Manatee County is on Florida's west coast,
        all of Florida is generally west of South Carolina" and "McCormick County,
        being in western South Carolina, is still east of Manatee County." This clearly

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether Manatee County, FL is located east
        of McCormick County, SC. The model clearly concludes that Manatee County is
        not east of McCormick County (it actually determines that Manatee County is

        orientation rather than an east-west orientation." This indicates a relative
        positioning rather than equality. The model is saying NO because of the counties'
        north-south arrangement, not because they are exactly equal in their east-west
        positions.

        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the same longitude or exactly equal in their east-west positioning. Instead,
        it explains that "neither county is east of the other" because "both counties
        border Lake Michigan on their east and their relationship is primarily north-south."
        The model is describing a geographical arrangement where the counties are
        aligned along the same shoreline, but it doesn't explicitly state they have

        "Ozaukee may extend slightly more eastward in some parts due to the shoreline
        curvature" which acknowledges a difference. The model's reasoning for the
        NO answer is that Ozaukee is "more accurately described as being south of
        Sheboygan, not east of it" rather than claiming they have identical east-west
        positions.

        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Wallowa County, OR is located east of Lander County, NV. The model

        a difference in position (even if described as "slightly"), not equality.
        The model is saying NO because Wichita County is west, not east, of Jim Hogg
        County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Wichita County is

        slightly west of Hillsdale County on a map" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the locations of Gratiot County and Hillsdale County.
        The model concludes that "Gratiot County is actually slightly west of Hillsdale
        County on a map" and provides this as the basis for its negative answer.

        County is either at a similar longitude OR slightly west, which indicates
        a potential difference. Even the "similar longitude" is presented as one possibility,
        not as the definitive reason for the NO answer.

        is a difference in position (Terry County is slightly east), which is why
        Garden County is NOT east of Terry County. Since the model notes a difference
        rather than equality, this is not a case where the NO answer is due to equal
        values.

        coordinates, Garden County, NE is located east of Terry County, TX on the
        east-west axis" but then contradicts this with its "NO" answer. The model
        does not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same east-west
        position. The contradiction appears to be an error in reasoning rather than
        a claim of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the question "Is Garden County, NE located

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "They are actually at similar
        longitudes, with Foard County potentially being slightly east of Kidder County."
        While it notes they are at "similar longitudes," it also indicates a directional
        difference (Foard County being "slightly east"), which means they are not
        exactly the same. The model is not saying NO because the values are exactly
        equal, but because Foard County is actually slightly east of Kidder County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Kidder County, ND
        is not located east of Foard County, TX." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

        a difference in position (Archuleta being west rather than east), not equality.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the premise of the question is incorrect
        according to the model's understanding.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        in position (albeit a small one). This contradicts the final NO answer, but
        we're instructed not to resolve contradictions. Since the model notes a difference
        rather than equality, this is not a case where the NO is because the values
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Idaho panhandle is still east of Riverside County, California in terms of
        longitude." This indicates a difference in position, not equality. The NO
        answer is because the comparison is in the opposite direction of what was
        asked (Shoshone is east of Riverside, not Riverside east of Shoshone).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Riverside County is west
        of Shoshone County, indicating a clear directional difference. The model's
        reasoning is that "All of California lies west of Idaho in terms of longitude"
        and "Riverside County, CA is west of Shoshone County, ID, not east of it."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of

        they are "at approximately the same longitude," it actually states "If anything,
        Coos County is slightly west of Clallam County due to the way the coastline
        curves." This indicates a difference in position (Coos being slightly west,
        not equal), which is part of the reasoning for the NO answer.

        aligned on a north-south axis," but this is not claiming they are at identical
        positions. The model is indicating they are similar but not exactly equal,
        and the NO answer is based on Coos County not being east of Clallam County.

        Coos County" and "Coos County is located east of Clallam County." The NO answer
        appears to be contradicting the model's own reasoning rather than indicating
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which contradicts its reasoning in step 6 where it concluded "Coos

        that "Anne Arundel County is actually positioned to the northwest of Calvert
        County, not to its east." The model is indicating a directional difference
        between the counties as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Anne Arundel County
        is not located east of Calvert County, MD" as its final answer. This is an
        explicit NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are in
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Calvert County lies to the east of Anne Arundel County, not the other way
        around." The model is indicating a directional difference between the two
        counties (Calvert is east of Anne Arundel), which is why it answers NO to
        the question of whether Anne Arundel is east of Calvert.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Anne Arundel County, MD located east of Calvert
        County, MD?" The model provides a definitive comparative judgment with a clear
        NO at the end of its response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that McDonald County
        is west of Jackson County, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on McDonald County
        being west of Jackson County, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that McDonald County is not east of Jackson County. The model provides
        a direct comparative answer to the question.

        further west than Jackson County" and later says "McDonald County is west
        (or at best, approximately at the same longitude) of Jackson County." Since
        the model identifies a directional difference (McDonald County being "slightly
        further west"), this is not a case where the NO answer is based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether McDonald County is east of Jackson County. The
