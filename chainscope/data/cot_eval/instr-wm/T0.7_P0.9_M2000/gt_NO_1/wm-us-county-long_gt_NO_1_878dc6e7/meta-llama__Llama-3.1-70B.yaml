      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Rabun County is
        "south and west" compared to Oakland County, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on Rabun County being west of Oakland County, not because
        they are at the same longitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Adams County is "more to
        the north and west" compared to Eddy County, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on Adams County being west (not east) of Eddy County.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it explains
        that Adams County is not east of Eddy County because it is north of it. The
        NO answer is based on directional difference (being north instead of east),
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the counties.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference,
        describing Adams County as being "to the north and east" of Eddy County. The
        NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining that Adams County is "generally to the north and east"
        rather than directly east of Eddy County.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same. Instead, it explains that Adams County is "more eastward" while
        Eddy County is "more to the south" - indicating different positions. The NO
        answer is based on them not being directly east-west of each other, not because
        of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" as a comparative result, indicating Adams County is not directly east
        of Eddy County.'

    f0f14de1-4745-465a-b0a7-23e36cdee174:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude. Instead, it indicates there are differences in position, noting
        that Adams County is "north and possibly slightly east" of Eddy County. The
        NO answer is given because the model determines Adams County is "not significantly
        east" of Eddy County, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when determining if Adams County, CO is east of Eddy County, NM. The answer
        is clearly stated and is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Adams County is
        "north and possibly slightly west of" Eddy County, indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Hunterdon
        County is in the western part of New Jersey while Cape May County is in the
        southeastern corner, and concludes NO because Hunterdon is west of Cape May,
        not because they are equal/same/identical in location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        explains that Hunterdon County is west of Cape May County, not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Hunterdon County is in the western part of NJ while Cape May County is
        in the southeastern corner, and concludes NO because Hunterdon is west of
        Cape May (indicating a difference in location, not equality).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion of its step-by-step analysis and in its
        summary. This NO is given as a direct comparative result (Hunterdon County
        is not east of Cape May County).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly describes
        them as being in different positions (Hunterdon in the west, Cape May in the
        southeast) and bases its NO answer on Hunterdon being "more inland and to
        the west compared to Cape May County's coastal and southeastern location."

        or the same. Instead, it explains that Hunterdon County is in the western
        part of NJ while Cape May County is at the southern tip and more eastward,
        indicating different positions. The NO answer is based on their relative positions
        being different, not on them being equal.

        being "more inland and to the west compared to Cape May County's coastal and
        southeastern location" - it describes a directional difference rather than
        equal positions. The NO is due to Hunterdon being west of Cape May, not because

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it gives a NO answer
        because Hunterdon County is described as being in the western part while Cape
        May County is at the southern tip, indicating different positions.

        with Hunterdon County being "more inland and to the west" while Cape May County
        is "closer to the Atlantic coast and to the east." The NO answer is based

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Ward County is
        "likely west of" Haakon County, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it indicated that Ward
        County is "north and possibly slightly east or directly north" but "not significantly
        east" of Haakon County. This suggests a difference in position, even if slight,
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Ward County is east of Haakon County. This is a clear comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal longitude or that they are the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - that Ward County is north of Haakon County rather than

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it gives a NO answer
        based on their different relative positions (Bullitt in northern KY vs Metcalfe
        in south-central KY). The NO is based on their different positions, not on
        them being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Bullitt
        County is "situated more to the west compared to Metcalfe County" and uses
        this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it indicates that Bullitt
        County is "more to the north and west of Metcalfe County," suggesting a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on Bullitt being west of Metcalfe, not
        on them being at the same longitude.

        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Bullitt
        County is west of Metcalfe County, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer was given because Bullitt is west (not east) of Metcalfe, not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Bullitt County is east of Metcalfe County. The answer

        or the same. Instead, it specifically notes that Chattooga County is "south
        and slightly west of Trimble County." This directional difference, even though
        described as "slightly west," means the locations are not equal, and this
        difference is part of the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        or the same in any way. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Hill County is south of Denton County and therefore cannot be east
        of it. The response describes different positions for each county (central
        vs northern Texas).

        (Hill County being south of Denton County), not because the counties are in
        the same location or have equal coordinates. The model identifies a directional
        difference between the counties' positions, so this is not a case of equal
        values.

        that the locations are at the same longitude or equally east/west of each
        other. Instead, it focuses on their relative positions within Virginia, describing
        them as being in different parts of the state (central vs northern). The NO
        answer is not based on the locations being equal in terms of eastward position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, stating "Richmond City is not located east of Stafford County."

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explains that Richmond City is in central
        Virginia while Stafford County is in northern Virginia, and uses this difference
        in positions to conclude that Richmond is not east of Stafford. The NO is
        based on relative positions being different, not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Presque Isle being west of Livingston), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states that Presque Isle County is west of Livingston
        County, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explains that Presque Isle County is
        more north than east while Livingston County is in the southeastern part,
        indicating different positions. The NO is based on relative positions being
        different, not being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final conclusion
        in step 5, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the counties.

        in fact, it explicitly noted differences in position, stating that Rockwall
        County is "south and slightly west" of Osage County. The NO answer was based
        on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" at the end

        the counties "cannot be significantly east or west of each other" and are
        "roughly on the same east-west line," this is describing approximate equality
        rather than exact equality. The model's language suggests they are close but

        Moines County is "more westward than Sawyer County" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO is because one location is explicitly stated
        to be west of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.

        only applies when the final answer is explicitly NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        in its conclusion. While it states "Des Moines County, IA, is indeed east

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly described
        differences in their positions, stating that Blanco County is in central Texas
        and Caddo County is in southwestern Oklahoma. The NO answer was not based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" at the end
        of its response, which directly answers whether Blanco County, TX is west
        of Caddo County, OK. However, this appears to contradict the reasoning in
        step 5 which states it "is indeed west." Despite this contradiction, we must

        the same location - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions (McDonald County in southwestern corner, Jackson County more centrally
        in western part). The NO answer is based on their different relative positions,
        not because they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or equally positioned. Instead, it explains that McDonald
        County extends further west than Jackson County, which is a difference in
        position. This difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that McDonald
        County is "west and south of Jackson County," indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
