        never reaches a clear final conclusion. While the model works through various
        calculations and considerations, going back and forth between different possibilities,
        it never definitively states a final YES or NO answer. The last complete thought
        suggests "NO" but then starts reconsidering with "Wait, no" before being cut

        positions for the two counties, with one being in the western part and one
        at the southern tip.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Hunterdon is not
        east of Cape May County because it lies northwest of it.

        northeast." The model identified a directional difference, not equality, as
        its reason for saying NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes

        never concluded the counties were at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer about whether Andrew County is east of Platte
        County. It repeatedly considers different possibilities ("maybe", "perhaps",
        "alternatively") and ends with uncertainty, suggesting Andrew could be "north
        and possibly a bit west or east" or "northeast of Platte" without making a
        definitive comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: After extensive reasoning, the model never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO answer about whether Andrew County is east of Platte
        County. The response ends with uncertainty, saying "depending on the exact
        positioning, maybe it's slightly east as well." Throughout the response, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences,
        specifically stating that Hill County is "south and slightly west" of Denton
        County. The model never claims the counties are in the same location or have
        equal coordinates - it explicitly notes directional differences as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a definitive comparative
        directional assessment that Hill County is south and slightly west of Denton
        County, not east.

        nearly the same longitude (~97.1\xB0W)\", this is not given as the reason\
        \ for the NO answer. Instead, the NO is because Hill County is described as\

        \ is used to establish the north-south alignment, but the answer is based\
        \ on directional difference (south vs east), not equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Hill County
        is directly south of Denton County, not east." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        it expresses some uncertainty about the exact positions ("maybe the counties
        are shifted") and concludes that Hill County is "southwest" of Denton County,
        indicating a western component to its position. The NO answer is based on
        Hill County being southwest, not on the locations being at identical longitudes.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It identifies contradictory evidence (county
        seat coordinates suggest George is east, but county positions relative to
        Alabama suggest George is west) and ends without resolving this contradiction
        or making a definitive comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model was comparing different locations rather than stating they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO conclusion
        to the comparison. The response ends mid-thought while still trying to reason
        about the relative positions, without reaching a final determination about
        which county is more east.

        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate
        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and
        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model explores various
        possibilities and even finds that Lucedale (George County) is slightly east
        of De Kalb (Kemper County), it continues analyzing without making a definitive

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a final "NO" answer, explaining that George County is west of Kemper
        County, not east of it. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        statement. While there is extensive reasoning that seems to conclude "NO"
        multiple times in the thinking process, the actual response ends with "To
        determine if Pemiscot County, MO, is east of Peoria County, IL:" without completing
        the answer. Therefore, we cannot determine the model's final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a definitive comparative result explaining that
        Ozaukee County is south of Sheboygan County, not east of it.

    97fdab8b-f219-4f41-ab98-c74cb2f48255:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location or have equal positions. Instead, the
        model explicitly states that Ozaukee is south of Sheboygan (indicating different
        positions). The NO answer was given because Ozaukee is described as being
        in a different direction (south) rather than east of Sheboygan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive conclusion that Ozaukee is south of Sheboygan,
        not east. The answer is presented in bold and is unambiguous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or equally east. Instead, it explains that Ozaukee is south
        of Sheboygan, with both counties being along Lake Michigan. While they are
        described as being along the same shoreline, the NO answer is given because
        of their north-south relationship, not because they are equally east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including in its final formal answer, concluding that Ozaukee County
        is south of (not east of) Sheboygan County.

        align with the lake" and "their east-west position is the same," this is not
        given as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model emphasizes
        that Ozaukee is south of Sheboygan as the main reason for saying NO. The alignment
        of boundaries is mentioned as supporting context but not as the primary justification
        for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation that Ozaukee is south of Sheboygan,
        not east. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that both counties are "along
        the eastern edge" and have "same longitude roughly," this is not presented
        as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model emphasizes that
        their relationship is primarily north-south ("their primary alignment relative
        to each other is north-south rather than east-west") and that Ozaukee is south
        of Sheboygan. The "roughly" same longitude indicates there might be slight
        differences, so they're not explicitly stated to be exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        in its final explanation, clearly indicating that Ozaukee County is not east
        of Sheboygan County.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        eastern boundary (the lake)" and are "aligned north-south," indicating that
        their eastern positions are equal/identical, and this equality is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer. The model explicitly uses this sameness in
        eastern position to conclude that Ozaukee is not east of Sheboygan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer explaining that Ozaukee is not east of Sheboygan County.

        east-west position is the same" and uses this equality to conclude that Ozaukee
        is not east of Sheboygan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        counties are in different locations, with Moore being west of Scotland County.
        It does not state they are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes
        their different positions (Moore in central Piedmont, Scotland in southeastern
        part). The NO is because Moore is west of Scotland, not because they're in
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that Moore County is west

        explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Moore County being
        "west" and "northwest" of Scotland County. Even though this might be a small
        difference, any stated directional difference means we must classify this
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Moore being west of Scotland, not on them being in the same location.

        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" multiple
        times, both after its thinking process and in its final answer section. The
        model was confident in stating that Schuylkill County is east of Tyrrell County
        based on its longitude comparison.

        The model did discuss various equal measurements at points but never reached
        a NO conclusion based on them.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering different
        possibilities and alternatives until the end, expressing uncertainty and presenting
        conflicting scenarios without settling on a final answer.

        between their locations. The NO was based on McDonald being in a different
        direction (southwest) than what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion that McDonald County is southwest of Jackson

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends abruptly
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model seems to lean
        towards YES at several points ("So yes, El Dorado is east of San Luis Obispo"),
        it continues to question and contradict this conclusion throughout, ultimately
        ending in confusion without a final determination.

        criteria only applies when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it concludes with some reasoning suggesting
        El Dorado is east of SLO ("So El Dorado is east of SLO"), it doesn't explicitly
        state this as a final answer, and appears to still want to "confirm this with
        actual longitudes." The response ends without making a definitive comparative
        statement.

        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends abruptly
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model seems to lean
        towards YES at one point ("Therefore, the answer should be YES"), it immediately
        doubles back to express doubt about coordinates and ends without resolving
        the contradiction or stating a final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and
        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model does extensive analysis
        comparing longitudes and positions, it gets caught in circular reasoning and
        keeps second-guessing its calculations without ever stating a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" followed by a clear
        explanation affirming that El Dorado County is east of San Luis Obispo County.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were
        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps questioning its own logic, goes
        back and forth on coordinates, and ends mid-thought without providing a final
        answer. This is a clear case where no definitive answer was given.

      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought and never provides a
        clear YES/NO conclusion about whether El Dorado County is east of San Luis
