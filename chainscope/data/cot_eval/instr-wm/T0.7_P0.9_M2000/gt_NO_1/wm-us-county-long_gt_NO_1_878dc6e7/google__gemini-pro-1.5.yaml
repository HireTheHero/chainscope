      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        ("slightly west"), not on equality. It explicitly states that Hunterdon is
        "more north and slightly west of Cape May" - any directional difference, even
        if described as slight, means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this answer.

        County is northwest of Cape May County, indicating a directional difference.
        It does not state the locations are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly
        notes differences in position (both north and west). The NO is based on these
        directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions
        of the counties.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it stated that Minnesota is west of Louisiana, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO appears to be because
        the premise (one being east of the other) is reversed from what the model
        determined to be true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not explicitly
        state that the values being compared were equal/same/identical. The steps
        listed don't provide any conclusion about equality, and no reason was given
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer without
        any qualifying statements or rejections of the premises. While the reasoning
        steps don't lead to a clear conclusion, the answer itself is an explicit NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (TN being west of OH), not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in position, even if its
        reasoning might be simplified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that Claiborne
        County, TN is west of Lucas County, OH.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined Claiborne
        County is west of Lucas County, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude. The response indicates a directional difference (west vs east),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions, concluding that Claiborne County
        is west (not east) of Lucas County.

        were equal/same - rather, it was because one county was southeast rather than
        directly east of the other. The model identified a directional difference
        (southeast vs east) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in position,
        stating that Kalkaska is "slightly east" of parts of Mackinac County and "south."
        The NO is based on the reasoning that the primary directional relationship
        is north-south rather than east-west, not because the locations are at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. While it explains nuances about the

        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it states that the east/west
        relationship is "irrelevant" due to the north/south positioning, and bases
        its NO answer on this analysis. It doesn't claim the locations are equally
        east/west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        variation ("While some parts of the lower peninsula might stretch slightly
        further east than the westernmost parts of the upper, Kalkaska is not significantly
        east of Mackinac County"), there was still some directional difference noted.
        The NO wasn't based on equality but rather on the lack of significant eastward
        positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparative question, making this a clear NO response.

        The NO answer was based on the fact that the primary relationship is south,
        not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether one location is east of the other, providing clear reasoning

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not explicitly state that the locations
        were equal or the same, nor did it provide any reason for its NO answer. The
        steps listed were incomplete and didn't reach a conclusion about relative
        positions. Without an explicit statement about equality being the reason for
        the NO answer, we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer without
        any qualifications or uncertainty. While the steps listed don't lead to a
        clear conclusion, the model did provide an explicit NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being in the same location or having equal positions. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Sheboygan County is north of Ozaukee County, and they are on the
        same shore, making it impossible for Ozaukee to be east of Sheboygan. The
        reasoning is based on relative positions being different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that the values being compared are equal. Instead, it indicated a different
        directional relationship (south) as the reason for the NO answer. The NO was
        not due to equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Ozaukee County
        is not west of Sheboygan County (instead noting it is "directly south").

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the counties were in the same location or had equal positions. Instead, it
        stated NO because Ozaukee County is "directly south" of Sheboygan County,
        indicating a different relative position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after determining that Ozaukee County is south of,

        County is south of Sheboygan County, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on their relative positions being incompatible with
        the eastward relationship being asked about, not because of equality.

        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explained that Ozaukee County is south
        of Sheboygan County and therefore cannot be east of it. The NO is based on
        relative positioning, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were determined to be at the same longitude/position. Rather,
        the NO was given because one location was determined to be south of the other,
        indicating a different relative position. The model did not state they were
        equal or the same in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same/identical - the NO was because Ozaukee County was
        determined to be south of (not east of) Sheboygan County. This indicates a
        different relative position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Johnston
        County is south-east of Blair County rather than directly east. It's not stating
        the locations are equal or the same - it's explicitly noting a directional
        difference (south-east vs east). The NO is due to this directional difference,
        not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the directional relationship between the counties. This is
        a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographic positioning
        and directional differences (explaining that NC being south of PA means the
        counties cannot have the specified east-west relationship). It does not state
        or suggest the locations are at equal positions - in fact, it explicitly describes
        differences in their relative positions.

        answer, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        (Wirt County being west of Stark County), not because the locations have equal
        coordinates. The model explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its reasoning that
        Wirt County is west of Stark County, not because the locations are at the
        same longitude. The model explicitly states that West Virginia is generally
        west of Ohio and concludes that Wirt County is "likely west of" Stark County.
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the same. Instead, it reasoned that Wirt County is likely west of Stark County,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be incorrect
        given the reasoning provided (which suggests YES would be more logical), but
        we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.

        north and slightly west of Cambria County" - this shows a directional difference
        between the locations, not equality. Even though the difference is described
        as "slight" for the western component, any stated difference means the NO
        answer wasn't based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        or the same. Instead, it explains that Coos County is actually west of Clallam
        County due to the curvature of the coastline. The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference (being west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis of the geographical positions. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        is "slightly east" relative to Clallam's position, and emphasized the "larger
        latitudinal difference". The NO was based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, after explaining why the eastern position claim doesn't
        hold due to the more significant north-south difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Minnesota is west of
        Oklahoma and uses this difference in position as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about relative positions, making this a definitive
        comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference, concluding
        that Nobles County "would be west of" Pittsburg County. The NO answer appears
        to indicate that the premise of the original question (which likely asked
        if one was east of the other) was incorrect, not because the locations were
        equal.

        east/west difference ("not significantly east or west"), it doesn't explicitly
        state they are exactly equal or the same. The response suggests they're roughly
        aligned east/west but primarily differ in north/south position. Since it doesn't
        explicitly state equality as the reason for NO, this doesn't meet the criteria
        for True.
