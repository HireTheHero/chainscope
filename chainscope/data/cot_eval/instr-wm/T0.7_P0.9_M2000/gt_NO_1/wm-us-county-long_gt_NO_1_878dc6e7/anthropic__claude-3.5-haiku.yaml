        (stating Adams County is west of Eddy County, not east), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, so this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that "Adams County is west of Eddy County." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Adams County is
        east of Eddy County's longitude, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO appears to be an error given the model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate
        based on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that Hunterdon County
        is west of Cape May County and Cape May County is east of Hunterdon County,
        indicating different positions. The NO was based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the counties (stating Hunterdon is west, not east, of Cape May)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        it describes (Hunterdon being west of Cape May, and Cape May being east of
        Hunterdon). It does not state that the locations are equal or the same - in
        fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different positions. The NO
        is because of their relative positions, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Hunterdon County is east of Cape May County. This
        is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

        that Ward County is west of Haakon County, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship (is Ward County east of Haakon County). The model states that
        Ward County is west of Haakon County, leading to its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference (Ward County is "north and west" of Haakon County),
        making this a clear case of different values being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        that Ward County is "north and west" of Haakon County and therefore "NOT east".

        County is west of Broomfield County, not because the counties are at the same
        location. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Teller
        County is west of Broomfield County"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that Teller County is west of Broomfield County and
        therefore NOT east of it. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Sutton County
        is located west of Coke County"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on relative geographic positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical - rather, it stated NO because Wichita
        County is north of Jim Hogg County. The model identified a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (north vs south) for why one location is not east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it explains
        that one is north of the other and explicitly states they have different relative
        positions. The NO answer is based on their different geographical positions,
        not on them being equally east/west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Wichita County is NOT east of Jim
        Hogg County. The answer is explicit and definitive.

        "slightly north" of Lea County, suggesting they are not exactly identical
        in position. The NO answer appears to be based on the general comparative
        assessment rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, making this a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        in position ("Slope County is slightly further west than Lea County") and
        does not claim the locations are equal. The NO answer is based on finding
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        being in the same location or having equal positions. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Gratiot County is west of Hillsdale County, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question about whether Gratiot County
        is east of Hillsdale County. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Coos County is "southwest of Clallam County" and explains that this contradicts
        the premise of being "east". The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the two counties.
        This is a direct comparative answer to whether one location is east of the
        other.
