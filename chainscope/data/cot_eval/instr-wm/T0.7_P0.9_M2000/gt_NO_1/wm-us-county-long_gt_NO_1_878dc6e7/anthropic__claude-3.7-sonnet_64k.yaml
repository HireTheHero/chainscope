        is that Hunterdon County is in western New Jersey while Cape May County is
        in eastern New Jersey, indicating a clear directional difference rather than

        is west of Missoula County, indicating a directional difference. The model
        states "Lemhi County is west of Missoula County, not east of it" and "The
        only possible arrangement is that Lemhi County is west of Missoula County,
        not east of it."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lemhi County is
        west of Missoula County, not east. The model gives a directional difference
        (west vs. east) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Lemhi County would be to the west of Missoula County,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, the model explains that Lemhi County is west of Missoula County
        (not east of it) because Idaho is west of Montana. The model is comparing
        different geographical positions, not stating that the counties are in the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lemhi County is west of Missoula
        County because Idaho is west of Montana. The model specifically states "the
        longitude of Lemhi County (being in Idaho) is lower than the longitude of
        Missoula County (being in Montana)," indicating a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lemhi County, ID is
        not located east of Missoula County, MT" as its final answer. The model provides
        a direct and explicit NO response to the question of whether Lemhi County
        is east of Missoula County.

        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on any equality between the counties' positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lemhi County is
        located west of Missoula County, not east. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality. The reason for the NO answer is
        that the directional relationship is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end

        County, not that they are in the same location. The model clearly indicates
        a directional difference (west vs. east) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly concludes "Lemhi County, ID is not located east of Missoula

        equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Lemhi County
        is west of Missoula County, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model states "Lemhi County must be west of Missoula County"
        and "It is located to the west," clearly indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly concludes "Lemhi County, ID is NOT located east of Missoula

        state that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model
        explains that Lemhi County is west of Missoula County (not east), indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
        of whether Lemhi County, ID is located east of Missoula County, MT with a

        equal or the same. Instead, the model states that Lemhi County is west of
        Missoula County, indicating a directional difference. The model explains that
        Idaho is west of Montana, and therefore Lemhi County (in Idaho) must be west
        of Missoula County (in Montana).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lemhi County, ID is

        way around" and "Bullitt County is more western than Metcalfe County, not

        The model gives a NO answer because of this directional difference, not because
        the counties are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "Bullitt County is NOT located east of Metcalfe

        says "Bullitt County, KY is NOT located east of Metcalfe County, KY. It is

        border Kansas on their western edges, but it doesn't claim they are identical
        or equal in position - rather it explains their relative positioning (north/south)
        as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on
        the counties having approximately the same longitude, with Chattooga County
        possibly being slightly west of Trimble County. The model states "Chattooga
        County's position puts it at roughly the same longitude as Trimble County,
        or slightly to the west." This indicates the model believes they are at similar
        longitudes, not that they are exactly equal. The model does not explicitly
        state that the values are exactly/approximately equal as the primary reason
        for the NO answer.

        to the question "Is Chattooga County, GA located east of Trimble County, KY?"

        The model concludes that "Caribou County must be west of Broadwater County,

        positions. Instead, it explains that "They are primarily arranged in a north-south
        relationship" and "Neither county is significantly further east than the other."

        being north of Rutland. The model states "They are stacked north-south, rather
        than having an east-west relationship." This indicates a difference in positioning,
        not equality.

        and "on a west-to-east axis, the counties are roughly aligned," this indicates
        similarity but not exact equality. The primary reason given for the NO answer
        is that "Chittenden County is primarily north of Rutland County, and not positioned

        County is not located east of Rutland County. It is located north of Rutland

        "parts of Calvert County might extend slightly further east than Anne Arundel
        due to the curvature of the bay's western shoreline." This indicates a difference
        in positioning, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, the question
        about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear and direct answer in the
        final paragraph, stating "Therefore, YES, Faribault County, Minnesota is located
        east of Caddo Parish, Louisiana." The model has made a definitive comparative
        judgment with a clear YES answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are equal\
        \ or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude values\
        \ (93.96\xB0 W vs 93.88\xB0 W) and states that Faribault County is \"slightly\
        \ west\" of Caddo Parish. The model's NO answer is based on this directional\
        \ difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Faribault County, MN
        is not located east of Caddo Parish, LA. It is located slightly west of it."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        \ are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Caddo Parish is\
        \ east of Faribault County, noting a difference in their longitudes (94.1\xB0\
        W vs 93.8\xB0W). The model states \"Caddo Parish, LA is located slightly east\
        \ of Faribault County, MN\" which indicates a directional difference, not\
        \ equality."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Faribault County, MN is located east of Caddo Parish, LA. The answer
