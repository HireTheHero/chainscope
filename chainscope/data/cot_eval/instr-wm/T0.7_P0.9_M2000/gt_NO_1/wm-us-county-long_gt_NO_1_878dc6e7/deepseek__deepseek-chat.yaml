        being in the same position - rather, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions (Yavapai is north of Maricopa). The NO is because Yavapai is north
        instead of east, not because they occupy the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations are in the same position. The model explicitly states that Ballard
        County is northwest of Hardeman County, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Prince
        George's County is "further east" than Schuyler County and that Schuyler County
        is "further west." This indicates a difference in position, not equality,
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        that Clermont County is south of Shiawassee County, not because they are at
        the same longitude. The model does not state or suggest the counties are at
        equal longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Clermont
        County, OH is not located east of Shiawassee County, MI" as its final conclusion.
        This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific longitude values, it
        explicitly states that Clermont County has a "slightly more negative longitude"
        and is "slightly farther west than Shiawassee County." Since it identifies
        a difference in position (even though small), this is not a case of equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it explains they are along
        "the same vertical axis" but the NO answer is given because one is south of
        the other, not because they are equally east/west. The model's reasoning is
        about relative north/south position, not equality of east/west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Ozaukee County is east of Sheboygan County.

      result: 'NO'
    a51572df-c3ca-4c17-82a3-317c498deb44:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west of each other. Instead, it gives a
        different reason for the NO answer - that Ozaukee County is south of Sheboygan
        County rather than east of it. The relative positions are described as different
        (one being south of the other), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a direct comparative
        answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ab9d72aa-5cf1-46ab-be5c-fc7c71db8144:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it explains that they are
        along the same shoreline but emphasizes their north/south relationship, with
        Ozaukee being south of Sheboygan. The NO answer is based on their relative
        positions, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the eastern position of the counties. The answer is clear and
        direct.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it stated that Ozaukee County
        is south of Sheboygan County, indicating a different relative position. The
        NO answer was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result stating that Ozaukee County is not
        east of Sheboygan County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both counties are aligned
        along Lake Michigan's shore, it does not state they are at the same longitude
        or explicitly equal in their east-west position. Instead, it explains the
        NO answer is because they have a north-south relationship, not because they
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative response to whether Ozaukee County
        is east of Sheboygan County.

    f2fa70c1-4efa-4b93-baab-59cbf1efc641:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "their east-west positions
        are roughly similar," this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        the model states NO because Ozaukee County is south of Sheboygan County, not
        east of it. The similarity in east-west position is mentioned but is not presented
        as the primary reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Ozaukee County is not east of Sheboygan
        County."

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Moore
        County is west of Scotland County, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked
        (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Moore County is west of Scotland County, not east of
        it. This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        followed by a clear affirmation that Coos County, OR is located east of Clallam
        County, WA.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it stated that Coos County
        is "south" of Clallam County, indicating a different relative position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the same longitudinal line," this is not given as the primary reason for the
        NO answer. The model describes their positions relative to each other without
        explicitly stating they are equal/identical, and the "roughly aligned" statement
        suggests approximate rather than exact equality.

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Dunklin County is west of the Mississippi River while Mississippi County
        is east of it, indicating a clear directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, with no caveats about inability
        to determine or verify. The answer is presented as a definitive comparison
        based on the relative positions it analyzed.

        difference (Dunklin County being southwest of Mississippi County), not because
        the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Dunklin County,
        MO, is slightly west of Mississippi County, AR" - indicating a difference
        in position, even if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question of whether Dunklin County, MO
        is east of Mississippi County, AR. The answer is definitive and explicitly
        states the directional relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Lafourche Parish is southwest of Tangipahoa Parish, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.

        Lafourche Parish is southwest of Tangipahoa Parish, indicating a clear directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        slightly west of Tangipahoa Parish" and gives this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. It does not indicate the parishes are at
        the same location or equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Lafourche Parish is west of Tangipahoa Parish,
        providing a direct comparative result.

    8920c596-ea31-4496-9452-c30413fc9de8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the parishes are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Lafourche
        Parish is "west of Tangipahoa Parish" and describes them as being in different
        positions, with one being "south and slightly west" of the other. The NO is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Lafourche Parish is west of (not
        east of) Tangipahoa Parish.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the parishes are at
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Lafourche Parish is "southwest" of Tangipahoa Parish, indicating a clear directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Lafourche Parish is not east of Tangipahoa Parish.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

        same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Lafourche Parish is southwest of Tangipahoa Parish, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Lafourche Parish is not east of Tangipahoa
        Parish." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the parishes are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Lafourche
        Parish is "southwest" compared to Tangipahoa Parish, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about relative positions
        (Lafourche being southwest of Tangipahoa, therefore not east of it).

        County is west of Jackson County, not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("McDonald County
        is actually west of Jackson County"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the geographical positions of the two counties, determining
        that McDonald County is west of Jackson County rather than east as asked in
        the question.
