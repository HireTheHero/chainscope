        a rough alignment rather than exact equality, and suggests there may be some
        minor difference in position, just not a significant one. Since the model

        with Ozaukee County being directly south of Sheboygan County. The reason for
        the NO answer is not that they have the same east-west position, but rather
        that their relationship is described as north-south rather than east-west.

        same general east-west positioning along Lake Michigan" but then explains
        that Ozaukee County is "directly south and not farther east than Sheboygan
        County." This indicates a directional relationship (south) rather than equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Moore County is generally
        north of Scotland County, but slightly to the east." The model gives NO as
        an answer because it determines that Moore County is primarily north (not
        east) of Scotland County, despite being "slightly to the east." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in Step 4, where it concludes that Moore County is not located east of Scotland
        County. The answer is clearly stated as "NO" in bold.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer - specifically that "Moore County is positioned north of
        Scotland County, not east." The model is rejecting one directional relationship
        (east) in favor of another (north), not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the correct answer is
        NO" in its final answer section. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparison being asked.

        east." The model acknowledges some eastward positioning ("slightly east")
        but determines this isn't sufficient to answer YES to the question. Since
        the model notes a difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        Step 4 of its reasoning. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question of whether Moore County is east of Scotland County.
