      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Michigan (where Oakland County is) is east of Georgia (where
        Rabun County is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it states that Adams County is "slightly
        west" of Eddy County. Any difference in position, even if described as "slight,"
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Adams County would be "west of" Eddy County. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in the conclusion, making a definitive comparative judgment about
        the relative positions of the two counties.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2569d6fa-1b14-479b-960d-91ec470049d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Adams County is
        "not as far east as Eddy County, NM" and explains their relative positions.
        The NO answer is based on a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Adams County, CO is east of Eddy County, NM. This
        is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this when the answer is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values criteria
        only need to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Adams County is north of Eddy
        County, indicating a different relative position rather than equality
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is extremely long and becomes increasingly
        incoherent, especially in the latter half. While it discusses various geographical
        aspects of both counties and mentions "NO" several times within the rambling
        text, it never provides a clear, definitive YES/NO answer to the original
        question. The response gets lost in considerations and comparisons without
        reaching a conclusive answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    cd107cf8-178b-46cc-81aa-af5dde53aceb:

    d907ee87-0de8-43fc-853c-052c0dce8fd7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer despite some
        nuanced discussion beforehand.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hunterdon County is in the
        western part while Cape May County is in the southeastern part, indicating
        a clear directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparative question
        directly.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states they
        are in different positions, with Hunterdon County being more inland/western
        and Cape May County being on the eastern coast. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis comparing

    22fcaf8d-2ac3-4df8-81ae-73c41cb13e65:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it explicitly describes them as being
        in different positions, with Hunterdon County being "in the western part"
        and Cape May County being "at the southern tip" and "one of the easternmost
        parts." The NO answer is based on their different positions, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        after analyzing the geographical positions of the two counties. This is an

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different positions
        (Hunterdon in the west, Cape May on the eastern coast) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Hunterdon County is east of Cape May County. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Hunterdon County
        is "in the western part" while Cape May County is "coastal and southeastern,"
        indicating different locations. The NO is based on Hunterdon being west of
        Cape May, not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        between their locations. The NO answer was based on Teller being southwest
        rather than east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, determining
        that Teller County is southwest of Broomfield County.

        The NO answer appears to be based on the fact that the primary directional
        relationship is south rather than east, not because the locations are at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it describes them as having
        different relative positions, with Hill County being "more southward" and
        Denton County being "north and slightly east." The NO answer is based on these
        positional differences, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer but not because the
        locations are equal/same - it actually states that Hill County is "south or
        southeast of Denton County." This indicates a difference in position, not
        equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that Hill County is south/southeast of Denton County
        rather than east of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        ("George County is directly south of Kemper County, not east or west of it"),
        not on the locations being equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (south vs. north), so this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        "similar longitudes" and are "roughly at the same longitude," it also notes
        that Claiborne County is "slightly southeast" and there is a "minimal difference."
        Since it acknowledges even a slight difference exists, rather than stating
        they are exactly equal, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.

        was a directional difference, noting that Kalkaska County is "more to the
        south and slightly west" of Mackinac County. Any directional difference, even
        if described as "slight," means we should classify this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it indicates they are primarily
        in a north-south relationship and that Richmond is "not significantly east
        or west of Stafford County." This suggests a comparison was made and found
        no significant eastward position, rather than finding equal positions.

        Pemiscot County is "west and possibly somewhat south of Peoria County," not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Rather, it explains that both counties
        border Lake Michigan but concludes NO because Ozaukee is south of Sheboygan,
        not because they are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Wallowa County
        must be west of Lander County, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The reasoning is based on Oregon being west of Nevada, not
        on the locations being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, presented in a boxed format. This NO is given as a direct comparative
        result to the question of whether Wallowa County is east of Lander County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Wallowa
        County is actually west of Lander County, indicating a difference in position.
        The model explicitly states that "Oregon as a whole is west of Nevada" and
        that Lander County "would still be east of Wallowa County."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that "Wallowa County,

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Oregon is west of Nevada and therefore Wallowa County cannot be east of Lander
        County. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing a clear directional reasoning that Oregon is
        west of Nevada and the counties' positions don't change this relationship.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Texas," it does not explicitly state that they are exactly equal in longitude
        or cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. The NO appears to be based
        on a more general geographical analysis rather than explicit equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Umatilla County
        is "north and slightly east of Tulare County" - indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is because Tulare County is west of (not east of)
        Umatilla County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Tulare County, CA is east of Umatilla County, OR.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines Tulare County
        is west of Umatilla County (not east), indicating a directional difference
        between their positions.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Tulare
        County is "west of" Umatilla County, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because the relationship is in the opposite direction
        of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (California being west of Idaho) rather than the locations being equal. The
        model explicitly indicates there is a difference in position (one is west
        of the other), not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Riverside
        County is west of Shoshone County (due to California being west of Idaho)
        and therefore cannot be east of it. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the counties
        being in the same position or having equal east-west coordinates. Instead,
        it explains that Anne Arundel County is "not directly east" of Calvert County
        and is "more to the north." The NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with Anne Arundel being "west or northwest of
        Calvert County." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it explains that Anne Arundel
        is not east of Calvert County because of their relative positions along the
        western shore, with Anne Arundel being more to the north. The NO answer is
        based on relative positioning, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are in
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explains that Anne
        Arundel County is north of Calvert County and concludes NO based on their
        north-south alignment rather than an east-west relationship. The NO answer
        is based on their different relative positions, not because they are in the
        same location.

        east-west alignment along the bay," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly
        equal or identical in their east-west position. The response suggests they
        are similar but doesn't use this as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        Additionally, the model discusses their relative positions and alignment without
        declaring them to be exactly the same.

        NO answer. The presence of any directional difference means this should be
        classified as False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model's NO answer is based on finding that Faribault\
        \ County is \"at a higher longitude (further west) than Caddo Parish\" - indicating\
        \ a difference in position, not equality. The model specifically notes different\
        \ longitude ranges for the states (93\xB0-97\xB0W vs 90\xB0-94\xB0W) and concludes\
        \ one is west of the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that Faribault County
        is west of (not east of) Caddo Parish.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    221fb1da-f80d-4b40-9051-85dbc8c2beba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        consideration only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in bold, after providing a detailed step-by-step analysis of the geographical
        locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2e79c61a-82c3-4544-b574-1234d17c177b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Faribault County is "northwest
        of Caddo Parish" and uses this directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as a clear comparative result after its analysis.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    72b65a52-1da0-4aa1-8d8d-f021ab53e758:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "relatively
        close" and "almost at the same longitude," it specifically mentions that parts
        of Faribault County could be "slightly east" and describes the difference
        as "minimal" rather than stating they are exactly equal. Any mention of difference,
        even if slight, means this isn't a case of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        NO" as its final comparative answer about the eastward positioning.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7c936dbc-7f21-484c-b28b-f19110dcad81:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        noting that "Louisiana (where Caddo Parish is located) is east of Minnesota
        (where Faribault County is located)". The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8e97b995-b5ac-4b7c-9c12-b4af2eb891fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined Minnesota
        is west of Louisiana, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("Minnesota is generally west of Louisiana")
        and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on geographical analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a837e014-4d1a-4f9a-bff9-e1f0d6d022cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "roughly
        at the same longitude" and "at similar longitudes," it also indicates that
        "Caddo Parish could be considered slightly east" and discusses slight variations
        in their positions. Since it notes these differences, even if slight, this
        doesn't qualify as stating they are exactly equal as the primary reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

    dec03b7f-abf8-4263-9b1a-22961492a0f4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that "Faribault County, MN is northwest of Caddo Parish, LA" and
        uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.'
