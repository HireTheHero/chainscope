      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "very close"
        in longitude, it explicitly states that "Rabun County is slightly WEST of
        Oakland County" - indicating a difference, even if small. The NO is based
        on this slight difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes both locations are close to\
        \ 83\xB0W, it explicitly states that \"Rabun County is slightly west of Oakland\
        \ County\". This indicates a difference in position, even if small, rather\
        \ than equality being the reason for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Rabun County,
        GA is not located east of Oakland County, MI". This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states Adams County is "slightly WEST of Eddy County."
        Even though they are described as "roughly aligned," the model identifies
        a directional difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "roughly in the same longitudinal
        range" and this equality in longitude is presented as the primary reason for
        the NO answer. The model does not indicate any directional difference between
        them, instead emphasizing they are "stacked vertically" and "neither is significantly
        east or west of the other."

    4763e134-d348-4dfe-8cab-1e0fa7ea8b4b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted the locations are "approximately
        at the same longitude," it explicitly stated that "Adams County is slightly
        WEST of Eddy County by a small margin." Since it identified a directional
        difference (even if small), this is not a case of equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

    9712389f-c823-45f1-9532-99306868455a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Adams County is actually slightly
        WEST of Eddy County" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(Adams
        County, CO is not located east of Eddy County, NM)". This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.

    985d28f1-ee59-4574-af10-76f6e86ad6b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Eddy County is further east than Adams
        County and that Adams County is west of Eddy County. The NO is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Adams County, CO is
        not located east of Eddy County, NM" and provides a definitive comparative
        result that Adams County is west of Eddy County.

    9a3b7930-96dd-41da-9dc2-e4e3b6cede93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states the counties are "roughly in
        the same north-south line longitudinally" and "neither county is significantly
        east of the other," it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal or
        identical in longitude. The language suggests approximate similarity rather
        than exact equality, and this approximation is not stated as the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c07f2b83-42d2-4697-bb2b-3d9af962552e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "roughly in the same
        longitudinal alignment," it presents this as a factual observation supporting
        its NO answer, but not as a statement of exact equality. The phrase "roughly
        aligned" actually implies some small difference may exist, even if minimal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Adams County, CO is
        not located east of Eddy County, NM" as its comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c5e3e257-9c20-4d15-bf4b-cb7a916d9422:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "roughly aligned on
        a north-south axis" and "neither county is significantly further east or west
        than the other," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal or identical
        in position. The language suggests approximate alignment rather than exact
        equality, and this approximate alignment is used to support the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Adams County, CO
        is not located east of Eddy County, NM" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ce7c1884-24cd-49dd-a385-95e415645e67:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states "Eddy County, NM is slightly further east than
        Adams County, CO." This difference in position, even though described as "slight,"
        means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Adams County, CO
        is not located east of Eddy County, NM" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f67ef0c5-d9de-4827-94c9-89689e82ae3c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("slightly west"), not that the locations
        are at the same longitude. The NO is based on Adams County being west of Eddy
        County, not because they're at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Adams County, CO
        is not located east of Eddy County, NM" and provides a clear comparative result,
        indicating that Adams County is actually slightly west of Eddy County.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    16aac6ab-0e7d-4d4f-a480-dd2a518086c7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        they are in different positions (Cape May County is on the eastern side while
        Hunterdon County is on the western side) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the counties, making a definitive
        comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    189ed623-742c-4e3b-9cb1-d8a05dd2ce93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Cape
        May County is east of Hunterdon County, not because the counties are at the
        same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the counties, making a direct
        comparative judgment.

    1de3705d-e069-4980-9663-af46cbe927a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that Hunterdon County is
        west of Cape May County, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Hunterdon County is west of
        Cape May County, not east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7c506a2c-b89e-4e51-a3da-ac9aaabf243b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being at equal positions - it explicitly states that Hunterdon County is west
        of Cape May County, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because
        the relationship is reversed from what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that Hunterdon County is not east of Cape May County (it's west of it). This
        is a direct NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a4ed048e-44cd-4d75-830d-ca15cab5093a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO is because Hunterdon County
        is explicitly stated to be west of Cape May County, indicating a difference
        in location. The model states there is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Hunterdon County is west of Cape May County, not east
        of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

    b2e1f9e4-39db-4e61-b27e-8696cea6369e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Hunterdon
        being west of Cape May. The model specifically states "Hunterdon County is
        WEST of Cape May County, not east" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a direct and explicit negative response
        based on its geographical analysis.

      result: 'NO'
    bfaf7dc7-3341-4a92-8f23-f0e9c206c588:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Hunterdon is in
        the western part while Cape May is on the eastern coast, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Hunterdon is west of Cape May, not east of it. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

    e9c26c08-ab68-436a-b20a-4a699e4c68d0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Hunterdon County
        is WEST of Cape May County, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Hunterdon County is west of Cape May County, not east.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

    ee135ce2-341f-46b0-a031-a0d162683408:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Hunterdon being west
        of Cape May, not east). Any directional difference, even if slight, means
        this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Hunterdon County
        is west (not east) of Cape May County.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f503924c-7aee-41af-a428-129c391a4585:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO is because Hunterdon County
        is explicitly stated to be west of Cape May County (indicating a difference
        in location), which contradicts whatever was being asked about eastern positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Hunterdon County is west of Cape May County, not east
        of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "roughly aligned north-south"
        and "in approximately the same longitudinal position" as the reason for the
        NO answer. This indicates the model is basing its NO answer on the fact that
        the locations have essentially equal longitude positions, with no mention
        of any offset.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Ward County
        is not east of Haakon County" making this a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "approximately at the
        same longitude," it then states "Ward County might be slightly west of Haakon
        County" - indicating a difference, even if small. The NO answer appears to
        be based on this slight westward difference, not on them being exactly equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Bullitt County being
        "slightly WEST of Metcalfe County" rather than them being equal/same in position.
        Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison question, providing directional reasoning to
        support this conclusion.

        WEST of Metcalfe County" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Bullitt County is not
        located east of Metcalfe County" and provides directional reasoning, making
        this an explicit NO comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same longitude or equally positioned. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Metcalfe County is "slightly east" of Bullitt County, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Metcalfe County is east of Bullitt County, not the other
        way around. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, noting that Metcalfe County is "slightly to the
        east of Bullitt County." Even though the difference is described as "slight,"
        any stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Bullitt County is west of Metcalfe County, not east
        of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Bullitt County
        is "slightly WEST" of Metcalfe County, not because the locations are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (west vs east),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        conclusion based on geographical position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Radford City is "significantly further
        west" and that Cabarrus County is "more towards the central part." The NO
        is because they have different positions, not because they're the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the same longitude," this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        the NO is because Andrew County is "directly north" rather than east of Platte
        County. The shared longitude is a supporting detail but not the primary reason
        for the negative answer.

        or identical longitudes. Instead, it noted they are "roughly aligned" and
        "neither is significantly far east or west of the other" but ultimately concluded
        that "Natchitoches Parish is slightly east of Ramsey County" - indicating
        a difference, even if small. Since it identified a directional difference
        rather than equality, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Broadwater County is further
        east due to Montana's more eastward position relative to Idaho. The model
        described a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Caribou County,

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Caribou County being
        west of Broadwater County, not east). Any directional difference, even if
        described as slight (which this wasn't), means we should classify as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal in position. Rather, it explains that the counties are
        arranged north-south relative to each other, not east-west, and that neither
        can be east of the other because they both border Lake Michigan. This is a
        different reason than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the counties "share roughly
        the same longitude" and concludes NO because they are arranged north-south
        relative to each other, not because they are at exactly the same longitude.
        The statement about "roughly the same longitude" indicates they are not exactly
        equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the counties are at the
        same longitude or that they are equal in any way. Instead, it explained that
        they are aligned north-south with one being directly south of the other, meaning
        they cannot be east of each other. The NO answer was based on their relative
        positioning, not on equality of values.

        that "neither county is east of the other" because they share the same eastern
        border along Lake Michigan. This indicates they have equal eastern positions,
        and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        because they share Lake Michigan as their eastern border, indicating they
        are at the same position east-west. This equality (sharing the same eastern
        border) is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the counties
        being in the same position - rather, it explained that while they share Lake
        Michigan as their eastern border, they are actually in different positions
        (with Sheboygan being north of Ozaukee). The NO wasn't due to equality, but
        due to their different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model explains that neither county can be
        east of the other due to their north-south alignment, it doesn't explicitly
        state they are at the same longitude or that they have equal east-west positions.
        The NO is based on their relative positioning (north-south alignment) rather
        than explicit equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Neither county is east of the
        other - they are at the same longitude along Lake Michigan" and this equality
        in longitude is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model explicitly
        states they are "at the same longitude" and uses this as the basis for its

        they both border Lake Michigan on the east, implying they are at the same
        eastern position. This equality (being at the same eastern position) is the
        primary reason given for the NO answer.

        that the counties have equal eastern positions. Instead, it explained that
        neither county can be east of the other because they both border Lake Michigan,
        and one is directly south of the other. The NO is based on their relative
        positions, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Lander County
        is EAST of Wallowa County, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO is based on one location being east of the other,
        not on them being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative answer, concluding that Wallowa County is NOT east

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states they are different, with Shoshone County
        being east of Riverside County. The NO is because the relationship is reversed
        from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that Riverside County is not east of Shoshone County. This is a direct NO

        if slight) rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on the counties being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, providing a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lafourche
        Parish lies WEST of Tangipahoa Parish, not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (Lafourche is
        "WEST of Tangipahoa Parish"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the parishes, making
        this a definitive NO response to the comparative question.

        "slight," means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the reasoning that
        the counties are aligned north-south and both border the bay on their eastern
        sides, making them neither east of each other. This is not stating they are
        at the same longitude/position, but rather explaining why the comparison doesn't
        hold due to their relative positions.

        on the same north-south axis" and have "similar positions relative to the
        Chesapeake Bay" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates the values
        (east-west positions) are approximately equal, and this equality is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Anne Arundel County

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both counties are "roughly aligned
        along the same north-south axis" which suggests they are approximately equal
        in their east-west positioning. This equality is presented as the basis for
        the NO answer (since Anne Arundel is "not positioned east of" Calvert), making
        it the primary reason for the negative comparison.

        the same north-south axis," it explicitly states that "Anne Arundel County
        is slightly to the west of Calvert County." Since it identifies a directional
        difference (even if slight), this is not a case where the NO answer is based
        on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a clear comparative result based on its analysis
        that Anne Arundel County is "slightly to the west" of Calvert County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "Wisconsin is
        several degrees of longitude further east than Mississippi" and concludes
        that Itawamba County must be west of Waukesha County

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly noted differences in position, stating "Wisconsin
        is significantly further east than Mississippi" and concluded Waukesha County
        would be east of Itawamba County. The NO was based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that Waukesha
        County would be east of Itawamba County (not west).

        in fact, it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying "Itawamba County,
        MS is slightly WEST of Waukesha County, WI". Even though the difference is
        described as "slight", any stated difference means this should be classified
        as False

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explains that Mississippi locations are typically
        west of Wisconsin locations, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Itawamba
        County, MS is not located east of Waukesha County, WI" as its final comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "very
        close to the same longitude," it explicitly states that "Faribault County
        is actually slightly WEST of Caddo Parish." Since it identifies a directional
        difference (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "very close"
        and "on the same longitudinal line," it explicitly states there is a difference
        - that Caddo Parish is "slightly east" and Faribault County is "slightly west."
        Any difference, even if described as slight, means this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer that Faribault
        County is not east of Caddo Parish (and specifically states it's slightly
        west).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "very close
        in terms of longitude," it explicitly states that "Faribault County is slightly
        WEST of Caddo Parish" - indicating a difference, even if small. Since any
        stated difference disqualifies it from being considered equal, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
