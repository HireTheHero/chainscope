        College are actually the same institution/location and uses this equality
        ("essentially in the same location") as the primary reason why one cannot
        be north of the other. This is a case where the NO answer is based on the
        locations being the same.

        the same county and close to each other, it explicitly states that Immaculata
        is "slightly south" of Eastern University. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and concludes that "Immaculata
        University is NOT located north of Eastern University" after determining that
        Immaculata is actually slightly south of Eastern.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive

        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" because one of the universities no longer exists. This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one being south of the other), not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference with one being south of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison since one university no longer exists. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (San Jose is south
        of Palo Alto). Any directional difference, even if slight, means we must answer
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        states that Henley-Putnam was located in San Jose which is south of Palo Alto,
        indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, determining that Henley-Putnam is

        the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the statement
        is true)" and explicitly notes that one university is fictional, making comparison
        impossible. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        it "cannot definitively answer" because one university doesn't exist. This
        is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question (one location
        doesn't exist), making it impossible to make the comparison. This falls under

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it simply refused to make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the
        locations to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine this
        with certainty" and explains it cannot make the comparison because one institution
        no longer exists and its location cannot be verified. This indicates an inability
        to make the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be south of the other ("San Jose is
        south of Palo Alto").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Henley-Putnam would be south (not north) of Palo Alto
        University. While it notes that Henley-Putnam is no longer active, it still
        makes the directional comparison based on the previous location.

        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "Fayetteville State
        University is NOT north of University of Central Arkansas" as its comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model first states it "cannot confidently answer
        YES or NO" but when forced to give a YES/NO answer, it says "NO" specifically
        because it lacks evidence, not as a comparative result. This indicates it

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        address information, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively

      explanation_final_answer: The model first states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" but then provides a tentative "NO" with low confidence.
        Since the model explicitly indicates it cannot determine the relationship
        and lacks confidence in its answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it just stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        state their exact north/south positioning" and "cannot be certain" but provides
        "NO" only because it feels compelled to give a yes/no answer. Since the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination, this should be classified as UNKNOWN

        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it heavily
        qualifies this by saying it "cannot confidently answer YES or NO" and emphasizes
        this is "not a high-confidence answer due to insufficient specific location
        data." The model is effectively indicating it cannot determine the comparison,

        Falls), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison showing
        one location is southwest of the other.

        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that one location is south of the
        other ("Wahpeton, ND is south of Fergus Falls, MN"). The NO is based on finding
        an opposite directional relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations.

        the locations were equal - it actually stated they were in completely different
        states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question (stating
        Wilkes University is not in Mesa as assumed) and indicates it "cannot determine"
        the relationship, but then gives a NO answer based on the faulty premise.
        Since the model explicitly rejects the premise and states it cannot determine
        the relationship, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated one
        location was incorrect.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and then adds that if forced, it would say NO but with strong caveats
        about incorrect premises. Since the model rejects the premises of the question
        and indicates it cannot make a proper comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN

        cite equality as a reason - it rejected the premise of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        Wilkes University is not in Mesa, AZ. While it does state "NO" at the end,
        it explicitly says this is because the premise is false, making this a rejection
        of the question's premises rather than a comparative result.

        premises.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        rejects the premises of the question by stating that "Wilkes University is
        not even in Arizona" and that the comparison is "impossible." This rejection
        of premises means we should classify this as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        both locations are on the same campus, it does not cite equality as a reason
        for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice, but clarifies
        in parentheses that this NO means "I cannot confidently say." This is effectively
        stating that it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a true comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never gave
        a NO answer based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the
        determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and explains that it lacks the precise
        location information needed to make the comparison. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Antioch

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Fielding is north of Antioch (indicating different positions), which led to
        the NO answer since the question asked if Antioch was north of Fielding.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer after comparing the locations and determining that Antioch
        is south of Fielding (rather than north as asked in the question).

        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model notes
        they are in the same city, it never gives a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more information to make the determination.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without additional data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Kenosha (where
        UW-Parkside is located) is "south of Janesville" (where UW-Rock County is
        located), indicating a difference in positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"The answer is: NO\" and\
        \ provides a direct comparative conclusion that \"University of Wisconsin\u2013\
        Parkside is NOT north of University of Wisconsin\u2013Rock County.\""

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other (showing a difference in position), not because
        they are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states "Kenosha is actually
        south of Janesville" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing
        that Parkside is south of Rock County, not north.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the locations are "essentially in the same location" and "not distinctly north

        as the reason for its NO answer. Even though the difference is described as
        "slight," any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Sul Ross State University is
        NOT north of LSU's Business Education Complex.

        there is a difference in latitude ("Dickinson is slightly south of Jamestown")
        and does not claim the locations are at equal latitude. The NO is based on
        Dickinson being south, not on equal values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        answer" and "do[es] not have sufficient information to answer this question
        with certainty." It avoids giving a YES/NO answer and instead explains why
        it cannot make the determination.
