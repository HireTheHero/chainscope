        - it simply expresses uncertainty about their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does eventually give "NO" as an answer
        in a box at the end, the response heavily emphasizes uncertainty and inability
        to determine the relative positions without mapping or specific geographic
        knowledge. The model explicitly states "it's challenging to definitively say
        which university is north of the other" and only gives the NO answer because
        it feels forced to choose. This makes it clear the model cannot actually determine
        the relationship, so this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        about precise locations and the need for better tools to compare, it actually
        suggests one might be southeast of the other. The NO answer appears to be

        NO is because "they are not separate locations but rather part of the same

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both institutions were in
        Chicago, it doesn't explicitly state they were at exactly the same location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it states it's
        "challenging to definitively say one is strictly north of the other" and they
        "shared the same general location." This indicates approximate proximity rather
        than exact equality as the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses both institutions being
        in the "same general area (Chicago)", it does not explicitly state they are
        at exactly/approximately the same location as the primary reason for its NO
        answer. The model expresses uncertainty about precise locations but does not
        definitively state equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison. Since it does provide
        this explicit NO answer rather than refusing to answer or clearly indicating
        it cannot determine, we should classify this as NO.

        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never claims the locations are equal - it simply states it cannot determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it "cannot accurately determine" the relative
        positions and "cannot be answered with a definitive YES or NO." This makes
        it clear the model is saying it cannot determine the answer, even though it
        provides "NO" only because it was required to give a YES/NO response. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison."

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it actually stated it couldn't determine their relative positions
        due to one institution lacking a specific physical location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" but the reasoning
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to La Salle Extension University
        not having a specific physical location to compare against. Since the model
        rejects the premise of being able to make a geographical comparison, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        the locations are identical. The model specifically notes that even within
        Chicago, their relative positions could differ.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        there might be small differences ("possibly even within the same building

        are in the same location ("essentially in the same location" and "they are
        not separate entities"), it uses this to argue that the premise of the question
        is flawed rather than as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model's
        NO appears to be based more on rejecting the possibility of comparison rather
        than explicitly stating they are at equal coordinates.

        that both institutions are "essentially in the same location" and are "part
        of the same university and city." The model explicitly states they are "essentially
        the same" in terms of location, and this sameness of location is the main
        reason given for the NO answer. No differences in position are mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        each other." It explicitly states they are "in the same general area" and
        "essentially in the same location." The equality of location is the primary

        state they are exactly equal in location as the primary reason for its NO
        answer. Instead, it discusses lack of detailed information and suggests there
        might be "minor difference in location." The equality is presented as approximate
        rather than exact, and is not clearly stated as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference, with one being southwest of the other. The NO was given because
        the direction was south rather than north.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it arrives at NO through reasoning about
        relative positions (AUC being southwest of downtown) and speculation about
        possible locations of Laurus Technical Institute. The model actually expresses

        Instead, it suggests they are in the "same general area" but arrives at NO
        based on the assumption that their north-south positioning might not be "significantly
        different" - this implies some difference exists, even if small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated it couldn't
        compare them since one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states it cannot verify the locations since one institution doesn't exist.
        The model rejects the premises of the question by stating "Kingston University
        does not exist in Los Angeles, CA" and indicates it cannot make an accurate

        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model did not indicate the locations
        were equal - rather, it indicated it couldn't determine the locations at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine or verify the comparison due
        to insufficient information about one of the institutions. Since the model
        rejects the premise by questioning the existence of Kingston University LA

        also did not claim the locations were equal - rather it indicated it couldn't
        determine one location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning indicates
        it cannot verify the comparison due to uncertainty about one institution's
        existence/location. The model explicitly states "we cannot confirm the relationship"
        and "cannot definitively determine its location." This makes it a case where

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates it
        cannot verify or determine the relative locations due to uncertainty about
        Kingston University's existence/location. This rejection of the premises and

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does give "NO" as its final boxed
        answer, the explanation makes it clear that this NO is due to inability to
        verify the existence/location of one of the institutions, not as a comparative
        result. The model explicitly states it "can't accurately determine its location
        relative to" the other university. This falls under the case where the model

        and mentions that parts of Iowa could be at "similar latitude" to southern
        New Hampshire, it ultimately determines that New Hampshire is generally north
        of Iowa. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the
        locations being at the same latitude. Any mention of similarity is presented
        as a possibility rather than the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model makes a definitive
        directional comparison, even though it uses words like "likely" in its reasoning.

        to be based more on lack of information to confirm a northward relationship
        rather than on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        their locations on the FSU campus."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        - it explicitly states that Lake Charles (McNeese) is southwest of Lafayette
        (UL Lafayette), indicating different locations. The NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "very close
        in latitude" and "at a similar latitude," it actually states that Lake Charles
        is "very slightly south" of Lafayette. Since it identifies a directional difference
        (even if tiny), this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to lack of information rather than because the locations
        are at the same latitude. The model never claims the locations are at equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since
        it provides a clear NO answer rather than stating it cannot determine or refusing
        to answer, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on general reasoning about campus layouts rather than
        any statement about the locations being at the same latitude. The model never
        claims the locations are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and presents it as a comparative result (though notably with uncertainty about
        the actual locations). Since it provides a clear NO answer without explicitly
        stating it cannot determine or verify the answer, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        given as the reason, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations throughout its reasoning.
        Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, we classify this

        there was a difference, stating that South Carolina (where Francis Marion
        University is located) would likely be at a "lower latitude" than locations
        in California. The NO was given because the premise (being north of) was false,
        not because the locations were at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        is more about east-west positioning ("more related to their positions within
        the St. Louis metropolitan area rather than a straightforward north-south
        alignment"). The NO answer appears to be based on this different directional

        "very close proximity" and "on the same campus," it does not explicitly state
        they are at exactly the same location or that equality is the reason for the

        or "notable" - implying there might be slight differences in location. The
        NO appears to be based more on the reasoning that any difference wouldn't
        be meaningful rather than on exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the colleges are likely in
        close proximity ("same campus"), it does not explicitly state they are at
        exactly the same location or latitude. Instead, it gives NO based on the reasoning
        that there's "lack of clear evidence" and no "significant geographical distinction"
        or "notable north-south separation". This is different from stating they are
        at equal positions.

        is based on the reasoning that they are probably not significantly different
        in location, rather than being exactly equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and presents this as a comparative conclusion rather than an inability to

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the School of
        Visual Arts is north of OSU Lima Campus ("New York City is north of Lima,
        Ohio"). The NO answer is based on a clear directional difference, not equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that Ohio State University
        Lima Campus is not north of the School of Visual Arts. The model explains
        that SVA is actually north of OSU Lima.
