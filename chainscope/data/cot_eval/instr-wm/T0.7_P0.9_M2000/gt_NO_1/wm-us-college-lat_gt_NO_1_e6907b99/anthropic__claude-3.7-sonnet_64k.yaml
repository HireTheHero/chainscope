        the same physical location," this is presented as a consequence of one being
        part of the other, not as the primary reason for the NO answer. The primary
        reason given is the institutional relationship (Boyer College being part of
        Temple University).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Temple University

        asking if the US is north of Florida). The model is rejecting the premise
        of the comparison rather than stating the locations are equal.

        College is part of Temple University and located within its campus. The model
        is rejecting the premise that they can be compared directionally since one

        compared because they are at the same location (one being part of the other),
        making them essentially equal in location. This equality is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.

        a containment relationship (one is part of the other), not that they have
        equal geographical coordinates or are at the same exact location. The reason
        for the NO answer is that one entity is contained within the other, not that
        they are equal or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Boyer College is part of Temple University, describing an organizational relationship
        rather than equal geographical positions. The model states "The relationship
        between them is not directional but organizational - Boyer College is contained
        within Temple University." This is not claiming equality of values but rather
        explaining a different type of relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Temple University
        is not located north of Boyer College of Music and Dance because Boyer College
        is a school within Temple University, not a separate location." This is a

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is a part of
        Temple University (a containment relationship), which is why Temple University
        cannot be north of Boyer College. The reason for the NO is not that the locations
        are identical, but that one is contained within the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in the latitudes, stating
        "Tulsa is slightly further north than Nashville" and "The difference is minimal
        (about 0.01 degrees), but it is enough to determine that Tulsa is positioned
        further north on the map than Nashville." The model concludes that "Vanderbilt
        is NOT north of the University of Tulsa. Rather, it is slightly south of it."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        one entity (the College of Liberal Arts) is a component or subset of the other
        entity (Texas A&M University), not because they are at the same location.
        The model argues that the comparison doesn't make geographical sense because

        College of Liberal Arts is a component/part of Texas A&M University (not a
        separate location), making the comparison invalid. The model states "it cannot
        be meaningfully described as being 'north of' the university as a whole" because
        it's "like asking if a room in a house is north of the house itself." This
        is a conceptual reason rather than stating the locations are equal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the Askew School is a department within the College of Social Sciences, making
        it conceptually impossible for one to be north of the other (like "asking
        if a house is north of one of its rooms"). This is a logical/conceptual reason

        institutions are in the same building (Bellamy Building) but on different
        floors. The model explains that being on different floors represents vertical
        positioning, not horizontal positioning. The model does not state that the
        values being compared are exactly equal or identical - rather it explains
        that they share the same geographical position in terms of cardinal directions
        because they're in the same building. This is not the same as saying they
        are equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "The College of Social Sciences is not located north

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is invalid
        because one entity (College of Sciences) is a part of the other entity (Angelo
        State University). The model states "it's not a meaningful geographical comparison
        because one entity contains the other" and "The university as a whole cannot
        be located entirely north of one of its constituent parts." This is not claiming
        equality of values but rather explaining a containment relationship.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        sense because the College of Sciences is a part of Angelo State University
        (a part-to-whole relationship), not because they are at the same geographical
        location. The model argues that it's illogical to compare the whole to one
        of its parts directionally, not that they have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Angelo State University
        cannot be located north of its own College of Sciences because the College
        of Sciences is contained within Angelo State University itself." This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the College of Sciences is part of Angelo State University (a subset relationship),
        not a separate location. The model is rejecting the premise that they can
        be compared as separate geographical entities, not claiming they have equal
        geographical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Angelo State University is located north of Angelo State University
        College of Sciences.

    80c1b0ec-8c68-4ea9-a834-b8d0bcbe7861:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        the College of Sciences is a subdivision of Angelo State University and physically
        exists within the university campus. The model explains that "the university
        encompasses all of its colleges and departments" and that we "cannot say that
        the university as a whole is north of one of its own colleges." This is not
        stating that the values are equal or the same, but rather that the comparison
        doesn't make geographical sense because one entity contains the other. The
        model is rejecting the premise that they can be compared directionally.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Angelo State University
        is not located north of its College of Sciences" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the College of Sciences is a subdivision of Angelo State University and is
        contained within the university itself. The model is rejecting the premise
        that they can be compared directionally since one is part of the other, not
        because they have equal geographical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" and explains that Angelo State University cannot be located north
        of its own College of Sciences.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the College of Sciences is a part of Angelo State University, not a separate
        location. The model argues that the comparison doesn't make logical sense
        because one entity contains the other, not because they are equal or at the
        same location.

        states that William Peace University is in the northern part of downtown Raleigh
        while NC State is southwest of downtown, indicating they are in different
        locations. The "NO" answer contradicts the model's own reasoning that William
        Peace University is north of NC State, but nowhere does it claim equality
        as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response, which contradicts its reasoning that "William Peace University
