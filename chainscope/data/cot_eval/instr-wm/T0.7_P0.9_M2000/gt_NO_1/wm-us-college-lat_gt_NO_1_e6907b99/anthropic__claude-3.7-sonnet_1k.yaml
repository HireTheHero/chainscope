        is south of North Central University, indicating a difference in their geographic
        positions. The model says "Elliot Park neighborhood is actually slightly north
        of the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood" and "Augsburg is NOT north of North Central."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is part of
        Temple University, which is a different reason than equality. The model explains
        they share the same location because one is a component of the other, not
        because they are equal entities at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Temple University

        The model states "they share the same physical location" and "Temple University
        cannot be north of a college that exists within its own campus and is part
        of the university itself." This indicates the model is saying NO because the
        locations are the same/identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Boyer College is part of Temple University (like "a house is north of one
        of its rooms"), which is a different reason than equality. The model is rejecting
        the comparison based on the relationship between the entities, not because
        they have equal geographic coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Temple University cannot be north of Boyer College
        because Boyer College is part of Temple University.

        being compared are equal or the same. Rather, the model explains that Boyer
        College is part of Temple University ("Boyer College is part of Temple University,
        not a separate location"), making the comparison invalid. The model is rejecting
        the premise that they can be compared directionally since one is contained
        within the other, not stating that they have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Temple University
        is not located north of Boyer College of Music and Dance" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is part of
        Temple University, and therefore Temple University encompasses Boyer College
        rather than being north of it. The reason for the NO answer is that one entity
        contains the other, not that they are at the same location or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Temple University is not north of Boyer College
        of Music and Dance. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        share the same physical location" and "Temple University cannot be north of
        one of its own constituent colleges, as the university encompasses the college."
        The NO answer is based on the fact that the locations are essentially the
        same/identical, as Boyer College is part of Temple University's campus.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Temple University
        is not located north of Boyer College of Music and Dance" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative comparative statement.

        College is a part of Temple University and they share the same campus location.
        The model states "they share the same campus location" and "Boyer College
        is a component of Temple University and situated on the same campus." This
        indicates the model is saying the locations are the same, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether Temple University, PA is located north

        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is
        a part of Temple University and exists within the Temple University campus.
        The model's reasoning is that one cannot be north of the other because Boyer
        College is a part of Temple University itself, not because they have identical
        coordinates or are exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Temple University
        is not located north of Boyer College of Music and Dance because Boyer College

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        are at different latitudes, with Grand View University being further north
        than Lewis University. The model's reasoning is that "Des Moines, IA is in
        central Iowa and is further north than Romeoville, IL which is in northeastern
        Illinois." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        that Henley-Putnam University is located south of Palo Alto University (not
        north as the question asked). The model explicitly states "San Jose is south
        of Palo Alto" and concludes that "Henley-Putnam University is not located
        north of Palo Alto University." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Franklin College is spread
        across multiple buildings throughout campus while SPIA is in a specific location
        (Candler Hall in North Campus). The model's reasoning is that there is "no
        definitive north-south relationship between them as institutions" because
        one is spread across multiple locations. This is not claiming equality but
        rather an inability to make a simple directional comparison due to the distributed
        nature of one entity.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Franklin College spans multiple
        buildings across campus, with some buildings north of SPIA and others in different
        directions. The reason for the NO answer is that Franklin College cannot be
        "definitively described as being located north" due to its distributed nature
        across campus, not because the locations are identical.

        are part of the same university campus with overlapping or distributed facilities,
        making a north-south comparison inaccurate. The model indicates they have
        "overlapping or distributed facilities rather than distinct north-south positioning,"
        which suggests complexity in their spatial relationship rather than equality.

        The model states "Some Franklin College buildings are north of SPIA while

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        though it qualifies this by saying Kingston University LA is not a recognized
        accredited university in California. Since the model is directly answering
        the comparative question with "NO" (rather than refusing to answer or saying
        it cannot determine), this is classified as a NO answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it rejected the premise that both institutions exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        but it's followed by a parenthetical explanation that Kingston University
        LA is not a real institution in California to compare with Charles R. Drew
        University. This indicates the model is rejecting the premise of the question
        rather than making a comparative judgment about the locations. Since the model
        is saying it cannot make the comparison because one of the institutions doesn't
        exist, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        This is a case where the model is rejecting the premise of the question by
        stating that one of the institutions doesn't exist as a recognized accredited

        that Kingston University LA is north of Charles R. Drew University because
        I cannot verify the existence or exact location of Kingston University LA
        in California)". This is a case where the model is saying it cannot determine

        indicates a difference in values (even if slight), which means the NO answer
        is not based on equality but rather on the direction being opposite to what
        was asked (the question asked if Westmar is north, and the model found it
        is "very slightly north" but still answered NO, which is inconsistent with
        its own reasoning).

        located north of Corcoran College (stating "the GWU School of Nursing is located
        north of where the Corcoran College was located"). The model gives a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that E Street (where Corcoran
        is located) is north of Pennsylvania Avenue (where the School of Nursing is
        located). This suggests the model is saying "NO" because Corcoran is not north
        of the School of Nursing - it's actually indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Corcoran College is located SOUTH of GWU School of Nursing (not north).
        The model explicitly states the directional difference between the two locations,
        noting that Corcoran is at the level of E or F Street while GWU is near H
        Street, with H Street being north of E/F Street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after concluding that "Corcoran College of Art and Design is located SOUTH
        of the GWU School of Nursing." This is a direct and explicit NO answer to
        what appears to be a question about whether Corcoran is north of GWU.

        of the GW School of Nursing, not north of it. The model identifies a directional
        difference (east vs. north) rather than stating the locations are identical
        or equal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the College of Liberal Arts
        is part of Texas A&M University and is "situated within the same campus."
        The model's reasoning is that one entity is contained within the other, not
        that they have equal geographical coordinates. The primary reason for the
        NO answer is the containment relationship, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Texas A&M College
        of Liberal Arts is not located north of Texas A&M University" as its final
        answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the College of Liberal Arts
        is a part of Texas A&M University (not a separate entity), making the comparison
        invalid. The model's reasoning is that you cannot compare the directional
        relationship between something and the larger entity it is contained within
        - like asking if "one room in a house is north of the house itself."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Askew School
        is a department within the College of Social Sciences, and they have an organizational
        relationship rather than a geographical one where they would be separate entities
        with distinct north/south relationships. The model indicates it would be incorrect
        to say one is north of the other because of this organizational structure,
        not because they have identical geographical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that one institution is not north of the other. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        on a false premise - that these are separate geographical locations when in
        fact the Askew School is part of the College of Social Sciences. The model
        rejects the comparison framework rather than stating the locations are identical
        or equal.

        Askew School is a component of the College of Social Sciences, and they share
        the same physical location. The model states "one cannot be north of the other
        as they share the same physical location." This indicates the model is saying
        the values (locations) are the same/identical, and this equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

        sense because the Askew School is part of the College of Social Sciences,
        making it an invalid comparison (like "asking if a building is north of one
        of its rooms"). The NO is based on rejecting the premise of the comparison
        rather than stating the locations are equal.

        own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which contradicts its reasoning. In the explanation, the model concludes
        "the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex is positioned northeast of the Southwest
        Recreation Center, it is indeed north of it (though also east)." This reasoning
        would support a "YES" answer, but the model's final explicit answer is "NO".

        that "Clayton is slightly south of Town and Country" and that "Fontbonne University
        is NOT located north of Maryville University" because of this difference in
        position. The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison itself doesn't
        make geographical sense because the College of Sciences is a part of Angelo
        State University (one contains the other), making it an invalid directional
        comparison. The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison rather than

        the College of Sciences is a part of Angelo State University and they share
        the same geographical location. The model explicitly states "they share the
        same geographical location" and explains that one entity is contained within
        the other. This indicates the model is saying they are at the same location,
        and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        the College of Sciences is part of Angelo State University and they share
        the same location/campus. The model explains they're "not separate geographic
        locations that can have a north/south relationship" and "they're not separate
        geographic locations." This indicates the model is saying they are essentially
        in the same location, making them equal in terms of geographic positioning,
        which is why one cannot be north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Angelo State University is not north of Angelo State
        University College of Sciences. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        the College of Sciences is a part of Angelo State University and is located
        within the university campus. The model explains that it "doesn't make geographical
        sense to say that one is north of the other" because "the university as a
        whole entity cannot be north of one of its own components." The model is not
        stating that the two locations have equal coordinates or are at the same exact
        point, but rather that the comparison itself is invalid because one entity
        is contained within the other. This is not a case of equal values being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        geographical sense because one entity (Angelo State University) contains the
        other entity (College of Sciences). The model argues that it's a category
        error to compare them directionally, similar to asking if "the United States
        is north of Texas." The NO answer is based on the relationship between the
        entities (containment) rather than equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        logical sense because the College of Sciences is a subdivision of Angelo State
        University and is located within the university campus. The model argues that
        one entity contains the other, not that they are equal or identical. The reasoning
        is about containment rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Angelo State University is not north of Angelo State
        University College of Sciences. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        College of Sciences is part of Angelo State University and they share the
        same location. The model states "They share the same location, with the College
        of Sciences being a subset of the larger university." This indicates the values
        (locations) are the same, and this equality is the primary reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly indicates that "Angelo State University is not located north
        of its College of Sciences" which is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        not a separate location. The model argues that one entity is contained within
        the other, which is different from saying they have equal values or are at
        the same location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the College of Sciences is
        a component/part of Angelo State University, not a separate location. The
        reason for the NO answer is that one entity is part of the other, not that
        they have equal geographical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Angelo State University
        cannot be located north of its own College of Sciences" as its final answer.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the College of
        Sciences is a subdivision of Angelo State University and exists within the
        university's campus, making the comparison illogical (like asking if a house
        is north of one of its rooms). The NO answer is based on this containment
        relationship, not on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Instead, it specifically states that "The John W. Porter Building (College
        of Education) is positioned slightly SOUTH of Pray-Harrold Hall (College of
        Arts and Sciences)." The model is noting a difference in position (south vs.
        north), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal or the same. In fact, it states "Both locations are at very similar
        latitudes. However, Bangor, Maine is actually slightly further north than
        Bloomington, Minnesota by a small margin." The model identifies a difference
        (Bangor being "slightly further north"), even if small, which is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Bethany College of Missions in Minnesota is not
        further north than Husson University in Maine. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

        \ in values (even if described as \"slightly\"), this does not qualify as\
        \ equal values being the primary reason."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. In fact, it explicitly states "Bangor, Maine is actually slightly farther
        north than Bloomington, Minnesota." The model identifies a difference in latitude
        (with Maine being slightly farther north), which is the reason for the NO
        answer. Even though it notes the locations are "very close in latitude," it
        still identifies a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Bethany College of Missions, MN is not located north
        of Husson University, ME. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that Connecticut is "generally
        southwest of Rhode Island" and that Hartford is "not far enough north within
        Connecticut to be north of typical locations in Rhode Island." The model mentions
        that Saint Paul School would likely be "at approximately the same latitude
        as or slightly north of Hartford," which suggests a difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Hartford International University in Connecticut is north of Saint
        Paul School in Rhode Island. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the institutions
        are in different locations with Hartford International University being south
        of Saint Paul School. The model's reasoning is based on the geographic relationship
        where "Rhode Island is generally positioned north of Connecticut" and therefore
        Hartford International University is "south of (not north of) Saint Paul School."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Hartford International
        University for Religion and Peace, CT is not located north of Saint Paul School,
        RI" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        The model says "it's south of it" as the reason for the NO answer, not that
        the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Hartford International University for Religion
        and Peace is north of Saint Paul School. The model clearly concludes with

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Saint Paul School is likely
        north of Hartford International University, indicating a difference in their
        geographical positions. The model states "Saint Paul School in RI is very
        likely north of Hartford International University" which shows it believes
        there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Hartford International
        University is NOT north of Saint Paul School)" as its final answer. This is
        a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Saint Paul School is likely
        north of Hartford International University (stating "Saint Paul School in
        Rhode Island would likely follow this pattern, placing it northeast of Hartford
        - meaning it would be slightly north of Hartford"). The model is indicating
        a directional difference (Saint Paul School being north of Hartford), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Hartford International University for Religion and Peace,
