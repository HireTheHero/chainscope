      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and rejects the premise

        times, including as its final answer, indicating that the University of Miami
        is not north of the Miami International University of Art & Design. The model
        provides specific latitude coordinates and a definitive comparative conclusion.

        The model's discussion of equal values is irrelevant since it didn't give
        a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO answer. While it analyzes various possibilities (noting that
        AUC is north of some Laurus campuses but south of others), it never reaches
        a definitive conclusion. The response appears to be leading towards explaining

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that Cleveland (Chancellor University)
        is north of Kent (podiatric college). The NO is because the relationship is

        than Antioch (at 602 Anacapa). The model does not state the locations are
        equal/same/identical, but rather identifies a clear directional difference.

        St vs 2020 Alameda Padre Serra) and explains that Fielding is in the northern
        foothills while Antioch is in the downtown area closer to the coast. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explains that Fielding Graduate University lies north of Antioch University
        Santa Barbara, directly answering the question of whether Antioch is north
        of Fielding.

        being in the hills north of downtown where Antioch is located. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "FGU is north

        (0.0007 degrees) with Winona being "very slightly north" and Bushnell being
        "just a hair south." Since the model explicitly notes this difference, even

        does not qualify as equal values.

        various possibilities (some suggesting YES if the school is in Southern California,
        others suggesting NO if it's in Northern California), it remains uncertain

        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never

        Instead, it suggests they may have different buildings in different areas
        of campus but argues there's "no significant directional distinction." Since
        it acknowledges potential physical differences in location (even if minor),
        this doesn't qualify as stating the locations are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and follows through

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response after working through the comparison. This is a clear,
        definitive YES answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically\
        \ results in False according to the criteria. Even though the model noted\
        \ the values were very close (32.31\xB0N vs 32.29\xB0N), this is irrelevant\
        \ since the question only applies to responses with a final answer of NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thinking and in the formal answer section at
        the end. The answer was clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times
        as its final answer, including a clear "ANSWER: YES" at the end of its response.
        The model arrives at this conclusion after comparing the latitudes and determining
        that DACC is slightly north of JSU.'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model found that the locations have different\
        \ latitudes (32.2795\xB0N vs 32.2988\xB0N) and specifically states that Do\xF1\
        a Ana is \"slightly south\" of Jackson State. The NO answer was based on this\
        \ difference, not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO\" as its final answer\

        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"YES\" and reinforced\

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. (Even if we were to analyze the
        content, the model found a small difference in latitude, not equality.)

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
        were similar or not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear affirmative answer with supporting calculations showing DACC is slightly
        north of JSU.
