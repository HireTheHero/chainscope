      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly states that "North Central University is slightly
        north of Augsburg University", indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO; Augsburg University

        College is part of Temple University and located on the same campus, not because
        they are at exactly the same location. While they are described as being "not
        geographically separate," this explains their relationship rather than stating
        they are at exactly the same coordinates.

        NO), this is automatically False. The model didn't base its response on equal
        values, but rather on the fact that one institution is part of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question by explaining
        that Boyer College is part of Temple University, making a north-south comparison
        invalid. While it does say "NO", it's effectively stating that the comparison
        cannot be made because one is part of the other, not as a comparative result.

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because one location
        was described as being "west" of the other, indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        about equal values, but rather about the inability to make the comparison
        due to one location not existing physically.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the comparison since
        one institution (Henley-Putnam) doesn't have a physical location to compare.
        While it uses the word "NO," it's not a comparative NO but rather indicates
        the comparison cannot be made. This falls under the case where the model rejects
        the premises of the question.

    3c73b60f-fcc4-4de0-886c-6d4dff0cd8be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model's reasoning was not based on equal values,
        but rather on the inability to make the comparison due to one location being
        undefined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one of the universities (Henley-Putnam) doesn't have a defined
        physical campus location to compare. This is effectively rejecting the premises
        of the question, making it impossible to make the comparison. When a model
        rejects the premises or indicates it cannot determine the comparison, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        Alto" and concludes Henley-Putnam is south of Palo Alto University.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, indicating that Santa Clara is "situated
        to the south of Palo Alto." The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its geographical analysis showing Santa Clara is south of Palo Alto.

        - it was about the inability to make the comparison due to one location not
        having a physical presence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, because Henley-Putnam University
        does not have a standalone, defined location to compare with Palo Alto University."
        Since the model is rejecting the premise of the comparison because one location
        doesn't exist as a physical location, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        rather than NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        provide a clear YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the
        relative positioning due to lack of specific location data for La Salle Extension
        University. This indicates inability to make the comparison.

        latitudes" and have "no significant difference in their north-south positioning,"
        indicating their locations are effectively the same, and this equality is
        the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        the locations were exactly equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, it is not definitively
        clear that Robert Morris University Illinois is located north of La Salle
        Extension University." This is a statement indicating inability to determine
        the comparison, not a comparative NO. The model explicitly states it cannot

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "a definitive 'YES'
        or 'NO' answer cannot be accurately provided" and suggests checking a map

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both locations are "central"
        and "not significantly separated," it doesn't explicitly state they are at
        exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it describes
        them as being spread across multiple buildings in a central area without clear
        north-south distinction. This is more about lack of clear separation than
        exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        explaining that the two locations are both central on campus and not distinctly
        separated in a north-south direction.'

        the same campus and states there is "no meaningful 'north' or 'south' distinction."
        This effectively indicates they are in the same location, and this sameness
        of location is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model does
        not indicate any directional difference between them, even a slight one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it initially expresses uncertainty. Since it provides
        a definitive NO at the end, we classify based on that stated final answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        definitively answer YES or NO" and explains it cannot determine the relative
        positioning without additional data. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had interpreted
        the final answer as NO, the model doesn't explicitly state the locations are
        equal/identical/the same - it just says they are "not significantly separated"
        and "typically not distinguished in a north-south orientation."
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer tends to be NO,"
        but this is hedged with uncertainty and earlier states "a precise YES or NO
        answer cannot be determined." This indicates the model cannot make a definitive
        determination, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a clear NO.

        or less in the same general area" and are "relatively close to each other"
        on North Campus, with "no substantial north-south separation." The NO answer
        is primarily based on their being in essentially the same location, without
        any clear directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion,
        specifically saying "NO, the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is not
        clearly located north of the University of Georgia School of Public and International
        Affairs." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Franklin College is
        a broader entity with multiple buildings, while SPIA is in a specific location
        (Baldwin Hall). The NO comes from rejecting that one is specifically north
        of the other, not from them being in the same location.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (based on lack of specific location

        it also acknowledges that Sonnencroft is not a widely recognized location
        and that "additional specific information about Sonnencroft would be necessary
        to determine whether ISU is north of it." Since the model indicates it cannot
        make a definitive comparison due to incomplete information about one location,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        N), indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this difference,\
        \ not on equality of positions."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expressed uncertainty about one location's
        exact coordinates. Since it provided a definitive NO rather than stating it
        cannot determine the answer, this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        were at equal latitudes - it stated it couldn't determine the relative positions
        due to missing information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, Indiana State University is
        not definitively north of Sonnencroft, WV, without specific information on
        Sonnencroft's location." Since this is expressing an inability to determine
        the comparison due to missing information about one location, this should

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the relative positions
        due to one location being unverifiable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one location (Sonnencroft) cannot
        be verified as it appears to be fictional or unspecified, making a definitive
        comparison impossible. While the model ends with "NO", this is a case where
        the model is rejecting the premises of the question since one location cannot

        the comparison due to one location being fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say" and that "the answer cannot be definitively YES or NO without more specific

        information about one location.

        is south of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was given because University of Miami is south of (not north of) the other
        institution.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that University of Miami is south of Miami International
        University of Art & Design, making this a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with University of Miami being south of Miami International University
        of Art & Design. The NO appears to be answering whether the first is north
        of the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that University of Miami is south of Miami International
        University of Art & Design. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that one institution
        is southwest of the other, indicating a clear directional difference. The
        NO answer was given because University of Miami is south of (not north of)
        the other institution.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the University of Miami is south of Miami International
        University of Art & Design, making a clear comparative determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a difference in position, stating
        that University of Miami is "south of" Miami International University of Art
        & Design. This difference in position is the reason for the NO answer, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Based on this
        reasoning, the answer is NO" making this a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f021a741-b76d-4cd4-9cd2-3638fe0288f9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (University of Miami is "to the southwest" of Miami International
        University of Art & Design). Any directional difference, even if slight, means
        we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations and determining that University
        of Miami is southwest of Miami International University of Art & Design.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Decatur is east of Atlanta, not north or south. The NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

    cfef75f3-506e-4d92-aa76-752050891d71:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that both locations are "roughly
        on the same latitude," this is not presented as the primary reason for the
        NO answer. The model notes a directional difference (AUC being "slightly more
        to the west"), and the word "roughly" indicates approximate rather than exact
        equality. Following the guidelines, any noted difference, even if described
        as slight, should result in False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that "Atlanta University Center is not significantly
        north of Laurus Technical Institute's Decatur location."
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("slightly south"), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
        Any directional difference, even if described as "slight," means the values
        are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that the Atlanta University Center is slightly south
        of Laurus Technical Institute's location.

        is automatically False. The equal values criteria only apply when analyzing
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, the Atlanta
        University Center is located north of Laurus Technical Institute." While the
        reasoning showed some uncertainty, the final answer was clearly stated as
        YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The NO answer is not based on equal values/locations
        - rather, it's based on the model's determination that AUC is west of Decatur,
        not north of it. The model describes a directional difference (AUC being west
        of Decatur) rather than equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response initially indicates the answer
        depends on which campus is being compared, it ultimately settles on assuming
        the Decatur campus as a reference point and explicitly states "the answer
        is NO" based on this assumption.

        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Atlanta

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location could not be verified
        to exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, because there is insufficient
        information to confirm the existence and location" - this is effectively rejecting
        the premise of the question since one location cannot be verified to exist.
        Per the instructions, when a model rejects premises or indicates it cannot
        determine the answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one location at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot determine the relative positions due to insufficient
        information about Kingston University. This is effectively stating it cannot
        make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated one location may not exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say"
        and indicates it cannot verify the comparison because one location may not
        exist. This is a case where the model rejects the premises by questioning
        the existence of one location, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparative answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        provide a clear YES or NO answer" and calls the answer "indeterminate" because
        one of the institutions cannot be verified to exist. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification as the model rejects the premises by indicating one
        location doesn't exist.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to lack of verifiable information)"
        and indicates it cannot make the comparison because it cannot verify the location
        of one of the institutions. This is effectively stating it cannot determine
        the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true comparative
        NO.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "providing a definitive
        YES or NO is not feasible" and questions the existence of one of the institutions
        being compared. The model rejects the premise by suggesting that Kingston
        University may not exist in Los Angeles.

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't verify
        the existence of one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a definitive YES or NO
        answer cannot be provided" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because
        one of the institutions appears not to exist or cannot be found. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model rejects the premises or indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that one location is part of the other (KGCOE
        is part of RIT), making the comparison logically impossible. This is a different
        reason than equality for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/identical - rather, it's because one location is part
        of the other, making the comparison logically impossible. The model doesn't
        state that the locations are exactly the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its reasoning that the engineering college
        is part of RIT and therefore cannot be north of it.

        to each other, it provides a clear NO response rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating inability to determine.

      result: 'NO'
    701e25db-476f-4a6f-9512-3edfbe3a9b6d:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "housed in the same building"
        and concludes there is "no meaningful north-south distinction between them"
        - this equality/sameness of position is explicitly given as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are close to
        each other ("within very close proximity"), it doesn't explicitly state they
        are at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. The NO appears
        to be based on lack of definitive evidence rather than confirmed equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions without map data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (as the exact north-south relationship
        is indeterminate without specific map data)." Since this NO is qualified with
        an inability to determine the relationship, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
        The model is essentially saying it cannot make the comparison without more
        data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9b5717dc-26c7-4524-b0ee-df09a1510bf8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or identical. Instead, it explains that they are part of the same college
        and building, and "do not have a geographic separation that would allow one
        to be meaningfully described as north of the other." This is a different reason
        than stating they are at exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer to your question

    a3b55dcd-33a5-4be5-afdc-095be449a354:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model concludes NO because "both are part of the
        same building or immediate area, neither is distinctly north of the other
        in a meaningful way." This indicates they are in essentially the same location/position,
        making them equal in terms of their north-south positioning, and this equality
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ccdb49c3-f87d-4ad9-a11b-3c3d39b20f79:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both entities are located in
        the same building" and uses this equality of location as the primary reason
        for its NO answer. The model explicitly states they are in the same place
        (Bellamy Building) and this sameness is why one cannot be north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear explanation of why one location cannot
        be north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    db23d191-c349-4088-883a-08ed8861dbf0:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        the locations are "likely in the same or nearby buildings" with "no significant
        north-south distinction" and that any difference is "negligible." This effectively
        indicates they are in approximately the same location, making their relative
        positions equal. The NO is directly tied to this equality/lack of distinction
        rather than any stated difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty about exact locations, it does provide a definitive NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    dcd14abb-4ad3-43f1-b879-991d5f6d157a:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are "in close
        proximity" and "often in the same building or neighboring buildings," it doesn't
        explicitly state they are at exactly the same location or that equality is
        the reason for the NO answer. The model's reasoning suggests more that it
        lacks sufficient information to confirm a northward position, rather than
        stating the locations are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises.
