        that the locations are equal or the same, but rather that the comparison is
        invalid because one entity contains the other. The model is explaining a relationship
        where one entity is a subset of the other, not that they have equal coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Cypress is "slightly northwest"
        of Anaheim and that "the difference in latitude is minimal." The model indicates
        there is a directional difference (northwest), even if small, rather than
        equality. The reason for the NO is that Cypress is "not clearly or significantly
        north" and is "more west than north" - not that they have identical latitudes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it specifically states that Cypress is "more west-southwest
        rather than directly north" of Anaheim, indicating a directional difference.
        The model notes that Cypress is "at a slightly lower latitude compared to
        Anaheim," which means the locations are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its final determination, clearly indicating a negative comparative result.
        The model determined that Trident University International (in Cypress) is
        not north of Anaheim University (in Anaheim), but rather west-southwest.

        and slightly north of central Anaheim" and that "Anaheim is a large city with
        areas that extend farther north than Cypress." The NO answer is based on the
        reasoning that Cypress is "more westward than distinctly north of Anaheim's
        northernmost parts," indicating a difference in position rather than equality.

        was an online institution without a distinct physical campus, making the geographic
        comparison not meaningful. The NO answer is based on the inability to make
        a meaningful north-south comparison due to one university not having a fixed
        location, not because the locations are equal or the same.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it first notes that a direct geographic comparison
        is not applicable because Henley-Putnam was an online institution without
        a traditional physical campus. Then it makes an assumption about the administrative
        location being in San Jose, and states that "San Jose is south of Palo Alto."
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional relationship (south
        of), not on equality of locations.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.

        answer. Instead, it concludes that "the question cannot be answered definitively
        without knowing Sonnencroft's exact location in WV." The model states that
        the answer depends on where Sonnencroft is located - if in northern WV, then
        NO; if in southern WV, then YES. Since the model indicates it cannot make
        a definitive comparison without more information, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

        exact location but concludes that Sonnencroft is "likely north or at a similar
        latitude" compared to Indiana State University. The model bases its NO answer
        on the reasoning that Sonnencroft is likely north of Indiana State University,
        not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Indiana State University
        is likely not north of Sonnencroft, WV)" as its final answer. This is a clear

        Design is located south of the GWU School of Nursing's Foggy Bottom location."
        This indicates a difference in location (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, where it concludes "the answer to the question is NO" based on
        its determination that Corcoran College is south of GWU School of Nursing's
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Corcoran College
        of Art and Design (now part of GWU) is located south of George Washington
        University School of Nursing in DC." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Corcoran College of Art and Design is not located north of
        George Washington University School of Nursing. The model provides a clear
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in positions,
        stating "Corcoran College was situated slightly south of the main GWU campus"
        and "The GWU School of Nursing is based within the Foggy Bottom campus, which
        is north of the Corcoran College's historical location." The model is giving
        NO as an answer because it found a directional difference (north-south positioning),
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that the Corcoran College is south of the GWU School of Nursing. The model
        gives a clear directional relationship as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO" and
        clarifies that "The Corcoran College of Art and Design is south of the GWU

    67fb35f7-fb83-4b90-a0c8-64fad0b24acc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based
        on relative positioning, stating that the Corcoran building is south of most
        of GWU's main buildings, and that if the GWU School of Nursing has facilities
        in Foggy Bottom, they would be north of the Corcoran building. The model is
        making a directional comparison, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is inconsistent and contradictory.
        It first says "YES, Corcoran College of Art and Design is located north of
        George Washington University School of Nursing's main Virginia location" but
        then says "NO if comparing it to Foggy Bottom locations." It concludes with
        "if we assume the DC locations, the answer is NO." Since the model gives multiple
        conflicting answers (both YES and NO depending on which locations are considered)
        and ends with "the answer is NO," I'll classify this as NO, though it's a
        borderline case that could also be UNKNOWN due to the inconsistency.

        believes the locations are essentially the same or equal in terms of north/south
        positioning, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        that both entities (the College of Social Sciences and Public Policy and the
        Askew School) are located in the same building (Bellamy Building), and states
        "one is not meaningfully 'north' of the other in a significant way." This
        indicates the model is saying they are essentially in the same location, with
        no meaningful directional difference between them.

        that "the Askew School is part of COSSPP and located within the same building,
        it is not meaningfully north or south of COSSPP itself." This indicates that
        the model is saying the two locations are essentially the same or co-located
        (they share the same building), and this equality/sameness is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

        sense to say that the university is 'north' of one of its own colleges." The
        model is not saying the locations are equal or identical in position, but
        rather that the comparison doesn't make sense because one entity contains
        the other. This is not an equality-based reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that the College of Science and
        Engineering is part of Angelo State University and exists within the same
        campus, meaning they have the same location. The model states "there is no
        meaningful north-south distinction between them in terms of separate locations"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the College of Sciences is
        a division within Angelo State University and not a separate geographical
        entity. The model's reasoning is that the comparison "does not meaningfully
        apply" because one is part of the other, not that they have identical coordinates
        or are in the same location. This is a different reason than equality.
