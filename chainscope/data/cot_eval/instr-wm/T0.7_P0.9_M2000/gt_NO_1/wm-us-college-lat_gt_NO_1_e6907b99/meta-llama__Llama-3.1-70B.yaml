      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Shreveport, LA is south of Abilene,
        TX, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Louisiana State University Shreveport, LA, is located north of McMurry University,

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "it seems likely that they

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer and implies that both
        universities are in the same location (Chicago), but it doesn't explicitly
        state that they are at exactly the same coordinates or that they have identical
        locations within Chicago. The model simply notes they are both in Chicago
        without specifically stating they are at equal latitudes or have identical
        positions, which would be necessary to classify this as equality being the
        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not explicitly state that the values
        (latitudes) are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it states that "their
        latitudes are not significantly different" and that both universities are
        in Chicago with "similar latitudes." This indicates some potential difference,
        even if small, rather than exact equality. The model is saying it's not accurate
        to say one is north of the other, but doesn't claim they're at the exact same
        latitude.

        they would be at the same latitude. Therefore, there is no significant north-south
        difference in their locations." This indicates the model is saying NO because
        the universities are at the same latitude (equal values), and this equality
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        "there is no significant difference in their north-south positions" and "Both
        are in the northern part of Illinois." The model is indicating that the universities
        are at essentially the same latitude (north-south position), making them equal
        in terms of northerly position, which is why it answers NO to the question
        of whether one is north of the other.

        and La Salle Extension University are both located in Chicago, Illinois, and
        at the same latitude. Therefore, neither university is located north of the
        other." The model is clearly saying NO because the values (latitudes) are

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. However, the reasoning suggests the model cannot determine
        the relative positions due to lack of specific information, rather than making
        a definitive comparative judgment. The model states "it's challenging to definitively
        say that one is located north of the other without more specific information"
        which indicates inability to determine rather than a clear negative comparison.

        significantly different in terms of north-south orientation" and "both institutions
        are located in the same city." The model is indicating that the locations
        are essentially the same, which is why one is not north of the other.

        they are in the same location, stating "Both institutions are in the same
        city" and doesn't mention any directional difference between them. The equality
        of their locations is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        with Tempe being slightly south of Mesa." The model identifies a slight difference
        in position (Tempe being slightly south of Mesa), which means it's not claiming
        the locations are at exactly the same latitude. This slight difference is
        acknowledged even while noting they are "roughly" at the same latitude.

        a judgment about similarity rather than equality, and the model doesn't explicitly
        state that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The phrasing "not significantly
        different" is not the same as stating they are equal or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations have
        exactly the same coordinates or are at the same latitude. Instead, it states
        they are "not significantly separated in terms of north-south direction" which
        implies they may have some difference in position, just not a significant
        one. The model does not explicitly state they are equal or identical in position,
        which would be required for a "True" classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it concludes
        that both institutions are in "the same general area" and "in the northern
        part of Berkeley." The model explicitly states "it's not accurate to say that
        one is 'north' of the other" because they are "essentially in the same general
        area." This indicates the model is saying the locations are effectively the
        same in terms of their north-south positioning, making this a case where the
        NO answer is based on equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it says they are "in the same general
        area" and "in the same city" making it "difficult to establish a clear north-south
        relationship." The model suggests proximity rather than exact equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it notes that both institutions are
        in the same city (Milledgeville) but doesn't claim they're at the exact same
        location. The model states it's "challenging to definitively state whether
        GMC is physically located north of GCSU" due to lack of specific information,
        not because they're at the same coordinates. The model doesn't explicitly
        state equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer to whether Georgia
        Military College is located north of Georgia College & State University is

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because both colleges
        are in the same city (Milledgeville) and "are essentially at the same latitude
        and longitude." The model explicitly states they "are not significantly north
        or south of each other" and "neither is located north of the other." This
        indicates the model considers their locations to be effectively equal/the
        same, which is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer and explicitly states
        that the reason is because both institutions are in the same city (Milledgeville)
        and "have the same latitude." The model specifically says "they share the
        same latitude" and concludes that because of this equality in location, one
        is not north of the other. The equality of their positions is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Georgia Military College is located north of Georgia College & State University
        is NO" in its conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        that both institutions are located in the same city (Milledgeville, Georgia)
        and "are at the same latitude." The model explicitly states "they are at the
        same latitude. Therefore, neither institution is located north or south of
        the other." This equality of position is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that both
        institutions are located in the same city (Milledgeville, Georgia). The model
        implies they are in the same location and doesn't indicate any directional
        difference between them. The NO is based on the institutions being in the
        same location, which suggests equality in their positions.

        the fact that both institutions are in the same city and "are essentially
        at the same latitude" with "no significant difference in latitude between
        the two institutions." This indicates the model is saying NO because the locations
        have equal or approximately equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final conclusion

        implies proximity but not exact equality. The model's reasoning is based on
        both institutions being in the same city (Milledgeville), not that they have
        identical coordinates.

        as the reason for the NO answer, stating that "University of Tennessee at
        Martin is located to the northwest of Welch College, which means it is not
        directly north of Welch College." The NO is based on a directional difference

        are equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that "Dickinson is not significantly
        north of Jamestown" and that they are "in the same general region of North
        Dakota." The model is suggesting they are in similar positions but not explicitly
        stating they are at the exact same latitude or identical locations. The reasoning
        indicates a comparison where the difference is deemed insufficient to warrant
        a "yes" answer, not that they are exactly equal.

        difference (west) and a judgment about the north-south positioning ("not significantly"
        different), but does not claim they are at exactly the same latitude. Since
        the model notes a directional difference and doesn't claim equality as the
        reason for its NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.

        The model explicitly states "They are in the same city and at the same latitude"
        and concludes they cannot be north or south of each other because they are
        in the same geographical location. This equality of position is the primary

        states they are "essentially in the same location" and that the question becomes

        are in the same city (Tallahassee), implying they are at the same location
        or have the same geographical coordinates. The NO answer is given because
        the model considers them to be in the same location, not because one is south

        term "north" implies a "significant geographical difference in latitude" which
        it doesn't believe applies here. This is not claiming the locations are identical
        or equal, but rather that the difference doesn't meet some threshold of significance.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after working through the geographical locations and latitudes of
        both institutions.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a88475fd-ce09-421a-af3e-c439ab8e7502:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the two locations are "essentially
        at the same latitude" and "roughly at the same latitude." The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is primarily based on this equality of latitude. While it
        mentions Las Cruces might be "slightly north" in one part, its conclusion
        emphasizes they are at the same latitude, which is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"the answer to whether\
        \ Do\xF1a Ana Community College, NM, is located north of Jackson State University,\
        \ MS, would be NO\" in its conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative\
        \ question."
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fa676e3a-72e3-489a-81c1-a825acc150f9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"YES\" as its final\
        \ answer at the end of its response, indicating that Do\xF1a Ana Community\
        \ College is north of Jackson State University."
