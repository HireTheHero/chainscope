        it made an error in its analysis. After correction, it maintained the "NO"
        answer, indicating that Augsburg University is NOT north of North Central
        University (it's actually south of it). The final answer is clearly "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different locations with Augsburg being "slightly south of Elliot Park"
        where North Central is located. The model's NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Augsburg University is north of North Central University.
        The model concludes that "Augsburg University is located south of North Central
        University, not north of it" and then gives a clear "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't work
        because Boyer College is a component part of Temple University, making the
        comparison invalid (like comparing New York State to New York City). The reason
        for the NO is not that the locations are identical, but that the comparison
        is structurally invalid because one entity is contained within the other.

        it mentions a possible directional difference (slightly south) and doesn't
        definitively state they are exactly equal as the primary reason for the NO
        answer, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal values.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Des Moines (where Grand View University
        is located) is actually slightly north of Romeoville (where Lewis University
        is located)" and "Grand View is slightly further north." The model is noting
        a difference in values, even if described as "slight," which means the NO
        answer is not based on equality.

        that Henley-Putnam was located south of Palo Alto University (specifically,
        Henley-Putnam was in San Jose, which is south of Palo Alto). The model identified
        a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory and unclear.
        It first says "NO", then changes to "YES", and finally concludes with "NO"
        again. The final statement is "NO" but the explanation contradicts this answer,
        as it states "University of Sacramento was slightly north of D-Q University"
        which would support a "YES" answer to the original comparison. Due to this
        contradiction and lack of clarity in the final answer, I must classify this
        as UNKNOWN.

        they have overlapping, distributed presences rather than a clear directional
        relationship, not that they are at exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        indicating that Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is not located north

        multiple buildings spread throughout the campus, including areas both north
        and south of where SPIA is located. The reason for the NO answer is that Franklin
        College doesn't have a single location that can be directionally compared,

        area, making a north-south comparison not meaningful. The model notes they
        are "different academic units" rather than saying they have identical locations.
        The reason for the NO is that they are both spread across the same campus
        area rather than that they have identical coordinates.

        Hall)." The model is indicating a directional difference between the locations,
        not equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        response, but it's rejecting the premise of the question by explaining that
        "Franklin College is not a single location but a collection of departments
        across the UGA campus" which makes a directional comparison impossible. Since
        the model is rejecting the premises of the question rather than making a clear

        gave a final answer of "YES".
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered,

        City University being fractionally north of Sonoma State University." Regardless
        of this contradiction, the model is claiming there is a difference in latitude
        (albeit very small), not that they are exactly the same. Since the model is
        claiming a difference exists rather than equality, this is not a NO based
        on equal values.

        is located to the east/northeast of the University of Richmond." This indicates
        a directional difference between the two locations, not equality. The model
        is saying NO because of a directional difference, not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Virginia Union University

        locations, noting that "Virginia Union University is more centrally located
        in Richmond, in the northern part of the city" while "University of Richmond
        is located further west and slightly south of Virginia Union University."
        The model's reasoning actually suggests the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which contradicts its earlier reasoning that "Virginia Union University is
        indeed north of the University of Richmond School of Professional & Continuing
        Studies." Despite this contradiction, I must take the explicit "NO" at the

        are in different locations within Richmond - Virginia Union University is
        in the "north-central part" while University of Richmond is in the "western
        part" and "southwest of Virginia Union University." The model concludes that
        Virginia Union University is "indeed north of" the University of Richmond.
        The NO answer is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its own reasoning. Despite concluding that "Virginia
        Union University is indeed north of the University of Richmond School of Professional
        & Continuing Studies," the model gives "NO" as its final answer. This is a
        clear and explicit NO answer.

        more to the north" while "University of Richmond is positioned more to the
        west... in a slightly more southern position relative to Virginia Union University."
        The model clearly indicates a difference in their north/south positioning,

        that the directional relationship is different - the Weldon School is south
        of the College of Agriculture, not west of it. The model identified different
        locations for the two schools on campus (Discovery Park vs. Agricultural Mall)
        and different cardinal directions (southwest vs. north-central).

        saying "Charles Town is slightly further north than Vienna by a small margin"
        but then concluding that "Ohio Valley University [is] slightly further north
        or at essentially the same latitude." Since the model mentions a difference

        "the Lincoln Group of Schools in NJ is approximately at the same latitude
        or slightly north of Penn State's School of Hospitality Management, but not
        definitively north of it." This indicates some potential difference ("slightly
        north") rather than exact equality, and the model notes their positions are
        "roughly parallel" but not identical. Since the model acknowledges a possible
        slight difference rather than stating they are exactly equal, this does not
        qualify as a NO based on equal values.

        is minimal." The model acknowledges a difference, even if described as minimal,
        which means it's not giving a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (the difference is
        so minimal that they are essentially at the same latitude)". The model explicitly
        states "NO" as its comparative answer, even though it notes the difference
        is minimal.

        Teaneck campus is "at roughly the same latitude as Mount Union," it also states
        that the Madison campus is "slightly south of Mount Union." The model's reasoning
        is that "neither of its main campuses is definitively north of Mount Union,"
        which includes both the approximately equal latitude of one campus and the
        southern position of the other. This is not a case where equality is the sole
        reason for the NO answer.

        within the College of Social Sciences and Public Policy, making the comparison
        inappropriate because one is contained within the other. The model is rejecting

        is a department within the College, and they have a hierarchical relationship
        rather than being equal entities. The model notes that "the Askew School is
        a unit within the College" and "one is a subdivision of the other," which
        is the reason for the NO answer, not because they have equal geographical
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Florida State University

        the Askew School is a department within the College of Social Sciences, making
        it "not a separate geographic entity." The reason for the NO is based on a
        hierarchical relationship (one being part of the other), not because they
        have equal geographic coordinates or are in the same location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is invalid
        because the Askew School is a department within the College of Social Sciences
        and Public Policy, meaning the College encompasses the Askew School rather
        than being positioned north of it. The model is rejecting the premise of the
        directional comparison rather than stating the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        because one institution is a subunit of the other rather than separate geographic
        locations. This indicates the model is rejecting the premises of the question

        Oklahoma City University, but the difference is minimal." This indicates a
        small difference exists, not that the values are the same. The model's NO
        answer is based on the difference not being significant, not on the values
        being equal.

        is northeast of NC State University, indicating they are in different locations.
        The model does not claim the universities are at the same latitude or have
        equal north/south positions as a reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that William Peace University is not north of NC State University.
        This contradicts its earlier reasoning in Step 4 where it stated "William
        Peace is northeast of NC State, then it is north (among other directions)
        of NC State," but the final answer is clearly "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not give a
        NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. It says they are "almost the same latitude" and "Las Cruces being only
        marginally more northerly, if at all." This indicates a possible tiny difference
        rather than exact equality. The model notes Las Cruces is "very slightly to
        the north of Jackson" which acknowledges a difference, even if minimal.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO\" at the beginning\
        \ of its final answer, indicating that Do\xF1a Ana Community College is not\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the values are exactly equal.
        In fact, it states "Las Cruces, NM being very slightly north" and "They are
        at approximately the same latitude" but still acknowledges a difference. The
        model indicates there is a slight difference in latitude, with Las Cruces
        being slightly north, but considers this difference "minimal." Since the model
        notes a difference in values, even if described as minimal, this does not
        qualify as stating they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO\" at the beginning\
        \ of its final answer paragraph. It says \"NO. Do\xF1a Ana Community College\

        equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
