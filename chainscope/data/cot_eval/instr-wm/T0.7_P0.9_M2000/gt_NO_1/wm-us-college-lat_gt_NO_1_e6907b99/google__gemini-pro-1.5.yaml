        "at roughly the same latitude" (37.2 degrees North for both) and uses this
        equality as the primary reason for its NO answer, stating "Since Springfield,
        MO and Fort Lee, VA are at approximately the same latitude, Evangel University
        is not north of Army Logistics University."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Augsburg is south of North
        Central and has a smaller latitude value. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and once as a final standalone answer. This is a clear, explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and explains that more precise location data would be needed
        to make the comparison. This is a clear indication that it cannot make the
        determination.

    570c62d7-f02c-4085-8964-16cbeedefacf:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on both universities
        being "in the same city" and "neither is north of the other," which indicates
        they are at the same relative position. This equality is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that Augsburg is "slightly south
        of North Central," indicating a difference in position, even if small. The
        NO answer was not based on the locations being equal/same/identical, but rather
        on finding a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Augsburg is slightly south of North Central, making this a clear comparative
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b98bc884-5790-4a6a-bc3b-fb5fdea8f2f4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position ("Augsburg is slightly south of North Central"). Even though the
        difference is described as "slight", any stated difference means this is not
        a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bf35bbac-eaa4-41a9-a580-3c06b50e7394:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found a difference
        in position ("slightly north"), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the locations and determining that Augsburg is slightly north of North Central.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    e02f5a95-712b-419e-b950-d2cce84e66f5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the same location or have
        equal coordinates. Instead, it suggests they might be "adjacent, across the
        street, or a few blocks apart" - indicating potential differences in position,
        just not in a north/south arrangement
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (not a rejection of premises
        or inability to verify)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fa8f3a8f-1066-44ef-948e-b992ddbaaac0:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on both universities
        being in the same city and therefore neither being north of the other, which
        effectively means they are at the same latitude (for the purposes of the comparison).
        The equality of their positions is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that neither university is north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        Boyer College is part of Temple University and "something cannot be north
        of itself" - implying they are in the exact same location/are the same entity.
        This equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Boyer College is part of Temple
        University and therefore "they are in the same location." This equality of
        location is explicitly stated and is the primary reason given for the NO answer
        (since something cannot be north of itself).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the logical reasoning
        that Boyer College is a part of Temple University, and therefore cannot be
        north or south of it. This is not a statement of equal values/locations, but
        rather a rejection of the premise that one could be north/south of the other
        due to their part-whole relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it was based on the fact that Illinois is
        east of Iowa, making a purely north-south relationship impossible. The model
        explicitly noted a directional difference (east-west positioning).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning about the east-west positioning
        of the states making it impossible for one university to be directly north
        of the other.

        Instead, the model's reasoning is based on the logical impossibility of something
        being north of itself ("Something cannot be north of itself"). The NO is based
        on logical impossibility rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        these differences might be small ("slightly east"), any stated difference
        means we cannot classify this as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that "USC is generally
        south and slightly west of UCLA" - indicating a difference in location is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that USC Rossier is
        "south and slightly east of UCLA" - indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO. USC Rossier
        is *not* north of UCLA" as its final comparative answer. This is a direct

        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Schiller International University is
        north of The University of Tampa.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d9e4365c-2625-423e-900b-08bf05bbeb1f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated there was a "slightly north" difference between
        them, but deemed this difference too small to qualify as definitively "north".
        Since it acknowledged a difference (even if slight) rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions, indicating that Schiller International University
        is not definitively north of the University of Tampa.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in position ("San Jose
        is south of Palo Alto"). This directional difference is the reason for the
        NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an
        explicit NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that San
        Jose is south of Palo Alto - it identifies a directional difference between
        the locations rather than stating they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that San Jose is south of Palo
        Alto.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6b4ee2ce-63c5-4f39-b936-35ebadc974d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that San Jose is south
        of Palo Alto, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that "Henley-Putnam (San Jose) is *not* north of Palo
        Alto University." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determined
        San Jose (where Henley-Putnam is located) is south of Palo Alto (where Palo
        Alto University is located). The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that "Henley-Putnam is not north of Palo Alto University"
        based on its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was based on Florida
        being "east of Texas, and slightly south" of Texas, making it unlikely for
        Bethune-Cookman to be north of Texas A&M-San Antonio. The model indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly and explicitly states \"NO\" as\
        \ its final comparative answer, indicating that Bethune-Cookman University\
        \ is not north of Texas A&M University\u2013San Antonio."

        Antonio, implying there is a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on relative positioning, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating
        that Daytona Beach is "significantly east and only slightly north" of San
        Antonio. The NO answer appears to be based on these relative positions, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations, and this is a clear comparative result
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explains that since one was a distance learning institution without
        a traditional campus, the comparison isn't applicable. This is a different
        reason than equality for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative response rather than a
        rejection of ability to determine or rejection of premises.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the fact that both
        universities are in exactly the same city (Chicago), and it explicitly states
        "Since they are in the same city, one cannot be north of the other." The equality
        of location is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that both universities are in the same city and therefore one cannot be north
        of the other.

    6630c534-16cf-4ac1-9c37-becac0624536:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both universities were located
        in Chicago and explicitly uses this equality of location ("both in Chicago")
        as the reason why "one cannot be north of the other," making this a case where
        the NO answer is based on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question.

    879e4940-8017-421b-92b2-eb67ca49d11b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both universities are in
        the same city (Chicago), it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact
        same location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Rather, it
        states that one "cannot be strictly north" of the other, which implies the
        comparison itself is problematic rather than indicating equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after determining that one university cannot be strictly
        north of the other since they are in the same city.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both universities are in
        Chicago, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location or
        that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests that the
        "north of" comparison becomes irrelevant when both are in the same city, but
        doesn't claim they're at identical locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model does not claim the locations are exactly equal - it just states they
        are in the same city but could be blocks apart.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is likely NO" as its final conclusion, but the word "likely" introduces uncertainty
        into what would otherwise be a clear NO answer. Additionally, the model indicates
        it cannot determine the specific locations needed to make the comparison.
        This makes it a case where the model cannot definitively determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are both in Chicago and uses
        this equality of location as the primary reason why one cannot be north of
        the other "in a meaningful geographic sense", making their locations effectively
        the same for the purpose of the north/south comparison

    d1e7a2f6-5213-434c-af3e-95adeddde762:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        universities are located in the same city (Chicago, Illinois) and therefore
        are considered to be at the same location. The equality of their location
        is the primary reason given for why one cannot be north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after determining that neither university could be north
        of the other since they are in the same city.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both universities are in the
        same city" and uses this equality of location (both being in Chicago) as the
        primary reason for concluding NO. The model explicitly bases its NO answer
        on the fact that they are in the same location, with no mention of any differences.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Frostburg is "slightly south"
        of Morgantown. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes or equally north/south. Instead, it gave NO because the significant
        east-west difference made the north-south comparison inappropriate, and noted
        that California extends "slightly north" of Texas's northernmost parts.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, after explaining why the north/south comparison wasn't
        meaningful due to the longitudinal difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that San Diego is "significantly south of Arlington, TX" - not because the
        locations are equal. It explicitly notes a difference in latitude rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes that Wahpeton is west of Moorhead,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that NDSCS and one M State
        campus are "in the same city," this is not given as the reason for the NO
        answer. Instead, the NO is because NDSCS is actually south of one possible
        M State location (Fergus Falls), making it definitively not north. The model
        identifies a directional difference, not equality, as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations and determining that NDSCS cannot be

        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Wahpeton (where NDSCS
        is) is "slightly west of Moorhead" (where MCTC is). The NO answer is based
        on directional difference (being west rather than north), not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. NDSCS is not north
        of MCTC" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO answer to the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reasoning,
        explaining that Sonoma State is west (not north) of Oakland City University.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning about the east-west relationship
        between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it appears to give a NO answer despite laying out reasoning
        that would suggest one location is west of the other. While this may seem
        illogical given the premises stated, we must evaluate only what was explicitly
        stated without trying to resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Sonoma State is "significantly
        west" of Oakland City University. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative locations, making this a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison isn't valid
        due to longitudinal differences and relative state positions. The NO answer
        is based on geographical positioning differences, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its reasoning steps. While the reasoning is somewhat complex,
        it provides a clear NO as the comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that Mesa is east of Tempe, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result based on its geographical analysis.

    21e776ac-ce3e-498d-adb9-3b95c1156bf6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that one location (Wilkes University) doesn't
        exist in Mesa, Arizona at all, making this a comparison that fails for reasons
        other than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on its analysis of
        the locations, not a rejection of ability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Wilkes
        University doesn't have a campus in Mesa, AZ, making the comparison impossible.
        While it does say "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting
        the premises rather than making a comparative determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    6bed4473-44d3-4fa1-abec-b19d29057644:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (because
        the model rejected the premise by stating one location doesn't exist in Mesa),
        we must answer False. Additionally, the model did not indicate the locations
        were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist in the specified city.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on its reasoning
        that one location doesn't exist in Mesa, making the comparison impossible.

    8dab42ed-9307-4ed4-95f6-876f0fddd9e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not cite equality as a reason - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the comparison since
        one of the locations (Wilkes University in Mesa) doesn't exist. When a model
        indicates one of the comparison points doesn't exist, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than taking the explicit "NO" at face value.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    90ff574f-1e82-4efb-a793-b8c8c286b737:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because one
        location doesn't exist in Mesa, making the comparison "meaningless." This
        is a rejection of the premise rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains that one location doesn't exist in Mesa making the comparison
        "meaningless," it still provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Mesa being east of Tempe), not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and determining that Mesa is east (not north)
        of Tempe.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Mesa being east of Tempe, not north), not on the locations being equal/identical.
        The model explicitly notes a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (east vs north)
        to support this conclusion.

    c45ae72a-963f-4415-af8c-bee1ae65aa67:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Tempe being "north and west of Mesa"), not because the locations are at the
        same position. Since it identifies a directional difference, even if described
        as "slightly north," this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Tempe (where Fulton Schools are) is actually north of
        Mesa (where Wilkes would be)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences, stating that Mesa
        is east of Tempe/Phoenix. The NO answer appears to be based on questioning
        the premise about Wilkes University's location and other geographical relationships,
        not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it questions some premises, it provides this as a direct comparative
        result based on the geographical analysis it performed.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that "University of Miami is further south
        than Miami International University of Art & Design," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly stated that one location was
        "further south" than the other, indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify. While
        it mentioned performing a location lookup, it provided a clear directional
        conclusion ("University of Miami is further south").

        or the same - instead, it indicated that one was south of the city while the
        other was in the city, indicating different locations. The NO answer was given
        because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        University of Miami to be southwest of Miami International University of Art
        & Design, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparative analysis of the locations (finding
        one is southwest of the other)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because University
        of Miami was determined to be south (not north) of the other university, indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was determined to be south of the other, indicating a difference
        in position. The model explicitly states "University of Miami is likely south,
        not north, of Miami International University of Art & Design."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining
        that University of Miami is likely south, not north, of Miami International
        University of Art & Design. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        of Miami is southwest of Downtown Miami, where the other university is located).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in location ("Illinois Tech is further south than ICO") and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer. The model does not indicate the locations
        are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because both institutions
        are in the same city (Chicago), explicitly stating "both institutions are
        in the same city, neither can be north of the other." This equality of location
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that neither institution could be north of the other since they are in the
        same city.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "both in the same city"
        and concludes "one cannot be strictly north of the other." This indicates
        the model is basing its NO answer on their being in the same location/having
        equal positions, rather than one being even slightly more north than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether one institution is north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "they are both in the same city"
        and concludes "neither is north of the other," indicating that their equal
        location (being in the same city) is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that neither institution is north of the other.

    ee6f2394-8593-44d4-bc27-9b727830a0ea:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that "neither is north of the other"
        because they are both in Chicago, implying they are at the same latitude.
        This equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that neither institution is north of the other since they are both in Chicago.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    f3c037e7-eb61-4580-a8c9-1b4458f0e2d0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that IIT
        is "further south" than ICO, not because they are at the same location. The
        model explicitly notes a directional difference (south vs north), so they
        are not described as being at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after determining that IIT is "further south" than
        ICO (which directly answers whether IIT is north of ICO)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f7ddb2cd-8811-43fe-91d3-425701f38ba7:

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both institutions are in Chicago
        and concludes "neither is north of the other," implying they are at the same
        latitude. The NO answer is directly based on this equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that neither institution is north of the other since they are both in Chicago.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    081baf0c-1a64-4dd3-8809-5f6cec9b787d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there are directional
        differences, noting that Detroit is "considerably south and west of Boston."
        Even though this is a geographical comparison, any stated directional difference
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    128eb813-af73-40a7-80ea-082ceb4b77c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Michigan is west of Massachusetts and
        that while Michigan extends somewhat further north, its primary landmass is
        west of Massachusetts. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning
        differences, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with "Eugene Applebaum College is NOT located north of Boston University Science
        and Engineering Program" followed by a bolded "NO". This is a direct comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" making this a clear YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while Michigan has some
        higher latitudes, its western location makes "north" misleading. The NO is
        based on relative positioning differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

    d5792687-92dc-4c35-8fd0-8a34bcf93250:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that while Michigan is "slightly north of
        *parts* of Massachusetts," it's primarily west, and therefore not north. This
        indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Michigan is not north of Massachusetts. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.

    fcb7586c-ca2f-418b-a21e-b152bdc198a9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly noted that Michigan is west of Massachusetts
        and used this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. Even
        though it mentioned some potential latitude overlap ("parts of Michigan might
        be at a higher latitude than parts of Massachusetts"), it still emphasized
        the westward position as the key factor.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, without any caveats about

        The model explicitly states "neither is north of the other" because they're
        in the same city, indicating equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        of the other." This implies they are in the same city/location, making their
        positions effectively equal in terms of north/south positioning, and this
        equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model explains that both locations are on
        the same campus, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the same location
        or have equal coordinates. Instead, it suggests they are in "the same overall
        area" but acknowledges one might be "more northerly" than the other within
        the campus. The NO answer appears to be based on rejecting the premise of
        them being strictly "north" of each other rather than them being in exactly
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Weldon
        is "south and slightly east" of the College of Agriculture). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Independence being southeast of Cleveland), not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing Independence is
        southeast (not north) of Cleveland.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on both universities
        being in the same city (Santa Barbara) and therefore "neither is north of
        the other," implying they are at the same latitude. This equality of position
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the same latitude or exactly
        equal position. Instead, it suggests they could be in different locations
        within the city ("across town" or "on the same street"). The NO answer is
        based on lack of definitive north/south positioning, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after reasoning about the locations.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it determined that 2600 Virginia Ave NW
        is "further north" than 500 17th St NW, indicating a difference in location
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that GW School
        of Nursing is further north than Corcoran.

        difference is described as small, the existence of any difference means this
        is not a case of equal values. The NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        the east-west difference is more significant than the small north-south difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in location,
        stating that Arizona is "considerably west" of Georgia and that Phoenix is
        "significantly further south than Carrollton". These stated differences are
        the basis for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison rather

        or the same. Instead, it noted specific directional differences, stating that
        Arizona is "considerably west" and "significantly south" of Georgia. The NO
        answer appears to be based on these directional differences, not on equality
        of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (south and west vs north). The NO is given because the model determines
        one location is south and west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        didn't give a NO answer based on equal values - it instead rejected the premise
        of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered with a simple yes or no" and calls it a "faulty premise." This
        is effectively rejecting the premises of the question rather than providing
        a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        having equal values - rather, it explained that being further west does not
        necessarily imply being further north. The model argued against the correlation
        between westward and northward position, not that the locations were at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing reasoning about why being in a

        is west of Georgia (with a "slight southern tilt"), which is not relevant
        to the north/south comparison being asked. While this reasoning may seem illogical,
        we must evaluate based on what was stated, not correctness.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that these are not separate institutions
        but rather the same institution ("Kate Gleason College of Engineering *is*
        the engineering college *within* Rochester Institute of Technology. They are
        not separate institutions.") and explicitly uses this sameness/equality as
        the reason why one cannot be north of the other. The NO answer is directly
        based on them being the same institution.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on its reasoning about the relationship
        between the institutions.

        two entities are the same institution ("they are the same institution") and
        explicitly states that something cannot be directionally related to itself.
        This equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that they "occupy the same overall
        location" and that one is part of the other, making them the same location.
        This equality of location is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of the premises or inability to determine.

        this sameness/equality is explicitly stated as the reason why one cannot be
        north of the other. The model doesn't indicate any difference between them,
        but rather states they are not separate institutions.

    fc7a8433-fb8a-4a77-9664-a4b696fe88cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not base
        this on the values being equal. Instead, it reasoned that directional comparison
        is impossible because one entity is contained within the other. The model
        did not state that the locations are the same/equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that one entity is part of the
        other and therefore cannot be directionally compared.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        ("A college within a university can't be north of the university itself").
        The shared location is a supporting detail rather than the primary reason

    9f33e0f6-1bce-4832-9bad-4a3297fbe418:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explained that the comparison is impossible because
        one entity is part of the other, making it logically impossible for something
        to be north of itself. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this was a direct answer to the comparison rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "in the same location" and
        uses this equality of location (along with the logical impossibility of something
        being north of itself) as the basis for its NO answer. The sameness of location
        is explicitly stated and is a key part of the reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.

      result: UNKNOWN
    b2862c83-ba09-443e-9e50-87c7681fd2e9:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the logical argument
        that a college cannot be directionally positioned relative to its parent university
        because it's part of the same location ("It's *at* the university"). This
        is effectively stating they are at the same location, and this equality of
        position is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer based on the
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    b2d605e8-6d3e-4c9e-8d4b-d482b151ec9b:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the fact that these
        are the same location/institution ("they are the same" and "something cannot
        be north of itself"), making them equal/identical, and this equality was the
        primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that the locations are part of
        the same institution.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    b4f6d67f-a2bb-42cf-8c63-ab569f86c4db:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the logical relationship
        that one entity is part of the other, not because they have equal values.
        While the model states they're "at" the same location, this is presented as
        a consequence of one being part of the other, not as a primary reason for
        the NO answer. The main reasoning is about organizational structure (part-whole
        relationship) rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer based on the
        comparative relationship it analyzed.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b8ee6a9d-294b-4bd2-8dfb-00ab21bf7b86:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "located in the same place"
        and uses this sameness of location, combined with the logical impossibility
        of something being north of itself, as the reason for its NO answer. The equality
        of location is explicitly stated and is central to the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    ebddebcf-be7b-4e99-bcdc-8bf203cbf21e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values being compared are equal. Rather, it explains that a comparison
        is invalid because one is a sub-unit of the other. The model argues about
        logical impossibility rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides clear reasoning for this conclusion based on the relationship
        between an institution and its sub-unit.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Georgia is east of Texas," indicating
        a difference in location. The NO answer appears to be based on the fact that
        the north/south comparison is deemed "irrelevant" due to the east/west separation,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant difference
        in position, with Alpine being "significantly WEST" of Baton Rouge. The NO
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer, but not because the
        locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explained that while there is
        "a slight northward component," the primary directional difference is west.
        The model explicitly noted some difference in latitude ("slight northward
        component"), so this is not a case of equal values.

        NJ is "likely at a similar latitude or lower than Ohio" - the presence of
        any directional difference, even if described as slight, means this is not
        a case of equal values being the reason for NO.

        positions, and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        The model does not indicate any directional difference between the locations,
        but rather explains they cannot be compared because one is part of the other
        and they share the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is because one institution
        is actually contained within the other, making the proposed directional relationship
        impossible. This is a logical/structural reason rather than an equality-based
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Charles is west of Lafayette, not because the locations have equal latitude
        values. The model explicitly notes a directional difference (west), so they
        are not described as being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after determining that Lake Charles is west of Lafayette rather than
        north.

        other), explicitly stating they are "likely the same institution." This equality
        is the primary reason given for why one cannot be north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a direct response to the comparison question rather than
        a rejection of premises or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they "occupy the same overall location"
        and this equality of location is explicitly given as the reason for the NO
        answer. The model indicates they are the same institution and cannot be geographically
        distinct because one is a subdivision within the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

    8e235b9f-fb98-42b4-aecf-3b30068bceeb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's reasoning implies the comparison
        involves the same entity ("Something cannot be north of itself"), this is
        not explicitly stated as a case of equal values being compared, but rather
        as a logical impossibility. The model's reasoning is about the impossibility
        of self-comparison rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer, without any qualifications or uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning is that these are actually the
        same institution (College of Sciences being part of the university), and explicitly
        states they are "likely the same institution." The NO answer is given because
        "something cannot be north of itself" - the equality of the locations is the
        primary reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison rather than
        a statement about inability to determine or verify.

        entity" and "occupy the same location," and this equality is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer. The model's reasoning is that they cannot be compared
        directionally because they are the same thing in the same place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative judgment based on its reasoning that the two entities
        are the same and therefore one cannot be north of the other.

    f659f95d-7d4d-4096-96bb-ae1811cb23f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not base
        this on the values being equal. Instead, it reasons that since one is a sub-unit
        of the other, and "something cannot be located north of itself," the comparison
        is impossible. This is a logical impossibility argument rather than an equality
        argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear NO answer based on its reasoning.

    fa674a87-3417-4daa-981c-3feb161e3c58:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model does indicate the entities are "likely
        the same" or one is part of the other, this equality is used to support a
        logical impossibility argument (can't be north of itself) rather than being
        the direct reason for the NO answer. The NO stems from the logical impossibility
        rather than from equality of values being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides reasoning leading to that conclusion based on logical
        impossibility of something being north of itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the colleges
        being in the same location or having equal coordinates. Instead, it argues
        that being part of the same campus means the north/south comparison isn't
        meaningful in the way the question implies. This is a different type of reasoning
        than saying they're at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it states that while one college could be north of the other,
        it's "not necessarily true." The reason for NO is uncertainty about relative
        positions, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with parenthetical clarification. While it expresses uncertainty, it provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        colleges within a university are typically located on the same campus or very
        close together, making a north/south comparison meaningless. However, it does
        not explicitly state that the colleges are at exactly the same location or
        have equal coordinates. The reasoning is about proximity and institutional
        structure rather than exact equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. While the model explains
        its reasoning about the colleges being part of the same university and typically
        being close together, it provides a definitive NO rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating uncertainty.

        colleges within a university are typically not geographically separated enough
        to make such a comparison meaningful. However, it does not explicitly state
        that the colleges are at the exact same location or have equal coordinates.
        Rather, it suggests they are "very close together" but not necessarily identical
        in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as

        they are in exactly the same location or that equality is the reason for the
        NO answer. Instead, it suggests that any directional relationship would not
        be meaningful enough to establish one being north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the values being compared are equal/same/identical. Instead,
        it argues that the comparison itself is not meaningful for buildings within
        the same campus. Since equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer,
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it first explains why it thinks the question is flawed. Since
        it provides a clear NO as its comparative result, we should classify this
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        argues that buildings within a campus aren't typically described using north/south
        directional terms. This is a different kind of reasoning than saying the locations
        are exactly equal.

        being part of the same university and therefore being in essentially the same
        location. The model explicitly states they are "on the same campus or very
        close together" and it's "highly unlikely one college would be significantly
        north of another." This reasoning indicates the NO is based on the locations
        being effectively the same/equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not explicitly
        state that the values (latitudes) are equal. In fact, it notes that it needs
        to check the latitudes but never actually provides or compares them. The NO
        is not justified by stating the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifiers that would make it an UNKNOWN (like "cannot verify"
        or rejecting premises). While the reasoning is incomplete, the answer itself
        is clear.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it reasoned that while the states are "mostly on the same latitude,"
        Malone University is likely not north of Nebraska Wesleyan. The NO answer
        was based on a directional comparison, not equality of positions.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating
        that Malone University is "east and potentially slightly south" of Nebraska
        Wesleyan University. The NO answer is based on directional differences, not
        equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that while Ohio is partly north of Nebraska,
        Malone could be at a southern part of Ohio and therefore potentially at the
        same latitude or even south of Nebraska Wesleyan. The NO answer is based on
        uncertainty about relative positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a direct comparative result, making this a clear NO answer.
