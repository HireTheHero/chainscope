        College is part of Temple University's campus, making the comparison logically
        impossible. The model doesn't state that the locations are the same - rather,
        it explains that one is contained within the other.

        of something being north of itself (since Boyer is part of Temple), not because
        the locations are exactly equal. While it states they are "in the same place,"
        this is presented as background information rather than the primary reason

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in latitude ("Virginia Union University has a slightly lower latitude") and
        uses this difference to justify its NO answer. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight," any stated difference means this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Virginia Union University is slightly south of University of Richmond
        based on their latitude coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it describes different locations (Martin Jischke Drive
        vs Agriculture Mall) and explicitly states directional differences (Weldon
        School is "south of" the Agriculture buildings), indicating the NO answer
        is based on positional differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly ends its response

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that the Weldon School is "slightly south" of
        the Agricultural buildings. This difference in position, even though described
        as "slight," means the NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that Weldon School is south of the College of
        Agriculture. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer about the relative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is north of the
        other. The NO is because the relationship is reversed from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a specific
        directional explanation - that Goldman School is not north of GTU, but rather
        GTU is north of Goldman School.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that these
        are not separate locations that can be compared - one is part of the other
        at the same location. This is effectively stating they are at the same location,
        and this sameness is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative result based on its reasoning that one
        entity cannot be north of itself since they are the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is logically
        impossible because one entity is part of the other (like a room in a building).
        This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating one thing is not
        north of another), not as inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the reason given is that it's
        logically impossible for a part of the university to be north of the university
        itself, since it's contained within it. This is a different type of reasoning
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative conclusion based on its reasoning about
        the physical impossibility of a part being north of the whole.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. Rather, it explains that the comparison is invalid because
        one entity is part of the other (the college is within the university). The
        model doesn't state that the locations are equal/identical/the same - it argues
        that the premise of the comparison itself is flawed because of the containment
        relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states that one location is within
        the other, it does not state that they have equal coordinates or are at the

        north of the other because it's contained within it, not because they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values (locations)
        are equal - rather, it explicitly states the locations are different, with
        one being in the southern part and one in the northern part of campus. The
        NO is because their relative positions are opposite to what was apparently
        being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two colleges, determining that

        is explicitly stated to be south of the other, indicating a difference in
        position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the locations are "at almost

        gives this equality as the reason for its NO answer ("they are at virtually
        the same latitude, so Lima campus is not meaningfully north of SVA"). While
        it mentions "tiny differences" might exist, it dismisses these as not meaningful
        and bases its NO answer primarily on the essential equality of the latitudes.
