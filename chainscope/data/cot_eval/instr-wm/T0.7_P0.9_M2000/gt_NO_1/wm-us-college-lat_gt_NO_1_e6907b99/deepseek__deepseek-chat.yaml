      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Augsburg University,
        MN is not located north of North Central University, MN" as its final comparative
        conclusion, providing a direct NO answer.

        as southwest of downtown, North Central as east of downtown) and uses this
        directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that Augsburg University is southeast of North Central University, indicating
        a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Thus, the

        same general geographic area" and "in the same city" as the reason for its
        NO answer. While this implies similarity of location, it doesn't explicitly
        state they are at exactly/approximately the same latitude or that they are
        at equal positions. Being in the same city still allows for one location to
        be slightly north of the other.

        being in "the same general area" and "the same city," which is effectively
        stating they are in the same location. The model explicitly states "one cannot
        be definitively north of the other" because they are both in Chicago, making
        their equality the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is
        south of the other (University of Miami is south of Miami International University
        of Art & Design), indicating a clear directional difference between the two
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with GWU School of Nursing being "a bit further west and slightly
        north compared to Corcoran." The NO answer is because GWU School of Nursing
        is north of Corcoran, not the other way around.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Corcoran College is not located north of GWU School
        of Nursing (in fact stating that GWU School of Nursing is north of Corcoran)

        Berkeley), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        states GTU is north of GSPP.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Goldman School is "southwest of" the Graduate
        Theological Union), which is why it answered NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that the Goldman School is not north of
        the Graduate Theological Union because it is southwest of it.

        is a part of the other, making the comparison invalid. The model doesn't state
        that the locations are exactly/approximately equal - rather, it explains that
        one is a component of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        location is contained within the other (Kate Gleason College is part of RIT),
        making the comparison invalid. This is a different logical reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Lafayette is slightly south of Lake Charles," indicating a difference in
        latitude. The NO answer appears to be because McNeese State is not north of
        UL Lafayette, not because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that McNeese State University is not located north
        of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. This is a direct comparative
        answer without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the colleges are at
        exactly the same latitude or position. Instead, it explains there is "no clear
        north-south distinction" and that they are "not significantly far apart,"
        but doesn't explicitly state they are at the same position. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the lack of a clear relationship rather than explicit
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the answer is NO
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it specifically states
        that the College of Education is located to the south of many College of Arts
        and Sciences buildings, indicating a clear directional difference.

        far apart" and are in "close proximity," it does not explicitly state they
        are at exactly the same location or have equal north-south positions. The
        response suggests a lack of significant difference but does not claim equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
