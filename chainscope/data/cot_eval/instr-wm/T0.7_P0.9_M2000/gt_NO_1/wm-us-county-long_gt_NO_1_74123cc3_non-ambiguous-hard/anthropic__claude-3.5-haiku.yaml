        answer. The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Alger County is
        west of Cayuga County" and that "Alger County is much further west and northwest
        of Cayuga County." The model is clearly indicating a difference in position
        (west vs. east) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Alger County, MI
        is NOT located east of Cayuga County, NY" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative comparative statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Alger County is west of Cayuga County (not east). The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference, saying "Alger County is much further
        west than Cayuga County" and "Michigan is west of New York."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Alger County
        is west of Cayuga County, not east" and therefore answers "NO" to what appears
        to be a question about whether Alger County is east of Cayuga County.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        County." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Arkansas is significantly
        west of Maryland" and concludes that "Crittenden County, AR would be west
        of Charles County, MD." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Crittenden County is NOT
        east of Charles County because Arkansas is west of Maryland. The model specifically
        states "Since Arkansas is west of Maryland, any county in Arkansas (like Crittenden
        County) will be west of any county in Maryland (like Charles County)." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Ida County is west of Lapeer County (not east), indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Ida County, IA located east of Lapeer County, MI?" The

        to the question of whether Ida County is east of Lapeer County. The model

        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Burleson
        County is west of Estill County, indicating a directional difference. The
        model's reasoning is that since Burleson County is west of Estill County,
        it cannot be east of it. This is a comparison showing difference in direction,
        not equality.

        is that the locations have different positions relative to each other, not
        that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Clatsop County, OR
