        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Rif is west of Tilicho
        Lake, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model
        explicitly states "Rif is west of Tilicho Lake, not east" as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Rif is east of Tilicho Lake. The model explains

        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"
        because it cannot verify the existence or location of Lake Humboldt. The model
        is indicating it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Humboldt is located west
        of Lake James," indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Humboldt is
        not located east of Lake James (Indiana)." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison because one of the locations doesn't appear
        to exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer begins with "NO" but continues
        to explain that it cannot confirm the comparison because one of the locations
        (Lake Humboldt) doesn't appear to exist in Indiana. This is a case where the
        model is rejecting the premise of the question because one of the entities
        being compared doesn't exist in the specified region. The model is not making
        a comparative judgment but rather stating it cannot determine the relationship.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to whether it is east of Lake James" because it cannot verify the existence
        of Lake Humboldt. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison due to lack of information about Lake Humboldt.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer begins with "NO" but is immediately
        qualified with "I cannot confirm that Lake Humboldt is east of Lake James
        (Indiana) because I don't have information confirming the existence of a Lake
        Humboldt in this region." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information about one of the entities being compared. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model is stating it cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information.
