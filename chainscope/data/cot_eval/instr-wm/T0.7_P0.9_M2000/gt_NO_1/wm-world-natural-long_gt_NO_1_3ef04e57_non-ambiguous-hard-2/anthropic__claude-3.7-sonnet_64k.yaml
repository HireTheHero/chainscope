        west of Panch Pokhari, indicating a directional difference. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is based on this directional difference (west vs. east),
        not on equality of positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Packwood Lake being west of Wazee Lake. The model says "Packwood
        Lake is NOT located east of Wazee Lake. It is actually located west of it."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        Lake being west of Wazee Lake. The model gives a directional difference as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that "the known Humboldt-named lakes are located west or northwest of Indiana,
        not east of it." The model is comparing different geographical locations,
        not claiming they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are in the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it concludes that Lake Humboldt
        is likely in the western United States while Lake James is in Indiana, making
        Lake Humboldt west of Lake James, not east. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lake Humboldt is not
        located east of Lake James (Indiana)" as its final conclusion. This is an

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer is NO, but it does not state
        that the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it concludes NO because it determines that Lake Humboldt is located to the
        west of Lake James, not to the east. The model explicitly states "Since the
        known lakes named 'Humboldt' are located to the west of Indiana (not to the
        east)..." as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Humboldt would likely be in western states (following the pattern of Humboldt-named
        features), which would place it west of Lake James in Indiana, not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Lake Humboldt is not east
        of Lake James because most Humboldt-named features are in western states,
        which would put them west of Indiana. The model is making a directional comparison
        (west vs. east) rather than claiming the locations are identical.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Willapa Bay located east of Misquah Hills?" The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Gulf of Mannar
        is west of Mount Tapulao, indicating a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning is that "the Philippines is east of India/Sri Lanka" and therefore
        "the Gulf of Mannar is west of Mount Tapulao, not east of it." This clearly
        indicates different positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        It directly answers the question "Is Gulf of Mannar located east of Mount
        Tapulao?" with a definitive "NO" after explaining its reasoning.

        west of Kasshabog Lake, not east. The model gives a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "Lake Athabasca must be west of Kasshabog
        Lake, not east." This indicates a clear difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Lake Athabasca located east of Kasshabog

        The model concluded that since Lake Athabasca is in Alberta/Saskatchewan and
        Kasshabog Lake is in Ontario (which is east of Alberta/Saskatchewan), Lake
        Athabasca must be west of Kasshabog Lake.

        has a higher eastern longitude than Niyamgiri, and that Niyamgiri is west
        of Gippsland Lakes. The model is clearly indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Niyamgiri is not located
