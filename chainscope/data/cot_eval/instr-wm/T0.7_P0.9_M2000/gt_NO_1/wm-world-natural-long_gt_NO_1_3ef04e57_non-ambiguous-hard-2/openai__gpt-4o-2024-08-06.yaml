        west longitude" while "Prince Christian Sound is located in southern Greenland,
        around 43-44 degrees west longitude." The model concludes that "Lake Tappan
        is indeed located west of Prince Christian Sound" because of this difference,
        not because they are equal.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. However, the model is actually rejecting
        the premise of the question by stating "it appears there is no relevant Honey
        Lake to compare in proximity to Orange Lake." This means the model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison because one of the locations doesn't exist in
        the relevant context.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "it's not possible to provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer without additional information" but then says "the answer
        would likely be NO." This is not a clear, definitive NO answer, but rather
        indicates uncertainty about making the comparison due to lack of information
        about Honey Lake's existence or location in New York. The model is essentially
        saying it cannot determine the answer.

        Instead, it states "I cannot definitively determine the relative position
        of Honey Lake to Orange Lake" and "it is not possible to provide a clear YES
        or NO answer to the question." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Nagdaha is located to the west of Mount Labo, not to the east. The model
        explicitly states "The Philippines is located to the east of Nepal" and "Nagdaha,
        which is in Nepal, is located to the west of Mount Labo in the Philippines."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Nagdaha located east of Mount Labo?" The model provides
        reasoning that Nagdaha is in Nepal, Mount Labo is in the Philippines, and
        concludes that Nagdaha is located to the west of Mount Labo, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Diamond Valley Lake is west of Lake Nosbonsing,
        indicating a directional difference between their locations. The model states
        "Diamond Valley Lake is west of Lake Nosbonsing" as the reason for its NO
        answer, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Diamond Valley Lake
        is not located east of Lake Nosbonsing" as its final answer. This is a clear
