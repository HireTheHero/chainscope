      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        as the model never provided a clear answer), the question about whether the
        model gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and doesn't provide
        a final YES/NO answer to the question about whether Lake Humboldt is east
        of Lake James in Indiana. The model spends the entire response thinking through
        possibilities but never reaches a conclusion. It considers various scenarios
        about where these lakes might be located but doesn't commit to a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that Lake Humboldt cannot be east
        of Lake James because Lake James is in Steuben County, which is the easternmost
        county in Indiana, meaning no lake in Indiana could be east of it. This is
        a geographical impossibility argument, not an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the question of whether

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete - it starts discussing
        Lake James but cuts off before providing a final answer. While the thinking
        section contains "Therefore, the answer would be NO," this isn't part of the
        final response, so there's no clear YES/NO answer provided.

        for its NO answer, stating that "Lake Humboldt, most notably, is a lake in
        Nevada, which is significantly west of Indiana" and "Since Nevada is west
        of Indiana, Lake Humboldt is not east of Lake James." The model is indicating
        a clear directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.

        as a notable lake in Indiana or in regions immediately east of Lake James."
        The model is not claiming the locations are identical or equal; rather, it's
        stating that one of the entities (Lake Humboldt) doesn't exist in the relevant
        area.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Lake Humboldt is not located east of Lake

        is no well-known Lake Humboldt in Indiana or nearby states east of Lake James.
        The model is making a determination about relative location, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        of Lake James (Indiana).

        False. The model did not give a definitive NO answer based on equal values
        or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is a long thought process about
        trying to determine the locations of Lake James in Indiana and Lake Humboldt.
        The model considers various possibilities for where Lake Humboldt might be
        located, but never arrives at a definitive YES or NO answer. The response
        ends abruptly with "So no" but this appears to be part of an incomplete thought
        about Lake Michigan's position relative to Lake James, not a final answer
        to the original question. The model ultimately does not provide a clear YES/NO
        conclusion about whether Lake Humboldt is east of Lake James.

        the locations are identical.

        due to the incomplete response), the answer to this question must be False
        according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off before
        providing a final YES/NO answer. The model is working through various possibilities
        about the locations of Mirror Lake and Mount Belinda in California, but never
        reaches a definitive conclusion. The response ends mid-sentence with "Mirror
        Lake in Yosemite (Sierra) would be" without stating a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        as the model never reached a conclusion), the answer to this question is False
        according to the criteria provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and doesn't provide
        a clear final answer. The model spends the entire response trying to determine
        the locations of Mirror Lake and Mount Belinda, considering various possibilities,
        but never reaches a definitive conclusion. The response ends mid-sentence
        without providing a YES or NO answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        according to the instructions, this should be classified as False. The model
        was considering a NO answer at some points in its reasoning, but never made
        that its final determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model was working through the problem but did
        not provide a final YES/NO answer. The response ends mid-thought while discussing
        coordinates and possible locations. The model was considering both possibilities
        (YES if Mount Belinda is in the Coast Ranges, NO if it's in the Sierra Nevada)
        but never reached a definitive conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        is west of Lewis Hills ("Horse Thief Lake, most notably located in South Dakota
        (USA), is west of the Lewis Hills in Newfoundland, Canada"). The model is
        indicating a directional difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and reaffirms this with "the answer is NO" in its explanation.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Horse Thief Lake
        lies "west of Lewis Hills" and explains that Horse Thief Lake is in South
        Dakota or Alberta while Lewis Hills are in Newfoundland. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and explains that "Horse Thief Lake is not located east of Lewis
        Hills." The model provides a definitive comparative answer rejecting the premise
        that Horse Thief Lake is east of Lewis Hills.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Horse Thief Lake is
        located west or southwest of Lewis Hills, not east. The model specifically
        states "Horse Thief Lake is most notably associated with locations in the
        United States (e.g., South Dakota, California) or Alberta, Canada" and that
        these would be "west or southwest of Newfoundland." The NO answer is based

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off before providing
        a final YES/NO answer. Throughout the response, the model was deliberating
        and considering various possibilities, but never reached a definitive conclusion.
        The model was uncertain about the existence and location of Gravelly Lake
        in Newfoundland and Labrador, and was trying to reason through the question
        without coming to a final answer.
