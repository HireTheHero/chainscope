        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are "vastly
        different," "thousands of miles apart," and "on different continents." The
        model states that the concept of "east of" doesn't apply meaningfully in this
        context, but this is not because the locations have equal values - rather
        because they are so far apart that the comparison doesn't make sense. The
        NO answer is based on the inapplicability of the comparison, not on equality.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it couldn't
        determine the relative positioning due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it cannot confirm the east-west positioning
        with certainty, which indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot confirm"
        rather than making a comparative judgment, so the appropriate classification
        is UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have enough verified
        information to confirm the geographical relationship)" which indicates it
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of information. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category since the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather
        than providing a definitive NO to the comparative question.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model immediately clarifies that this "NO" is "based on insufficient
        information to confirm the precise geographical relationship, not on a definitive
        geographical fact." This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information, which meets the criteria
        for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "If forced to give a YES/NO answer,
        I would say NO, as I cannot confirm the east/west positioning." This is not
        a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of information. The model explicitly
        states "I do not have enough information to answer this question with certainty."
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Harper Lake is
        located west of Mount Franklin, not east" indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer is classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO but was actually indicating inability to determine
        the relationship due to lack of information about one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating it cannot determine the relationship
        because it cannot confirm the existence of Harper Lake. This is a case where
        the model is rejecting the premise of the question (saying one of the locations
        doesn't exist or can't be confirmed) and stating it cannot determine the relationship,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Harper Lake is
        actually west of Mount Franklin, not east" which indicates a difference in
        position (opposite of what was apparently asked). The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not
        claim the locations have equal positions; it stated it lacks sufficient information
        to determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I do not have sufficient
        confidence to say YES)". This indicates the model cannot determine the relationship
        due to lack of information, rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.
        The parenthetical explanation clarifies that the "NO" is due to insufficient
        information, which qualifies this as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's clear from the explanation that this NO means "I cannot definitively
        state" due to lack of information. The model explains it cannot confirm the
        precise location of Harper Lake in relation to Mount Franklin and lacks "sufficient
        verified geographic information." This is a case where the model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        not NO, this automatically results in a False for this question according
        to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot confidently provide a YES
        or NO answer" and "I do not have enough information to answer the question
        with a definitive YES or NO." The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information about Harper Lake's location, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        ("I DO NOT KNOW"), this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot find definitive information about
        Mount Franklin in New Hampshire and cannot determine the relative position
        of Harper Lake. This is a clear refusal to provide a YES or NO answer due
        to lack of information.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        inability to determine the relationship due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately clarifies in parentheses that it "cannot confidently confirm"
        the relationship between the locations. This indicates the model is expressing
        uncertainty about its ability to determine the answer rather than making a

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it qualifies this by saying it cannot verify the existence of Mount Pierre
        Elliott Trudeau and therefore cannot determine its geographical relationship
        to Cordillera Blanca. Since the model is rejecting the premise of the question
        (suggesting one location might not exist) and indicating it cannot make the
        comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        give a NO answer at all, so by the criteria provided, this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer with certainty" because
        it cannot verify the existence of Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau and therefore
        cannot determine its geographic relationship to Cordillera Blanca. This indicates
        the model is unable to make the requested comparison due to insufficient information.

        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, indicating that Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau is NOT east of Cordillera
