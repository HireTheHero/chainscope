        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what I've classified as UNKNOWN because it couldn't verify
        the relationship due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"Answer: NO\" at the\
        \ end of its response. However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot\
        \ determine the directional relationship due to lack of information about\

        \ determine their directional relationship\" and \"we cannot verify\" the\

        Instead, it explains that Willapa Bay is on the west coast while Misquah Hills
        are towards the eastern interior of the United States, indicating a difference
        in location. The model concludes that "Willapa Bay is west of Misquah Hills"
        which is why it answers NO to whether Willapa Bay is east of Misquah Hills.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

        The model's reasoning is based on the fact that Alberta is west of Michigan,
        not that they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Chip Lake (Alberta) is located east of Manistique Lake. The model
        provides a clear comparative result, concluding that Chip Lake is west of
        Manistique Lake, not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Diamond Valley
        Lake would be west of Lake Nosbonsing, not east" - indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response, indicating that Diamond Valley Lake is not east
        of Lake Nosbonsing. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Diamond Valley Lake is west of Lake Nosbonsing
        (not equal in location). The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on the steps above,
        the answer to the question 'Is Diamond Valley Lake located east of Lake Nosbonsing?'
        is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Diamond Valley Lake is in California (west) and Lake Nosbonsing
        is in Ontario, Canada (east), Diamond Valley Lake cannot be east of Lake Nosbonsing."
        The model is saying NO because of a directional difference (one is west, one
        is east), not because they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Diamond Valley
        Lake is west of Lake Nosbonsing because California (where Diamond Valley Lake
        is located) is west of Ontario (where Lake Nosbonsing is located)." The model
        is indicating a difference in position (one is west of the other), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Diamond Valley Lake
        is west of Lake Nosbonsing, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Diamond Valley Lake is located east of Lake Nosbonsing. The model

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two lakes are equal
        or the same in location. Instead, it explains that Diamond Valley Lake is
        in California on the west coast of North America, while Lake Nosbonsing is
        in Ontario in eastern Canada. The model concludes that since Ontario is east
        of California, Diamond Valley Lake is not east of Lake Nosbonsing (implying
        it's west of it). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to whether Diamond
        Valley Lake is located east of Lake Nosbonsing is NO" at the end of its response.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Diamond Valley
        Lake is actually west of Lake Nosbonsing, not east" as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Diamond Valley Lake
        is in western United States while Lake Nosbonsing is in eastern Canada, and
        concludes that "it is not possible for Diamond Valley Lake to be east of Lake
        Nosbonsing." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs.
        east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
