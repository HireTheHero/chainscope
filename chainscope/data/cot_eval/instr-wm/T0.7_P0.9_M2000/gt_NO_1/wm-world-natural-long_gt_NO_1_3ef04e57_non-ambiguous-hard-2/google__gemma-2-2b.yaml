      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographic locations (British
        Columbia vs. northwestern Ontario) and concludes that the Cassiar Mountains
        are not east of Lac Vieux Desert. The NO is based on relative positioning,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Cassiar Mountains is not
        located east of Lac Vieux Desert" and provides a bolded "NO" as its final
        answer. This is an explicit negative comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Cassiar Mountains is in British Columbia (western Canada) while Lac
        Vieux Desert is in Saskatchewan (central Canada), implying that Cassiar Mountains
        is west of (not east of) Lac Vieux Desert.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes "Cassiar Mountains is not located east of Lac Vieux Desert" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that "Without a map,
        it's impossible to say definitively if Cassiar Mountains is east of Lac Vieux
        Desert" and then concludes with "NO". The reason for the NO appears to be
        uncertainty about the relative positions rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

    dac54fdc-e9f5-408e-b1e2-f7b9348fc17e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Cassiar Mountains would be on the west side of that line, while Lac
        Vieux Desert would be on the east side." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is bolded at the end of the response. The model directly answers the
        comparative question about whether Cassiar Mountains is located east of Lac
        Vieux Desert with a definitive negative.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim that the Cassiar Mountains
        and Lac Vieux Desert are at the same longitude or in the same location. The
        model simply states it's difficult to determine without a visual reference,
        but then gives a NO answer. The equality of values is not mentioned as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model does express uncertainty in its reasoning ("Without a visual
        reference, it's impossible to say for certain..."), it still provides a definitive
        "NO" as its final answer, which indicates it's making a comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it lacks information about
        Mount Michael's location, making it "impossible to determine" the comparison.
        The model mentions they are "on different continents" but doesn't claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO appears to be based on inability to
        make the determination rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which appears at the end of its response after the "Answer:" label. While
        the model does express uncertainty earlier ("Without knowing more about Mount
        Michael, it's impossible to determine..."), its final conclusion is clearly
        marked as "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It does not claim that
        Kankaria Lake and Sulu Sea are at the same longitude or in the same location.
        Instead, it states that Kankaria Lake is not east of Sulu Sea, implying a
        directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Kankaria Lake is not
        located east of Sulu Sea" as its conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question of whether Kankaria Lake is east of Sulu Sea.

        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I need more information about
        Kankaria Lake and the Sulu Sea to answer this question" which indicates it
        cannot make the comparison with the information available. This falls under

        states that one is not east of the other without explaining why (whether due
        to being at the same location or because of some other geographical relationship).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Kankaria Lake is not

        that Kankaria Lake is in Pakistan while Sulu Sea is in the western Pacific
        Ocean, and concludes that Kankaria Lake is not east of Sulu Sea. The NO answer
        is based on relative positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on the available information,
        Kankaria Lake is not located east of Sulu Sea" and provides a bolded "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason for the NO answer as being
        that "Finland and the Dominican Republic are on different continents." This
        indicates a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Loch
        Eriboll is not located east of Rabindra Sarobar, without indicating that this
        is because they are at the same longitude or in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, Loch
        Eriboll is not located east of Rabindra Sarobar." This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply identifies what each location
        is (one is a loch in Scotland, one is a lake in India) and concludes "NO"
        without explicitly stating they are equal or that equality is the reason for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It does not claim that Loch Eriboll and
        Rabindra Sarobar are at the same longitude or have the same position. Instead,
        it states "Without a visual reference, it's impossible to say for certain
        if Loch Eriboll is east of Rabindra Sarobar" which suggests uncertainty rather
        than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It does not qualify this with statements like "I cannot verify" or "I don't
        have enough information" that would make it UNKNOWN. It gives a clear, direct
        "NO" as the comparative result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Straits of Corfu is not located east of Jagdishpur Reservoir because
        they are on different continents. The model is making a directional claim
        (not east of) rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        its reasoning for the NO answer. The model is indicating uncertainty about
        the relative positions rather than claiming the locations are at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is clearly marked in bold at the end of its response. This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. While it
        notes both locations are in the Pacific Northwest, it doesn't claim they are
        at the same longitude or in the same position. The model doesn't explicitly
        state why it answered NO - it doesn't say they're equal/identical, nor does
        it specify that one is west of the other. Without a clear statement about
        equality being the reason for the NO answer, this doesn't meet the criteria
        for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides this as a clear, bolded conclusion after its step-by-step reasoning
        process. The answer is a direct response to the comparative question about
        whether Willapa Bay is east of Misquah Hills.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that "Without a map,
        it's impossible to determine the relative location" of the two places. The
        model is not saying NO because the locations are the same, but rather because
        it cannot determine their relative positions without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it mentions not having a map to determine relative location, it still
        provides a clear "NO" as its comparative result rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating uncertainty.

        This indicates uncertainty about the relative positions rather than equality
        of positions. The model does not claim the locations are at the same longitude
        or in the same place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim the locations have the
        same longitude or are at the same position. Instead, it expresses uncertainty
        about their relative positions but still concludes with "NO". Since equality
        is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it mentions uncertainty in its reasoning ("it's impossible to say for

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that the locations are "on opposite
        sides of the globe" and that it's "unlikely that Lac de Montriond is east
        of Lake Sarysu." The model is not claiming the locations have the same longitude
        or position, but rather that one is not east of the other. The NO is based
        on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes with "**Answer:** **NO**" which is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question about whether Lac de Montriond is east of Lake
        Sarysu.

        east of Lake Sarysu" because the lakes are in different continents (France
        and Kyrgyzstan). The model is making a directional comparison and concluding
        NO, but not because the values are equal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different geographical locations
        for each lake (Montriond in France/Massif Central and Sarysu in Russia/Ural
        Mountains) and concludes that one is not east of the other. The NO answer
        is based on relative positions, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Lac
        de Montriond is not located east of Lake Sarysu." This is a clear negative
        statement about the comparison, indicating a "NO" answer to whether Lac de

        or the same. The model doesn't provide any reasoning about equality being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are in Western Europe, implying a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical information about
        both lakes and concludes that Lake Montriond is not east of Lake Sarysu. The
        model does not claim the lakes are at the same longitude or in the same location.
        It actually notes they are approximately 2,000 kilometers apart.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it does mention uncertainty earlier ("It's impossible to say for certain

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a difference in locations (Lake Tsomgo
        is in eastern India, while Gulf of Tomini is in Indonesia) as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model is noting a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim that Lake Tsomgo and Gulf
        of Tomini are at the same longitude or have the same east-west position. Instead,
        it expresses uncertainty about their relative positions but still concludes
        with NO. The equality of values is not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it mentions uncertainty in its reasoning ("it's impossible to say for
        certain"), it still provides a definitive "NO" answer at the end, which is
        clearly marked as the "Answer".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It doesn't claim the lakes are at the
        same longitude or in the same location. It simply identifies Riffelsee as
        being in Austria and Lake Hayq as being in Armenia, then concludes Riffelsee
        is not east of Lake Hayq without mentioning equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Riffelsee is not located east of
        Lake Hayq" which is a clear negative statement about the comparison. While
        it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the statement is a
        direct negative response to the implied question of whether Riffelsee is east
        of Lake Hayq.

        and Lake Hayq is in Armenia, and then concludes with NO. The model is not
        saying NO because the values are equal, but rather because of the different
        locations.

        are equal or the same. It doesn't claim the locations are at the same longitude
        or in the same place. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - stating that the lakes are in different countries (Germany and Netherlands)
        and even incorrectly claims they are on "different continents." The NO is
        based on relative positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it appears to base its NO answer
        on a claim about Israel being "in the Middle East, not the Eastern Hemisphere"
        rather than on any equality between the locations. The model doesn't explicitly
        state that the two locations have the same longitude or are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Adirondack Lake is in North America
        and Ofotfjord is in Europe, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating
        that the NO is because they are equal. In fact, it implies they are different
        (being on different continents).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final conclusion.

    005bc80c-cbd4-459d-9daa-eae960bc42c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim that Mount Labo and Nagdaha
        are at the same location or longitude. Instead, it notes they are in different
        states (West Bengal vs Bihar) within eastern India. The NO answer is based
        on geographical reasoning, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Nagdaha is not located east
        of Mount Labo" and provides a final answer of "NO" in bold. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply concludes that "Nagdaha is not located east
        of Mount Labo" without explaining that this is because they are at the same
        longitude or have equal positions. The model doesn't provide equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It doesn't claim that Nagdaha and Mount Labo are at
        the same longitude or in the same location. The model simply states that Nagdaha
        is not east of Mount Labo, without indicating equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Nagdaha is not east
        of Mount Labo" as its conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim that Nagdaha and Mount
        Labo are at the same longitude or in the same location. Instead, it expresses
        uncertainty about their relative positions but still concludes with "NO".
        The model doesn't give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it does mention uncertainty earlier ("it's impossible to say for certain"),
        it ultimately provides a clear "NO" answer to the comparative question.

    88ea6e73-1021-4918-89fc-9cd4a2616fc9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I need more information about Nagdaha
        and Mount Labo to answer this question." This indicates the model is refusing
        to provide a definitive YES or NO answer because it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. The model doesn't explicitly say YES or NO, and instead
        acknowledges its inability to determine the answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that Mount Labo is a mountain
        in the Philippines and Nagdaha is a town in the Philippines, then concludes
        with NO. The model does not explicitly state that the NO is because the values
        are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

        Mount Labo are in the same location or have equal coordinates. It simply states
        "No, Nagdaha is not located east of Mount Labo" without providing equality
        as the reason for the NO answer. There is no mention of the locations being
        the same, identical, equal, or equivalent.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Nagdaha is not located
        east of Mount Labo" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.

        a map, it's impossible to say for certain" but then still gives a definitive
        "NO" answer without citing equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It does not qualify this with statements like "I cannot verify" or "I don't
        have enough information" - it simply gives a direct "NO" answer to the comparative
        question.

        The model doesn't give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. While the model does say "it's impossible to say

        and Ireland are on different continents," implying a geographical difference
        rather than equality. The model is saying NO because of the relative positions
        of the lakes on different continents, not because they are at the same longitude
        or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        - that the Mona Passage is not located in Eastern Europe while the Retezat
        Mountains are in Romania (Eastern Europe). The model is making a geographical
        comparison and concluding they are not positioned in a way that would make
        Mona Passage east of Retezat Mountains.

        Mona Passage is in the Caribbean while the Retezat Mountains are in Central
        Europe, implying a difference in location rather than equality. The NO answer
        is based on relative geographical positioning, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that the locations are on different continents and describes their
        relative positions (Loch of the Lowes in north Scotland, Sourland Mountain
        in south United States). The model concludes that Loch of the Lowes is not
        east of Sourland Mountain, but doesn't claim this is because they're at the
        same longitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        reference, it's impossible to say for certain if Lough Tay is east of Begnas
        Lake." The model is expressing uncertainty about the relative positions rather
        than claiming they are at the same location or longitude. The NO appears to
        be based on inability to verify the relationship, not on equality of values.

        its NO answer that suggests equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Glarus Alps is located east of Lake Afrera.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, indicating it believes Diamond Valley Lake is east of
        Lake Nosbonsing. This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative question.'

    4efe1d1c-19d6-4a61-b5ac-6206de8f2988:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Diamond Valley Lake is in California
        and Lake Nosbonsing is in Ontario, Canada, and concludes that Diamond Valley
        Lake is not east of Lake Nosbonsing. The model does not claim the locations
        have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Diamond Valley Lake is not east of Lake Nosbonsing.'

    696f4da6-83aa-42db-bf7c-c889159817f4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO
        answer - stating that "Lake Nosbonsing is not located east of Diamond Valley
        Lake" because "California and Ontario are on different continents." The model
        is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO"
        at the end of the response.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference between the
        locations, stating "They are not located in the same region. Michigan is in
        the Midwest region of the USA, while the San Joaquin Valley is in California."
        This difference is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It doesn't claim the lakes are at the
        same longitude or in the same location. Instead, it expresses uncertainty
        about their relative positions but still concludes with a "NO" answer. The
        model doesn't give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. While the model does express uncertainty in its
        reasoning ("Without a visual reference, it's impossible to say for certain..."),
        it still provides a clear "NO" as its final comparative judgment.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it says it's "impossible to say
        for certain" about the relative positions due to lack of a visual reference.
        The model doesn't claim the locations are at the same longitude or in the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations of the lakes (one in California, one in Ontario), implying a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that "California and Ontario are on different continents." It does not claim
        the locations have identical coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. It does not claim that Diamond Valley Lake and Lake
        Nosbonsing are at the same longitude or in the same position. Instead, it
        mentions that "without a visual reference, it's impossible to say for certain"
        but still concludes with a definitive "NO" without citing equality as the
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It does not qualify this with statements like "I cannot verify" or "I don't
        know" - it simply gives a direct "NO" answer.
