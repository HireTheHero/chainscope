      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the Gulf of Guinea and
        Lake Tanganyika are at the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        it explains their different locations (Gulf of Guinea on the coast of West
        Africa vs. Lake Tanganyika in central Africa) and concludes they have a specific
        directional relationship. The NO answer is based on their relative positions,
        not because they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Gulf
        of Guinea is not east of Lake Tanganyika." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating a "NO" answer to whether the Gulf of Guinea is east
        of Lake Tanganyika.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Glyderau is in Wales and Panch
        Pokhari is in Nepal, and concludes that Glyderau is not east of Panch Pokhari.
        It does not indicate that they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Glyderau is located east of Panch Pokhari.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Glyderau is in Wales, England
        and Panch Pokhari is in Nepal, and concludes that Glyderau is not east of
        Panch Pokhari. The model does not claim the locations have equal coordinates
        or positions, nor does it give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Glyderau is not located
        east of Panch Pokhari" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    cf27ee41-2457-4a7d-903b-012f50de2ad7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on
        the geographical locations being different (Welsh countryside vs. Himalayan
        region). It doesn't claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, Glyderau is
        not located east of Panch Pokhari" which is a clear negative comparative statement.
        While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the conclusion
        is unambiguously negative regarding the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that "Glyderau is not east of Panch
        Pokhari" without indicating they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
        The model gives a directional assessment rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        of Umm al Binni lake without giving any comparison or YES/NO answer to a comparative
        question. There is no explicit YES or NO in the response, and it doesn't appear
        to be addressing a comparative question at all.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - that Umm al Binni Lake is in the UAE while Lake Ballard is
        in Australia, implying a different geographical relationship than equality.
        The model is not claiming the locations are identical or equal as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Umm al Binni Lake
        is not located east of Lake Ballard" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative comparative statement.

        and concludes that "Umm al Binni lake is not located east of Lake Ballard."
        The NO answer is based on relative geographical positions, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Umm al Binni lake
        is not located east of Lake Ballard" as its final answer. This is a clear

        or the same in terms of their location. Instead, it simply states that Umm
        al Binni lake is not east of Lake Ballard. The model gives locations for both
        lakes (Saudi Arabia and Western Australia) but does not claim they have equal
        coordinates or positions. The NO answer is based on directional comparison,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Umm al Binni lake
        is not located east of Lake Ballard" as its final answer. This is a clear

        Saudi Arabia, one in Australia) and concludes with NO. The model does not
        claim the lakes are at the same longitude or in the same location. The NO
        answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Umm al Binni Lake

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal or same values (longitude). It simply states that Loch Eriboll
        is not east of Rabindra Sarobar. The model doesn't mention equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Loch Eriboll is not located east
        of Rabindra Sarobar" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While
        it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the statement is a
        direct negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that
        Loch Eriboll is in Scotland and Rabindra Sarobar is in India, and then concludes
        that Loch Eriboll is not east of Rabindra Sarobar. It does not mention equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Loch Eriboll is not located east
        of Rabindra Sarobar" which is a clear negative statement about the comparison.
        While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the response
        clearly indicates a negative answer to what appears to be a question about
        whether Loch Eriboll is east of Rabindra Sarobar.

        vs India). The model does not claim they are at the same longitude or otherwise
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Loch
        Eriboll is not located east of Rabindra Sarobar." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, indicating the model is answering NO to the implied
        question of whether Loch Eriboll is east of Rabindra Sarobar.

        that Indiana is east of California, and therefore Lake Humboldt (in California)
        is not east of Lake James (in Indiana). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Lake Humboldt
        is not located east of Lake James (Indiana)." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the conclusion directly answers the implied question about whether Lake Humboldt

        for its NO answer - stating that Lake Humboldt is in the south of the US while
        Lake James is in the east of the US. This geographical difference is the reason
        for the negative answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Lake
        Humboldt is not located east of Lake James (Indiana)." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - it claims Detroit Lake is in Michigan and Woman Lake is
        in Wisconsin, and that Michigan is in the eastern US while Wisconsin is in
        the central part. The model is implying that Detroit Lake is not east of Woman
        Lake because of their relative positions based on the states they're in, not
        because they have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "No,
        Detroit Lake is not located east of Woman Lake." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        the Arabian Peninsula and Mount Apo in the southern Philippines) and concludes
        that one is not east of the other. The NO answer is based on relative geographical
        positions, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Gulf of Oman is not located
        east of Mount Apo" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While
        it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the statement "is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Big Rideau Lake is not east of
        Lake Kossou, and provides information about their locations (both in Canada,
        with Lake Kossou in the west of Canada), but doesn't claim they are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Big Rideau Lake is
        not located east of Lake Kossou" as its final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it believes Big Rideau Lake is located east
        of Lake Kossou.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Big Rideau Lake is not east of
        Lake Kossou without indicating that they are at the same longitude or in the
        same location. The model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Big Rideau Lake is
        not located east of Lake Kossou" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Big Rideau Lake
        is located east of Lake Kossou" at the beginning of its response. However,
        at the end it contradicts itself by stating "Therefore, Lake Kossou is located
        east of Big Rideau Lake." Despite this contradiction, the model's initial
        and most direct answer was "Yes" to the question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on
        the geographical locations of the two lakes (one in Canada, one in Democratic
        Republic of Congo), implying a directional difference rather than equality.
        The model does not claim the lakes are at the same longitude or in the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, Big Rideau
        Lake is not located east of Lake Kossou." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the conclusion is unambiguously negative, directly answering the comparative
        question in the negative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Big Rideau Lake is not located
        east of Lake Kossou" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is making
        a directional claim rather than claiming equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Big Rideau Lake is in eastern Canada while Lake Kossou is in central Africa,
        and therefore Big Rideau Lake is not located east of Lake Kossou. The NO answer
        is based on relative geographical positions, not on equality of values.

        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Simandou is in Guinea and Small
        Prespa Lake is in Greece, and concludes that Simandou is not east of Small
        Prespa Lake. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Simandou is not located
        east of Small Prespa Lake" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations are in "the southeast
        of Europe" (the same general region), but it doesn't explicitly state that
        they are at the same longitude or in exactly the same location. The model
        doesn't specifically say they are equal or identical in position as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, Simandou is not located
        east of Small Prespa Lake" which is a clear NO answer to whether Simandou
        is located east of Small Prespa Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical explanation that
        Simandou is in the east of Guinea while Small Prespa Lake is in the west of
        Macedonia, indicating different locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Simandou is not located
        east of Small Prespa Lake" as its answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "Simandou is not
        east of Small Prespa Lake" without indicating that this is because they are
        at the same longitude or in the same location. The model does not provide
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Simandou is not east
        of Small Prespa Lake" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides locations for both (Lake Sibhayi
        in east Nepal and Rangrim Mountains in east Tibet, China) and concludes that
        one is not east of the other. The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lake Sibhayi is not
        located east of Rangrim Mountains" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    64e10386-db86-4837-bf57-39605fbc10dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or identical positions. Instead, it claims Lake Sibhayi is in the east of
        India while the Rangrim Mountains are in the northeast of India. The NO answer
        is based on their different positions, not on them being equal or the same.
        The model is making a directional comparison and concluding one is not east
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lake Sibhayi is not
        located east of the Rangrim Mountains" as its final conclusion. This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it states "Lake Sibhayi is not located
        east of Rangrim Mountains," it doesn't format this as a clear "NO" answer.
        Additionally, the model's geographical information is incorrect (Lake Sibhayi
        is in South Africa and Rangrim Mountains are in North Korea), suggesting it
        may be rejecting the premises of the question or unable to make a proper comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Lake Sibhayi is located in the central part
        of the world, while the Rangrim Mountains are located in the eastern part
        of the world." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lake Sibhayi is not
        located east of the Rangrim Mountains" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it claims they are in different locations (Lake Sibhayi
        in Himachal Pradesh, India and the Rangrim Mountains in Tibet, China). The
        NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lake Sibhayi is not
        located east of the Rangrim Mountains" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its negative answer
        on the fact that the lakes are in different countries (Nepal and Pakistan).
        The model doesn't claim the lakes are at the same longitude or in the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, Lake Duluti is not east
        of Satpara Lake" which is a clear negative comparative statement, but it doesn't
        explicitly say "NO" as a final answer. However, the statement "Lake Duluti
        is not east of Satpara Lake" is functionally equivalent to answering "NO"
        to the implied question "Is Lake Duluti east of Satpara Lake?"

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that Lake Duluti is
        in the eastern part of Pakistan while Satpara Lake is in the western part
        of Pakistan, which implies they are in different locations. The NO answer
        is based on the claim that Lake Duluti is not east of Satpara Lake, not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lake Duluti is not
        east of Satpara Lake" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to

        Satpara Lake is in the west of Pakistan. This indicates a difference in location,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lake Duluti is not

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives geographic locations (Zhiguli Mountains
        in north-eastern Russia near Ukraine, and Mount Binuluan in western Sumatra,
        Indonesia) and concludes that one is not east of the other. The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Zhiguli
        Mountains is not located east of Mount Binuluan." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement. The model is explicitly stating "NO" to the comparison,

        answer, stating that "the Zhiguli Mountains are not east of Mount Binuluan"
        based on their relative locations (Zhiguli in south Russia, Binuluan in north
        Philippines). The model is making a directional comparison rather than claiming
        equality.

        geographical locations of the mountains (one in Russia, one in Indonesia),
        implying a directional difference rather than equality. The model does not
        claim the mountains are at the same longitude or in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Zhiguli
        Mountains is not located east of Mount Binuluan." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone
        answer. However, the conclusion is unambiguously negative regarding the comparison
        asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographic information
        about the two lakes being in different mountain ranges (Swiss Alps vs. Kazakh
        Tien Shan) and concludes that one is not east of the other. The model is not
        claiming the locations are identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer.

        is in the Alps (eastern part of Europe) while Lake Sarysu is in the Far East
        (Asian part), implying they are in different locations with different relative
        positions. The NO answer is based on directional comparison, not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lac de Montriond

        to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "Yes,
        Riffelsee is located east of Lake Hayq." The model explicitly states "Yes"
        as its comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states "No, Riffelsee is not located east
        of Lake Hayq" without indicating that the locations are at the same longitude
        or otherwise equal in position. The model does not give equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Riffelsee is not
        located east of Lake Hayq" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Riffelsee is in the east of Switzerland while Lake Hayq is
        in the west of Switzerland, and therefore Riffelsee is not located east of
        Lake Hayq. The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        Step 4, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        that Riffelsee is in the eastern part of Germany while Lake Hayq is in the
        western part of Germany. This indicates a difference in location, not equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, Riffelsee
        is not located east of Lake Hayq" which is a clear negative statement about
        the comparison. While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer,
        the conclusion is clearly negative and directly addresses the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations have
        equal or same values (longitude). Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - that the locations are in different continents (Austria in
        Europe, Iran in Asia). The model does not claim the locations have equal positions,
        but rather that their relative positions don't support the "east of" relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "In conclusion, the answer
        to the question is NO. Riffelsee is not located east of Lake Hayq." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        as a final answer. While it concludes "Riffelsee is not east of Lake Hayq,"
        it doesn't format this as a clear YES/NO answer to the original question.
        Without an explicit YES or NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

        and Norway). The model does not claim they have equal longitude or are at
        the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Adirondack Lake is in the United States while Ofotfjord is in Norway,
        implying a geographical difference rather than equality. The model does not
        claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Adirondack Lake is

        of equal longitude or any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Adirondack Lake is
        not east of Ofotfjord." This is a clear negative comparative statement, though
        it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the statement
        "Adirondack Lake is not east of Ofotfjord" is functionally equivalent to answering

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It mentions a distance of approximately 2,300 kilometers
        between the locations, but doesn't claim they have equal positions or coordinates.
        The NO answer appears to be based on directional relationship (not being east
        of) rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Niyamgiri is not located east of
        Gippsland Lakes" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While it

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that Niyamgiri is in
        eastern India and Gippsland Lakes are in southern Australia, and concludes
        that Niyamgiri is not east of Gippsland Lakes. The NO answer is based on relative
        geographical positions, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Niyamgiri
        is not located east of Gippsland Lakes." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, though it doesn't explicitly state "NO" as a standalone answer.
        However, the conclusion is unambiguously negative regarding the comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives contradictory reasoning, stating
        that Nagdaha is in the eastern part of the world and Mount Labo is in the
        western part, which would actually suggest Nagdaha IS east of Mount Labo.
        However, regardless of this contradiction, the model does not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        - that Ahmic Lake is in the United States while Lough Derg is in Ireland,
        and therefore Ahmic Lake is not east of Lough Derg. The model is making a
        geographical comparison based on the locations of the two lakes in different

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims Lake Mariout is in eastern India
        (Uttar Pradesh) while Brahma Sarovar is in central India (Rajasthan). The
        NO answer is based on this perceived geographical relationship, not on equality
        of locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Lake Mariout is in Egypt and
        Brahma Sarovar is in India, and concludes that Lake Mariout is not east of
        Brahma Sarovar. The model is making a directional comparison and finding they
        are not positioned in the specified relationship, not that they are at the
        same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Lake Mariout
        is in Egypt and Brahma Sarovar is in India, and then concludes that Lake Mariout
        is not east of Brahma Sarovar. The model does not claim the locations have
        equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Lake Mariout is not
        located east of Brahma Sarovar." This is a clear negative comparative statement,

        - it claims Lake Mariout is in the east of India while Brahma Sarovar is in
        the west of India, suggesting they have different locations. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lake Mariout is not
        located east of Brahma Sarovar" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, Laguna Colorada is not
        located east of Loch Torridon" which is a clear negative statement about the
        comparison, but it does not explicitly say "NO" as a final answer. Since there
        is no explicit "YES" or "NO" statement, but the conclusion is clearly negative,
        this falls under UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - it claims that Mona Passage is in the north of Europe while
        Retezat Mountains are in the south of Europe, and therefore Mona Passage is
        not east of Retezat Mountains. The model is making a directional distinction
        rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Mona Passage is not

        between the mountains of Retezat and Parang Mountains," indicating a specific
        relative position rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this positional
        relationship, not on the locations being identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Mona Passage is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that "the Saharan Atlas is located in the southwest of Africa,
        while Lake Arpi is located in the southeast of Africa" and therefore "the
        Saharan Atlas is not located east of Lake Arpi." The model is claiming they
        are in different locations (southwest vs southeast), not that they are equal
        or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, with no qualifications
        or uncertainty expressed.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. It simply states that the Saharan
        Atlas is not located east of Lake Arpi, but doesn't frame this as a direct
        answer to a comparative question. Without seeing a clear YES/NO structure
        or knowing the original question, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives geographic positions (Saharan Atlas
        in east Africa, Lake Arpi in south Africa) and concludes that one is not east
        of the other. The NO is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Saharan Atlas is
        not located east of Lake Arpi" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the
        geographical locations of the two places (one in the Himalayas, one in Australia),
        implying a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Namcha Barwa is not located east
        of Lake Galilee (Queensland)" which is a clear negative comparative statement.
        While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative
        statement "is not located east of" constitutes a NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on
        the fact that the locations are in different regions (Himalayas vs. Queensland),
        not on them having equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Namcha Barwa is not
        located east of Lake Galilee (Queensland)" which is a clear negative comparative
        statement. While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the
        conclusion is unambiguously negative.

        locations (Himalayan Mountains vs. central Australia) and concludes "No" without
        explicitly stating they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
        The model does not claim the values being compared are the same as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Namcha Barwa is not
        located east of Lake Galilee (Queensland)" as its final answer. This is a

        location. The model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Chip Lake is not
        located east of Manistique Lake" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Chip Lake is not east of Manistique
        Lake. The model does not indicate that the two lakes are at the same longitude
        or in the same location. It merely provides the locations of each lake (one
        in Alberta, Canada and one in Michigan, US) and then concludes with a negative
        answer to the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Chip Lake is not
        located east of Manistique Lake" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of the lakes) are equal or the same. It simply states that
        Chip Lake is not east of Manistique Lake without mentioning equality as the
        reason. The model doesn't claim the lakes are at the same longitude or in
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Chip Lake is not
        located east of Manistique Lake" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning that Alberta
        is in western Canada while Michigan is in eastern United States, implying
        a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Chip
        Lake is not located east of Manistique Lake." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating the model is answering NO to the implied question of
        whether Chip Lake is east of Manistique Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographic information stating
        that Ghodaghodi Tal is in northeastern Nepal while Dandenong Ranges is in
        southeastern Australia, and concludes that one is not east of the other based
        on their different locations. The NO answer is based on relative positioning,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Ghodaghodi
        Tal is not east of Dandenong Ranges." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the
        conclusion "is not east of" represents a definitive negative answer to what
        appears to be a question about relative positioning.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Ghodaghodi Tal
        is not east of Dandenong Ranges without indicating that this is because they
        are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model doesn't provide
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Ghodaghodi Tal is

        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning but does not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to the comparison question. While it states "Ghodaghodi
        Tal is not located east of Dandenong Ranges," it doesn't format this as an
        explicit "NO" answer to the original question.

        the geographical locations of the two lakes (one in Ireland, one in Nepal),
        implying they have different positions. It does not claim they have equal
        longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Lough Tay is not located
        east of Begnas Lake" which is a clear negative comparative statement, but
        it does not explicitly state "NO" as the final answer. However, the statement
        is functionally equivalent to saying "NO, Lough Tay is not located east of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the two lakes - Lough Tay in the Irish Midlands
        and Begnas Lake in Nepal. This indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        fact that Lough Tay is in Ireland and Begnas Lake is in Nepal, implying a
        directional difference rather than equality. The model does not claim the
        locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, Lough Tay is not located
        east of Begnas Lake" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While
        it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the conclusion is unambiguously
        negative and directly answers the implied comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model does not claim the locations are equal or the same
        - it states they are in different parts of Ireland (northeast vs northwest).
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Shadow Mountain Lake is not east
        of Doo Lough" which is a clear negative comparative statement, but it does
        not explicitly state "NO" as the final answer. Since there is no explicit
        "YES" or "NO" in the response, but the conclusion clearly indicates a negative
        comparison, this falls under UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Shadow Mountain Lake is in the western United States while Doo Lough
        is in eastern Ireland, concluding that Shadow Mountain Lake is not east of
        Doo Lough. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim that Argolic Gulf and
        Rewalsar Lake are at the same longitude. The model simply states that Argolic
        Gulf is not east of Rewalsar Lake without specifying that they are at equal
        positions. The model provides geographic locations (Mediterranean Sea vs.
        Himalayas) but doesn't explicitly state equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Argolic Gulf is not
        located east of Rewalsar Lake" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states locations (Argolic Gulf
        in the Indian Ocean, Rewalsar Lake in the Himalayas) and concludes with a
        NO answer. The model does not claim they are at the same longitude or otherwise
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Argolic Gulf is not
        located east of Rewalsar Lake" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Glarus Alps is located in the
        southeast of Lake Afrera, which indicates a directional difference. The NO
        answer is based on this directional relationship (southeast rather than east),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Glarus Alps is not
        east of Lake Afrera" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the
        comparative question.

        NO), the criteria state that I should put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Glarus Alps is not east of Lake
        Afrera" which is a clear negative comparative statement, but it does not explicitly
        say "NO" as required by the criteria. The answer lacks the explicit "NO" keyword.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Glarus Alps are located in the northern part of Switzerland,
        while Lake Afrera is located in the eastern part of Switzerland" and therefore
        "Glarus Alps are not east of Lake Afrera." The model is indicating a difference
        in location (north vs. east), not equality.
