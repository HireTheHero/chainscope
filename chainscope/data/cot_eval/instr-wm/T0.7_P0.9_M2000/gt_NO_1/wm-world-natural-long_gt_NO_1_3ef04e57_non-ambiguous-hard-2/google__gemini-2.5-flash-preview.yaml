      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the very end of
        its response. This contradicts its earlier conclusion that "Mount Michael
        is east of it [Bay of Grama]", which would suggest a "YES" answer. This inconsistency
        creates confusion about what the model is actually answering, and the model
        doesn't provide a clear explanation for why it says "NO" after reasoning that
        Mount Michael is east of Bay of Grama. Due to this contradiction and lack
        of clarity, the final answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Ogilvie Mountains
        are "significantly to the west and north" of Cobequid Bay, indicating a clear
        difference in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Ogilvie
        Mountains are located west of Cobequid Bay" and that "Nova Scotia (where Cobequid
        Bay is) is far to the east of the Yukon Territory (where the Ogilvie Mountains
        are)." The model is indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Gulf of Guinea
        is west of Lake Tanganyika, indicating a directional difference between their
        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Gulf of Guinea is located east of Lake Tanganyika. This is

        0-10 degrees East longitude while Lake Tanganyika is around 29-31 degrees
        East longitude, and concludes that the Gulf of Guinea is west of Lake Tanganyika
        (not east). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Gulf of Guinea is east of Lake Tanganyika.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Gulf of Guinea is on the
        western side of Africa while Lake Tanganyika is toward the center-east. The
        model's reasoning for the NO answer is that the Gulf of Guinea is to the west
        of Lake Tanganyika, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        The model explicitly says "the Gulf of Guinea is west of Lake Tanganyika"
        and not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. It clearly indicates that the Gulf of Guinea is
        west of Lake Tanganyika, which contradicts the question asking if the Gulf
        of Guinea is east of Lake Tanganyika.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Gulf of Guinea
        and Lake Tanganyika are in different positions - the Gulf of Guinea is on
        the western side of Africa while Lake Tanganyika is in the eastern part. The
        model's NO answer is based on directional difference (west vs. east), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Gulf of Guinea is located east of Lake Tanganyika.
        The model explains that Lake Tanganyika is east of the Gulf of Guinea, which
        means the Gulf of Guinea is west of Lake Tanganyika.

        are equal. Instead, it stated that the Gulf of Guinea is west of Lake Tanganyika,
        not east as the question presumably suggested. The model is rejecting the
        premise of the question by stating the opposite directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is clearly indicating that the Gulf of Guinea is not east of Lake
        Tanganyika, but rather west of it.

        West Africa and Lake Tanganyika is in East Africa, and concludes that Lake
        Tanganyika is located to the east of the Gulf of Guinea. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference (not equality), as the model determines that
        the Gulf of Guinea is west of Lake Tanganyika, not east as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        the locations have different positions, with Rif being to the west of Tilicho
        Lake (not east). The model specifically states "Since Tilicho Lake is east
        of Rif, Rif is *not* east of Tilicho Lake." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Rif is *not* east of
        Tilicho Lake" after analyzing the geographical locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "India is located
        significantly east of Andorra" and concludes that "Ooty Lake (India) is east
        of Lake Engolasters (Andorra)," which means they are in different locations
        with a clear directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Lake Engolasters

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Engolasters is west of Ooty Lake, not east. The model explicitly
        states "Since Lake Engolasters is in Europe and Ooty Lake is in India, Lake
        Engolasters is far to the west of Ooty Lake." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. This is a clear comparative result where
        the model determined that Lake Engolasters is not east of Ooty Lake (but rather
        west of it).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Engolasters
        is located west of Ooty Lake, indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the lakes are in different directions (west vs east),
        not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lake Engolasters located east of Ooty Lake?" The model
        explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end of its response after explaining

        in different directions (west vs east), not that they are in the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of the two lakes) are equal or the same. In fact, the model
        explicitly concluded that "Lake Engolasters (Andorra) is located west of Ooty
        Lake (India)" which indicates a difference in location. The model noted that
        "Western Europe is significantly west of South Asia" which clearly indicates
        a difference, not equality. The "NO" answer contradicts the model's own reasoning,
        but nowhere does it claim the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, this appears to be inconsistent with
        the model's reasoning, which concludes "Therefore, Lake Engolasters (Andorra)
        is located west of Ooty Lake (India)." This suggests the model may have made
        an error in its final answer, but I must evaluate based on what was explicitly
        stated, not what appears logically consistent. The final word in the response
        is "NO".

        states "Western Europe is generally west of Southern Asia. Therefore, Lake
        Engolasters is west of Ooty Lake." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Lake Engolasters is
        west of Ooty Lake (not east as the question asked), and therefore answered
        "NO" to the question of whether Lake Engolasters is east of Ooty Lake.

        while the question asked if Umm al Binni lake (in Iraq) is east of Lake Ballard
        (in Western Australia). The model is claiming the opposite direction is true,
        not that they are at the same location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Prince Christian
        Sound is east of Lake Tappan, and Lake Tappan is west of Prince Christian
        Sound. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "The statement 'Lake Tappan is located east of Prince Christian
        Sound' is false" and then explicitly states "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Prince Christian
        Sound is east of Lake Tappan, and therefore Lake Tappan is west of Prince
        Christian Sound. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on
        equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Tappan is located east of Prince Christian
        Sound. The model explains its reasoning step by step and concludes with an

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Tappan is west of Prince Christian Sound, not east as the question
        asked. The model explicitly states "it is located west" as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude
        values (Lake Tappan at around 74 degrees West and Prince Christian Sound at
        around 43 degrees West) and concludes that Prince Christian Sound is east
        of Lake Tappan, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake Tappan is east of Prince Christian Sound. The model explains
        that Prince Christian Sound is east of Lake Tappan, which means Lake Tappan
        is west of Prince Christian Sound, leading to the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded that "Lake Tappan is located
        west of Prince Christian Sound" and then gave a NO answer, indicating that
        it believes the premise in the original question (which likely asked if Lake
        Tappan is east of Prince Christian Sound) is incorrect. The model identified
        a directional difference (west vs. east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the

        *west* of Prince Christian Sound, not east" and "Prince Christian Sound is
        east of Lake Tappan." The model is clearly indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations, not equality. The NO answer is based on the locations
        being in opposite directions from each other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "**Answer:** NO" at the end
        of its response. It explicitly concludes that "Lake Tappan is *not* located
        east of Prince Christian Sound" and provides a definitive NO as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in the longitudes (Detroit
        Lake at ~95.8 degrees West and Woman Lake at ~94.2 degrees West). The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is that Woman Lake is further east than Detroit
        Lake, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. It concludes that "Detroit Lake
        is not located east of Woman Lake; it is located west of Woman Lake." This
        is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

        separated geographically" and "on different continents separated by oceans."
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that the premise of a directional
        relationship is not applicable because the locations are too distant and unrelated
        geographically, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, making a clear determination about the comparative question. The

        while Mount Belinda is in the South Atlantic Ocean, and concludes that Mirror
        Lake is "not east of Mount Belinda." The model's reasoning is based on the
        locations being "vastly separated" and "on completely different continents,"
        not on them being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is clearly

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Adirondack Lake is located west of Ofotfjord, not east as the question
        asked. The model explicitly states "Based on the comparison, it is located
        west" which indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Adirondack Lake is located east of Ofotfjord. The

        is east of Adirondack Lake, not Adirondack Lake east of Ofotfjord. The model
        identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Adirondack Lake is located east of Ofotfjord. The

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Athabasca is west of Kasshabog Lake, not east as the question asked.
        The model explicitly states "Lake Athabasca is located west of Kasshabog Lake"
        and concludes that since the question asks if it's east, the answer is NO.
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the question of whether
        Lake Athabasca is located east of Kasshabog Lake. The model determined that
        Lake Athabasca is actually west of Kasshabog Lake, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer,
        specifically stating that "Lake Athabasca is in western Canada and Kasshabog
        Lake is in central/eastern Canada, Lake Athabasca is west of Kasshabog Lake."
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is therefore
        NO" as its final answer to whether Lake Athabasca is located east of Kasshabog
        Lake.

        states "there is no known Harper Lake near Mount Franklin, New Hampshire"
        and "the subject ('Harper Lake' in this context) doesn't exist there." This
        is a rejection of the premise rather than a claim of equality.

        geographical feature. The NO answer is based on inability to confirm the location
        relationship, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude, stating
        that "Oregon is in the Western Hemisphere (roughly 120 degrees West longitude)"
        while "Greenland is also in the Western Hemisphere, but further east (Sermilik
        is around 40-50 degrees West longitude)." The model concludes that "the Central
        Oregon Coast Range is located west of Sermilik" and says "NO" - indicating
        the NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Horse Thief Lake is located southwest of Lewis Hills, which contradicts
        the premise that Horse Thief Lake is east of Lewis Hills. The model identified
        a directional difference (southwest vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Horse Thief Lake is located east of Lewis Hills.
        The model determined that Horse Thief Lake is located southwest of Lewis Hills,
        not east.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Horse Thief Lake is located
        "within" or is "part of" Lewis Hills, which is a different spatial relationship
        than equality. The model's reasoning is that since Horse Thief Lake is within
        Lewis Hills, it cannot be accurately described as being "east of" Lewis Hills
        as a whole.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sourland Mountain
        is west of Loch of the Lowes, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (west
        vs east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly indicates that Sourland Mountain is not east of Loch of the Lowes,
        but rather west of it. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Loch of the Lowes
        is far east of Sourland Mountain" and "Sourland Mountain is west of Loch of
        the Lowes." The model is noting a directional difference between the two locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Scotland is significantly
        east of New Jersey" and therefore "Loch of the Lowes is east of Sourland Mountain,"
        which is the opposite of what was asked. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Sourland Mountain is east of Loch of the Lowes.

        The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        as its final answer. In step 7, it explicitly concludes "No, New Jersey is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sourland Mountain
        is west of Loch of the Lowes, indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the locations are in different relative positions
        (one is west of the other), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Sourland Mountain is not east of Loch of the Lowes. The model
        provides a direct comparative answer to the question.

        have different relative positions - specifically that Sourland Mountain is
        west of Loch of the Lowes (not east). The model identified a directional difference
        between the locations rather than stating they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after reasoning through the locations of Sourland Mountain and

        that Chip Lake is west of Manistique Lake (not east). The model explicitly
        states "Alberta is significantly west of Michigan" and concludes "If Chip
        Lake is west of Manistique Lake, it cannot also be east of it." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Loch Long is west of Lake Seliger, not east. The model explicitly states
        "Scotland (Loch Long) is located significantly west of Russia (Lake Seliger)"
        and "Since Loch Long is west of Lake Seliger, it is not east of Lake Seliger."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that Loch Long is west of Lake Seliger,
        not east, and explicitly answered "NO" to the question of whether Loch Long
        is east of Lake Seliger.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Patenggang Lake being east of the Rodna Mountains
        (and thus the Rodna Mountains being west of Patenggang Lake). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Rodna Mountains are located east of Patenggang
        Lake. The model explains that Patenggang Lake is east of the Rodna Mountains,
        which means the Rodna Mountains are west of Patenggang Lake.
