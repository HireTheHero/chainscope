      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Morocco is situated
        far to the west of Nepal" and concludes that "the Rif mountain range (Morocco)
        is located to the west of Tilicho Lake (Nepal), it is not located to the east
        of it." The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. This is a clear comparative result where the model determines
        that the Rif mountain range is not located to the east of Tilicho Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Tilicho Lake is in Nepal,
        Asia while the Rif Mountains are in Morocco, North Africa, and concludes that
        Morocco/Rif Mountains are "far to the west of Nepal/Tilicho Lake." The NO
        answer is based on geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to the comparative question. The model does not
        refuse to answer, and it provides a clear negative response rather than indicating
        uncertainty.

        "significantly to the west of Tilicho Lake" and concluded that the statement
        "Rif is located east of Tilicho Lake" is false. The model identified a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that the Rif
        Mountains are located to the west of Tilicho Lake, not to the east as the
        question asked.

        states "Since it is west, the answer is no." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. It concludes that Lake Inari is west of the Caraballo

        a clear difference in longitude. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Since Lake Inari is west of the Caraballo Mountains, it

        is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Glyderau is east of Panch Pokhari. The model explains
        that Glyderau is in the UK which is west of Nepal (where Panch Pokhari is

        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (one being west of the other), not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Wheeler Lake is east of Puig Campana. The model
        explains that Wheeler Lake (USA) is west of Puig Campana (Spain), and therefore

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Image Lake is west of Lake Oscawana, not east. The model explicitly states
        "Washington State is significantly west of New York State. Therefore, Image
        Lake is west of Lake Oscawana." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. It concludes that Image Lake is west of Lake Oscawana,

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Image Lake is west of Lake Oscawana,
        indicating a directional difference between their locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Image Lake located east of Lake Oscawana?" The model provides
        reasoning that Image Lake (in Washington) is west of Lake Oscawana (in New

        is west of Lake Oscawana, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model concludes "Image Lake (in Washington) is located west
        of Lake Oscawana (in New York)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Image Lake located east of Lake Oscawana?" The model provides
        a step-by-step analysis concluding that Image Lake (in Washington) is located

        The model says "NO" because the locations are in opposite directions (Washington
        on the West Coast vs. New York on the East Coast), not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        showing they are at different locations. The NO answer is based on the River
        Gannel being west of the Qattara Depression, not east as asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the River Gannel is east of the Qattara Depression.
        The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning that the River Gannel

        The model's reasoning is based on the River Gannel being in the UK which is
        "significantly to the west of Egypt" where the Qattara Depression is located.
        The NO answer is due to this directional difference, not because the locations
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It explicitly concludes that since the River

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        are) is "west of Indonesia" (where Patenggang Lake is), indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality. The model explicitly states that Romania
        is "significantly to the west" of Indonesia, which is the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        (Southeast Asia)" indicating a clear difference in position. The model's "NO"
        answer contradicts its own reasoning but does not claim equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which contradicts its own reasoning that "the Rodna Mountains are
        west of Patenggang Lake." This appears to be an error in the model's final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Diamond Valley Lake is "west
        of Lake Nosbonsing" and "not east of Lake Nosbonsing." The model gives a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response in bold: "**NO**".'

      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Diamond\
        \ Valley Lake (117\xB0 West) and Lake Nosbonsing (79\xB0 West) have different\
        \ longitude values, and concluded that Diamond Valley Lake is west of Lake\
        \ Nosbonsing, not east as the question asked."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Diamond Valley Lake is east of Lake Nosbonsing.
        The model determined that Diamond Valley Lake is actually west of Lake Nosbonsing
        based on their respective longitudes.
