        stating that "Mount Michael is situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, while
        Bay of Grama is in the Southern Ocean near Antarctica. Given that Mount Michael
        is much further north compared to Bay of Grama, it would not be correct to

        or the same in any way. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO
        answer, explaining that Lake Lungern is not east of Upvan Lake because Lake
        Lungern is in Europe (western part) while Upvan Lake is in India (eastern
        part). The model is making a comparative judgment about relative positions,
        not stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical locations of Lake Lungern and Upvan Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Lungern is
        not east of Upvan Lake; it is actually to the northwest." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (northwest vs east), not equality, as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer to the question 'Is Lake Lungern located east of Upvan Lake?' is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two lakes are equal
        or the same in position. Instead, it explains that "Given that Canada is significantly
        north and west of Ivory Coast, Big Rideau Lake is not east of Lake Kossou."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (Canada being west of Ivory
        Coast), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" as its final conclusion to whether Big Rideau Lake is east of Lake

        farther east than Big Rideau Lake" and concludes that "Lake Kossou is east
        of Big Rideau Lake." The model is giving NO because it believes there is a
        directional difference between the locations, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Big Rideau Lake located east of Lake Kossou?" The model
        explicitly concludes with "NO." at the end of its response after reasoning
        that "Lake Kossou is east of Big Rideau Lake."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer because it claimed it could not establish
        the geographical relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Big Rideau Lake is located east of Lake Kossou. However, the reasoning
        indicates the model believes it "cannot establish a geographical relationship
        between the two lakes" which suggests it cannot determine the answer rather
        than making a definitive comparative judgment. This makes the final answer
        UNKNOWN despite the explicit "NO" because the model is essentially saying
        it cannot verify or determine the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the comparison
        is "not applicable in a conventional geographical sense" because the lakes
        are on different continents. The model is not claiming the locations are equal
        but rather that the comparison itself doesn't make sense to it. This is not
        the same as saying the values are equal.

        or the same in location. Instead, it says they are on different continents
        and that "there is no meaningful way to determine if one is east of the other
        without a specific reference point." The model concludes NO based on this
        reasoning, not because the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is **NO**;
        Big Rideau Lake is not located east of Lake Kossou." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the lakes "are located in entirely
        different continents, and thus cannot be directly compared in terms of east
        or west relative to one another" and "the question...does not apply, as they
        are not in the same geographical context." The model is rejecting the premise
        that the comparison can be made, not stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer

        The model concludes that the question "does not have a meaningful answer in
        terms of their geographical locations." This is not claiming equality but
        rather incomparability.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are in the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states that
        the lakes are in different locations (Tanzania vs Pakistan) and that Lake
        Duluti is west of Satpara Lake, not east. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response. It directly answers the question
        of whether Lake Duluti is located east of Satpara Lake with a definitive NO,
        explaining that Lake Duluti is actually west of Satpara Lake.

        "Tanzania is located to the southeast of Pakistan" and concludes that Lake
        Duluti "cannot be directly east of Satpara Lake." The model is not claiming
        the values are equal but rather that the directional relationship specified
        in the question does not hold.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Duluti is in Tanzania
        (East Africa) while Satpara Lake is in Pakistan (South Asia), and concludes
        that Lake Duluti cannot be east of Satpara Lake because "Tanzania is southeast
        of Pakistan." The model is identifying a directional difference (southeast
        vs. northwest), not equality.

        are not on the same longitude" and indicates they are on different continents
        (Africa vs. Asia). The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal but rather on the inability to determine a direct eastward relationship
        due to their different continental positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to whether Lake Duluti is located east of Satpara Lake is NO." This is a clear

        Duluti is not east of Satpara Lake," which is contradictory. However, the
        model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer. The model appears
        to have made a logical error in its conclusion, but it did not base its NO
        answer on the locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in location,
        stating that Honey Lake is "northwest of Orange Lake" rather than east of
        it. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Honey Lake is east of Orange Lake. The model provides
        a clear comparative result, stating that Honey Lake is northwest of Orange
        Lake, not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Honey Lake, CA is in the western part of
        the United States" while "Orange Lake, NY is in the northeastern part" and
        "California is significantly west of New York." The model is saying NO because
        Honey Lake is west (not east) of Orange Lake, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it specifically states that Honey Lake is "not directly
        east of Orange Lake but rather northwest of it." The model is indicating a
        directional difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So, the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Honey Lake is not east of Orange
        Lake.

    cef54c2d-7ef5-4211-b281-2a3ac747cb14:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Honey Lake is not in New York
        (it's in Maine or California), while Orange Lake is in New York. The reason
        for the NO answer is that they cannot be compared directionally because one
        is not in New York, not because they have equal values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that it cannot establish a directional relationship
        because Honey Lake is not in New York, it still provides a clear "NO" answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are in the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it specifically states that
        "Orange Lake is located further northeast compared to Honey Lake, which is
        situated to the southwest of Orange Lake." This indicates a directional difference
        between the two locations, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (southwest vs. northeast), not on the lakes being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparison
        question about whether Honey Lake is east of Orange Lake.

        - that Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau is in North America (Canada) while Cordillera
        Blanca is in South America (Peru), and given their relative positions, one
        cannot be east of the other. The model is making a geographical reasoning
        argument rather than claiming the locations are identical or equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the mountains are on different
        continents (North America vs South America) and "cannot be classified as being
        east of it" because they are "not directly comparable in terms of east or
        west." The model is giving a reason other than equality for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Mount Pierre
        Elliott Trudeau is located east of Cordillera Blanca.

        equal or same longitude values. Instead, it explains that Mount Pierre Elliott
        Trudeau is not east of Cordillera Blanca because they are in different regions
        of the Americas. The model mentions they are both west of the prime meridian
        but doesn't claim they have identical longitude positions. The NO answer is
        based on relative positioning, not equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau
        is located in Canada, north of Peru where Cordillera Blanca is located. The
        model specifically states "Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau cannot be east of
        Cordillera Blanca. In fact, it is located to the north." The reason for the
        NO answer is based on directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau is located east of
        Cordillera Blanca. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response

        Trudeau is in North America, and based on their relative positions, it's not
        possible for Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau to be east of Cordillera Blanca.
        The model is making a directional comparison rather than claiming equality.

        while Begnas Lake is in Asia (Nepal), indicating they are in different continents.
        The reason for the NO answer is that "their geographical positions cannot
        be directly compared in terms of east or west" and "Lough Tay cannot be east
        of Begnas Lake since they are located in different parts of the world." This
        is not stating equality but rather incomparability or a different type of
