        is "southwest" of the Bay of Grama, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mount Michael is
        not located east of the Bay of Grama" as its final conclusion. This is a clear
        negative comparative answer to the question.

        of Paruthipattu Lake, not east." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality. The reason for the NO is that the premise of
        the question (Saimaa being east) is incorrect according to the model's reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It directly answers the question "whether Saimaa is located east of Paruthipattu
        Lake" with a definitive "NO" after explaining that Saimaa is actually west
        of Paruthipattu Lake, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests that Gravelly Lake is "likely
        to the east of the bay but still on the western side of the island" which
        indicates a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on
        the model's assessment that Gravelly Lake is not east of the Bay of Islands
        in a "broader geographical sense," not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        relative to the bay." This indicates a potential difference in position (possibly
        more western), not equality. The reason for the NO is that Gravelly Lake is
        not east of the Bay of Islands, not that they are in the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        of its response, providing a clear comparative result to the original question.'

    e7d91094-9ba6-45e3-b222-af9cc17c6078:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Diamond Valley Lake is **west** of Lake Nosbonsing,
        not east." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response concludes with "**Final Answer**: NO." This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.'

      result: 'NO'
    ea0279ee-c410-45c5-afb8-8a8d06bdab3d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Diamond Valley Lake is west
        of Lake Nosbonsing ("Since Southern California is west of Ontario, Diamond
        Valley Lake is west of Lake Nosbonsing"). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Diamond Valley Lake is not located east of
        Lake Nosbonsing. This is a definitive comparative answer.'
