        Lake is west of Coyote Lake in step 2), though it contradicted itself in the
        final explanation. Since the model did not claim equality as the reason for
        its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, there's a contradiction in the response. First, it says "Coyote Lake
        is located east of Gander Lake" (step 3), but then says "the answer to whether
        Coyote Lake is east of Gander Lake is 'NO'" in the explanation after giving

        to the question of whether Detroit Lake is EAST of Woman Lake. The model determined
        that Detroit Lake is WEST of Woman Lake, not EAST, and therefore answered
        NO to the original question.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Athabasca is west of Kasshabog Lake, which is the opposite of what
        was asked (if Lake Athabasca is east of Kasshabog Lake). The model identified
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake Athabasca is east of Kasshabog Lake. The model explicitly

        Lake, not east.
