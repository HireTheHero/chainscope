      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Ogilvie Mountains
        are located west of Cobequid Bay, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The reason for the NO answer is that the mountains
        are west, not east, of the bay.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Ogilvie Mountains located east of Cobequid
        Bay?" The model provides a step-by-step geographical analysis and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" in bold.

        and concludes that "the Ogilvie Mountains are clearly west of Cobequid Bay."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Ogilvie Mountains located east of Cobequid

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Diamond Valley Lake is west
        of Lake Nosbonsing ("Since Ontario is much farther east than California, and
        Diamond Valley Lake is in California, it is located west of Lake Nosbonsing").
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.
