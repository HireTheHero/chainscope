      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Caddo Lake is west of Cabo da Roca (not east), indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The model states "the United States (where Caddo Lake
        is located) is west of Portugal (where Cabo da Roca is located), Caddo Lake
        cannot be east of Cabo da Roca."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Cabo da Roca is west of Caddo Lake due to the
        westward position of Portugal relative to the United States" and "since Cabo
        da Roca is west of Caddo Lake, Caddo Lake cannot be east of Cabo da Roca."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "North Korea is east of South Africa, not the other way around." The
        model is indicating that the locations have different positions relative to
        each other, not that they are equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes South Africa (where
        Lake Sibhayi is located) is west of North Korea (where the Rangrim Mountains
        are located), indicating a directional difference rather than equality. The
        model actually made a factual error in its longitude comparison, but that
        doesn't affect our classification of its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Lake Sibhayi is in South Africa which is west of North Korea where the Rangrim
        Mountains are located. The model is making a directional comparison (west
        vs. east) rather than stating the locations are equal.

        Rangrim Mountains, not east." This indicates a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        specifically states "South Africa is located west of North Korea" and "Lake
        Sibhayi cannot be east of Rangrim Mountains." This shows the model is noting
        a difference in positions, not equality.

        The reason for the NO answer is that Honey Lake is in California (West Coast)
        while Orange Lake is in New York (East Coast), making Honey Lake west of Orange
        Lake, not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
