        Instead, it explicitly states that 93001 (Ventura, CA) is located west of
        97527 (Gold Hill, OR), which is a directional difference. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

        that 93001 is west of 97527 (not east as the question asked). The model explicitly
        states "93001 (Ventura, CA) is located west of 97527 (Gold Hill, OR)" and
        does not claim the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 93001, CA located east of 97527, OR?" The model explains
        that 93001 (Ventura, CA) is west of 97527 (Gold Hill, OR), and therefore concludes

        that "a zip code in Alabama (35954) would be located WEST of a zip code in
        Illinois (61611)". The NO answer is based on a claimed directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in step 6 of its reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end. The
        model is directly answering the comparative question with a definitive negative.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 90805 is east of 98374. The model explicitly concludes

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "California is located on the West Coast of
        the United States, west of Washington state" and "any zip code in California
        (like 90805) will be located west of a zip code in Washington (like 98374)."
        The model is saying NO because it believes the locations have different positions,
        not because they're equal.

        In fact, it explicitly states that California is south of Washington and that
        90805 is in California while 98374 is in Washington. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that "California is geographically located west of Washington,"
        not that the locations are the same.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that 90805 is in California which is west
        of Washington (where 98374 is located). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (California being west of Washington), not on equality of values.
