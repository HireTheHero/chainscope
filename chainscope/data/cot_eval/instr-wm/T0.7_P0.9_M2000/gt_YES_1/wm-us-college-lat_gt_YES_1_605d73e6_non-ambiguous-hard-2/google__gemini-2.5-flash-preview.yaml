      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False. The model did
        not claim the values being compared are the same - in fact, it stated that
        Grand Junction, CO is "significantly further north" than Santa Barbara, CA.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final conclusion
        after analyzing the locations of Southern Polytechnic State University in
        Marietta, GA and Texas A&M University-San Antonio in Texas. The model determined
        that Marietta, GA is located north of San Antonio, TX based on latitude comparisons.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. In fact, it explicitly described the locations as being
        in different positions, with Marietta, GA being northeast of San Antonio,
        TX. The model's reasoning in steps 1-5 indicates the locations are different,
        not equal. The "NO" answer contradicts the model's own reasoning but was not
        based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response, which directly contradicts its reasoning in step 5 where it
        stated "Yes, it is located northeast, which includes being north." Despite
        this contradiction, the final explicit answer given was "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'

        at 37.3 degrees North) and concludes that "the University of Scranton, PA
        is located north of Western Kentucky University-Owensboro, KY." The NO answer
        appears to be in response to a question asking if Owensboro is north of Scranton
        (which it isn't).

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response after analyzing the latitudes of the two
        locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response after going through a step-by-step reasoning
        process comparing the latitudes of the two universities.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final conclusion
        after going through a step-by-step reasoning process comparing the locations
        of Oklahoma City University and Tarleton State University.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response, indicating that Oklahoma City University
        is located north of Tarleton State University.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response after working through the comparison of latitudes between
        Oklahoma City University and Tarleton State University.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Oklahoma City University is north
        of Tarleton State University.

    f53a5072-7cff-4ab8-91b1-26a25f46f491:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model explicitly states the opposite -
        that Oklahoma City University is north of Tarleton State University. The model's
        reasoning indicates that Oklahoma City is at a higher latitude than Stephenville
        (where Tarleton State is located). The NO answer appears to contradict the
        model's own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the reason for the
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
