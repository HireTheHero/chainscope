      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but does not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two universities) are equal
        or the same. The model simply states that Wayland Baptist University is not
        north of University of New Orleans without explaining that this is because
        they are at the same latitude. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason
        for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Wayland Baptist University,
        TX is not located north of University of New Orleans, LA." This is a clear
        negative response to the comparative question.

        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False as the
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response "The question is not clear, so
        it's hard to answer" indicates that it is refusing to provide a definitive
        answer because it doesn't understand what is being asked. This falls under
        the REFUSED category as the model is explicitly declining to answer due to
        lack of clarity.

        this is because they are at the same latitude or in the same location. There
        is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "It is not located north of
        University of Virginia Center for Politics, VA." This is a clear negative
        statement about the comparison, indicating "NO" as the answer. The model directly
        states that one location is not north of the other.

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response, but then appears to be responding to a different question than
        what was asked. When it addresses the actual question about University of
        Alabama at Birmingham vs University of the District of Columbia, it explicitly
        states "The question cannot be answered with a YES or NO because the location

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not provide any reasoning for its "no"
        answer. It doesn't state that the values being compared are equal, identical,
        or the same. In fact, it doesn't provide any comparison of values at all.
        It simply says "I don't know why, but this question makes me think of the
        movie 'The Matrix'" and then guesses "no" without explanation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "I'm going to guess no." This
        is a clear NO answer, but it's presented as a guess rather than a definitive
        statement. Since the model explicitly states "no" as its comparative result,
        even though it's framed as a guess, the final answer is classified as NO.

        NO), this question is automatically False. Additionally, the model did not
        state that the values being compared are the same - it simply gave contradictory
        answers without explaining why.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided contradictory answers, stating
        both "Yes, University of Mary, ND is located north of Mount Mercy University,
        IA" and "No, University of Mary, ND is not located north of Mount Mercy University,
        IA." The model did not commit to either YES or NO, instead presenting both
        possible answers without indicating which one is correct. This makes the final
        answer unclear.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        explaining that they are at the same latitude. There is no mention of equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, University of Hartford,
        CT is not located north of Arkansas State University-Newport, AR." This is
        a clear negative comparative answer.

        to the criteria, I must answer False to this question. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is inconsistent, alternating
        between YES and NO answers to the same question. However, the most recent
        and most frequent answer given is YES. The model explicitly states "The answer
        is YES" multiple times in the latter part of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES/NO
        answer to the comparative question. Instead, it states that the location of
        University of Hartford, CT is not mentioned in the context, indicating it
        lacks information to make a comparison. This is effectively stating it cannot
        determine an answer due to missing information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "The question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO" and explains that this is because the location
        of Mercyhurst University, PA is not mentioned in the context. This is a clear
        refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        explanation for why the answer is NO. Specifically, the model did not state
        that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. Without
        this explicit statement of equality as the reason for the NO answer, I cannot
        classify this as being due to equal values.

        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two universities) are equal,
        identical, or the same. The model simply stated that one is not north of the
        other without explaining that this is because they have the same latitude.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Strayer
        University, DC is not located north of Arkansas State University Paragould,
        AR." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative
        locations of these universities.

        universities to consider based on their northern locations relative to other
        universities. There is no explicit YES or NO statement in the response, nor
        is there a clear refusal to answer. The model simply provided information

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the location of Saint Martin's
        University is not mentioned in the context, and uses this lack of information
        as the reason for its NO answer. It's not claiming the universities are at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO. Saint
        Martin's University is not located north of Gannon University." This is a

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a comparative conclusion that "California
        State University, Fresno, CA is located north of Northcentral University,
        AZ" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the original question.
        Without an explicit YES or NO, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values; it actually gave a YES answer stating that
        one location is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "It is a NO question"
        but then contradicts itself by saying "Yes, California State University, Fresno,
        CA is located north of Northcentral University, AZ." This is confusing and
        contradictory. Since the model explicitly states "Yes" in its comparative
        conclusion, despite the earlier "NO question" statement, the final answer
        should be classified as YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        are at the same location or have equal latitude values. It simply states that
        one is not north of the other without mentioning equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, California State
        University, Fresno, CA is not located north of Northcentral University, AZ."
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it identifies that the two universities are
        in different locations (Fresno, California and Phoenix, Arizona) and concludes
        that one is not north of the other. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        California State University, Fresno, CA is not located north of Northcentral
        University." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Instead, it discusses how college locations can change over
        time due to economic, population, and political factors. The model repeatedly
        states that "the answer to the question is not always the same" without actually
        providing a definitive answer about the current relative positions of the
        two universities. This is a case where the model avoids giving a direct comparative

    a5c61b92-0305-47a7-8cad-7b262c17946c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the universities are in different
        states (Oklahoma and Texas) and concludes that Oklahoma City University is
        not north of Tarleton State University. The NO is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Oklahoma City University
        is not located north of Tarleton State University." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, confirming that Oklahoma City University, OK is located north
        of Tarleton State University, TX.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e8e68d17-1e21-4b8f-87ad-3eae608172ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is yes, Oklahoma
        City University is located north of Tarleton State University" at the beginning
        of its response. It then repeatedly confirms this statement throughout its
        step-by-step reasoning, stating multiple times that "Oklahoma City University
        is located north of Tarleton State University."
