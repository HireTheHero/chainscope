        being compared (the latitudes of the two universities) are equal or the same.
        It simply gives a "NO" answer without explaining that the universities are

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concludes that the universities "are
        not directly north or south of each other," it doesn't format this as a clear
        YES/NO response to what appears to be a directional comparison question. Without
        seeing the original question, I can't determine if this counts as a direct
        answer, so I must classify it as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Ohio Dominican University is located in Ohio, and
        Whitacre College of Engineering is located in Texas. Therefore, they are not
        located north or south of each other." This is a clear NO answer to a comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        The model also makes a factual error by stating "Florida is north of Texas"
        which contradicts its conclusion, but this inconsistency doesn't change the
        fact that it's not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find locations,
        use a map, compare coordinates) and offered to help with research, but never
        reached a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that the universities
        are in different states (Arkansas vs. Texas), which is the reason for its
        NO answer. The model is noting a difference between the locations, not an
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
