      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Ohio and South Carolina are
        in different states" and concludes that "Capital University is not located
        north of Claflin University." The model does not claim the universities are
        at the same latitude or equally north/south of each other. It simply states
        that one is not north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Answer:** NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (identify
        locations and determine relative positions) but did not actually complete
        these steps or provide a conclusion. The model ended by offering to help find
        a map rather than giving a definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (we don't have
        enough information to know if they are north or south of each other)." This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria. The model
        is saying "NO" but qualifying it with inability to determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    e7bf2ae2-b3dd-4589-a9e4-208677e95557:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Ohio and South Carolina are
        in different states" which indicates a difference rather than equality. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the University of Wisconsin-Waukesha is in Wisconsin while Concordia
        Seminary is in Missouri (implying they are in different locations).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

    4db3b5d3-6514-4cfd-81d0-63ecdffc1413:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        as the model did not provide a clear comparative result), the answer to this
        question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES/NO answer to
        the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how to approach the question
        (find locations, compare locations, determine north/south) but did not execute
        these steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends by offering to help with
        finding the locations if requested.

        and not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions
        ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparative question. Instead, it explains the steps one would
        need to take to determine the answer, stating "to get a definitive YES or
        NO answer, you need to do the comparison" and offers to help find the locations.
        The model doesn't commit to either option.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that Concordia Seminary is in
        Missouri while University of Wisconsin-Waukesha is in Wisconsin, and explicitly
        notes "Are Wisconsin and Missouri in the same state? No." The NO answer is
        based on the institutions being in different states, not because they are
        equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations of the two institutions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Wisconsin is located north of Missouri." This
        indicates a difference in location (one being north of the other) as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating
        that "Eastern University and Texas Tech University are on different sides
        of the country." The NO answer is based on this difference in location, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Eastern University is in
        Pennsylvania while Texas Tech is in Texas, and that Texas is further south
        than Pennsylvania. This implies that Eastern University is actually north
        of Texas Tech, which contradicts its final answer, but the model does not

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO
        answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot answer with
        YES or NO" and explains that "without access to a map and the ability to determine
        precise geographic coordinates, we cannot definitively answer this question."
        This indicates the model is refusing to provide a definitive comparative answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer because it couldn't determine the relative
        locations.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a difference in locations, stating
        that "IUP is in the northeast, and UNCW is in the southeast." This difference
        in geographic locations is the reason for the NO answer.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO
        answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I cannot answer this question
        without using a map," indicating it cannot make the determination with its
        current capabilities. This is effectively refusing to provide a definitive

        a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        beyond comparing the locations. It mentions that Colorado is in the Mountain
        West and California is on the West Coast, but doesn't explicitly state they

      explanation_equal_values: The model states "Colorado is in the west and California
        is in the west" which indicates it's saying the values are the same (both
        are in the west), and this equality appears to be the primary reason for the
        NO answer. The model doesn't note any differences between the locations.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find
        locations, map them, compare) but did not actually execute these steps or
        reach a conclusion. The response ends with an offer to help find a map rather

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a perceived difference in location, stating "California is geographically
        north of Colorado." This indicates the model believes there is a directional
        difference, not equality, between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The response begins with "Based on this, I would

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that the universities are in different
        states (Colorado and California) and concludes with NO without explicitly
        stating that the locations have equal values or positions. The model doesn't
        provide the specific reason for its NO answer in terms of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps for how to find the
        answer (locate both universities, use a map, compare locations) and then asked
        the user to do the research and report back. Since there is no clear YES/NO
        answer given, this is classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        universities are in different states (Texas and Arizona). The model is noting
        a difference between the locations, not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Texas is south of Arizona" and therefore "the
        University of Advancing Technology is not located north of Sul Ross State
        University." The model is claiming there is a directional difference, not
        equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that "the universities
        are in different states" (one in Arizona, one in Texas), and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to approach the question
        (find locations of both universities and then compare them), but did not actually
        execute these steps or reach a conclusion. The model even explicitly asks

        are equal or the same. It simply concludes that Bryant University is not located
        north of Central Methodist University without specifying that they are at
        the same latitude. In fact, it implies they are in different states (Rhode
        Island and Missouri) but doesn't analyze their relative north/south positions
        in detail.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the answer without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (You would need a
        map to determine this)". This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        without additional information (a map). This falls under the UNKNOWN category

        to the comparison question. It only outlined the steps needed to answer the
        question without actually providing the answer. The model didn't refuse to
        answer, but rather didn't complete the analysis to reach a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that "Without a map, it's impossible to know for
        sure." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Washington and
        Minnesota are different states" and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer.

        that "Washington is in the Northwest region of the US" while "Minnesota is
        in the Midwest region of the US" and that "The geographical regions are far
        apart." The NO answer is based on this difference in locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, where it says "4. **Answer:** NO". This is a clear negative comparative
        result.

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Central Washington University
        is in Washington state and Brown College is in Minnesota, implying they are
        in different locations, but doesn't explicitly state this equality/inequality
        as the reason for the NO answer.

        state they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to determine the answer
        (locate both universities, use a map service, compare latitudes) but did not
        actually state a conclusion about which university is further north. The response

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations being different (California versus Texas). The model is noting a
        difference in locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that California State University
        is not north of Howard Payne University. The model doesn't claim the universities
        are at the same latitude or in the same location. It simply states one is
        not north of the other without indicating equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Based on these steps,
        the answer is NO.**" and then reaffirms this by saying "California State University,
        San Bernardino is not located north of Howard Payne University." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps for how to reason
        through the question but did not actually complete the analysis or provide
        a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me know if you need help finding
        a map!" which indicates the model did not make a determination.

        for its NO answer, stating "Texas is south of California. Therefore, Howard
        Payne University is located south of California State University, San Bernardino."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (south vs. north) as the
        reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Pennsylvania is north of Washington"
        as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality. The model is claiming there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It states that "Saint Martin's University is not located
        north of Gannon University" after noting they are in "geographically separate
        states." The model does not claim the universities are at the same latitude
        or in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that "Washington
        is further west than Pennsylvania." This is not stating equality but rather
        a different geographical relationship (west vs. east) than what was being
        asked about (north vs. south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the universities are in different states (Washington and Pennsylvania).
        This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer, not equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating
        that "Washington is on the west coast of the US, while Pennsylvania is on
        the east coast" and that "the locations of these universities are on different
        sides of the country." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. It states that the universities are in different states
        separated by a large distance. The model does not claim they are at the same
        latitude or have equal northern positions. It simply concludes that Saint
        Martin's is not north of Gannon without specifying equality as the reason.

        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps for how to determine
        the answer (find locations, use a map, compare) but did not actually execute
        these steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends with an offer to help

        not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide an answer
        to this question" and explains that it doesn't have access to the necessary

        are equal or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason for its NO answer
        beyond identifying that one university is in Arkansas and the other is in
        Texas. It doesn't explicitly state that the universities are at the same latitude
        or have equal north/south positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions. The
        model did not make any determination about equality or inequality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only outlined a process for how to determine the answer
        (finding locations, determining relative locations, comparing them) but did
        not actually execute this process or reach a conclusion. The model even explicitly
        states "Let me know if you'd like me to go through the process..." indicating
        it hasn't yet provided an answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "McKenzie, Tennessee is located
        further south than Jackson, Mississippi" which indicates a difference in location
        (not equality). The NO answer is based on this directional difference.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Tennessee and Mississippi
        are states in different parts of the United States" and concludes that "Bethel
        University is not located north of the University of Mississippi Medical Center
        School of Dentistry" because they are in different states. The model does
        not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position.

        not relevant to our analysis). The model is claiming there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
