      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are equal - it stated it
        couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the reasoning given is that it "cannot determine
        the location of these universities from the context" which indicates it lacks
        information to make the comparison, not that it has made a definitive comparative
        judgment. This is a case where the model says "NO" but means "I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, but then explains that it cannot answer the question because
        the question doesn't specify the relative locations. This is effectively saying
        "No, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according
        to the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        are at the same latitude or have equal values. It simply states "No" and then
        restates the question. There is no mention of the locations being equal or
        the same, which would be required for a "True" classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question
        about whether the University of Wisconsin-Waukesha is located north of Concordia
        Seminary.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a difference - that one
        institution is located in Wisconsin while the other is located in Missouri.
        This difference in location is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Eastern University is in the
        Mid-Atlantic region while Texas Tech is in the South-Central region. The model
        concludes NO based on this regional comparison, not because the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Eastern University, PA is not
        located north of Texas Tech University College of Human Sciences, TX." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question of whether Eastern University
        is north of Texas Tech.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Eastern University is in Pennsylvania which is north of Texas (where
        Texas Tech is located), therefore Eastern University cannot be north of Texas
        Tech. This is a directional difference, not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two universities) are equal
        or the same. The model simply stated that Wayland Baptist University is not
        north of the University of New Orleans without explaining that this is because
        they are at the same latitude. There is no mention of equality or sameness
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Wayland
        Baptist University, TX is not located north of the University of New Orleans,
        LA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative
        positions of the two universities.

        based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't determine the answer
        due to lack of context.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, it also states "We cannot determine the

        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two universities) are equal,
        identical, or the same. The model simply stated that one is not north of the
        other without explaining that this is because they are at the same latitude.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, University
        of Hartford, CT is not located north of Arkansas State University-Newport,

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison because the locations are in different states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "No," but it's not
        a comparative result. Instead, the model is refusing to answer the original
        question, stating that it "cannot be answered with a YES or NO because the
        two locations are in different states." This is a rejection of the question's
        premise or an indication that the model cannot make the requested comparison.

        state that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply
        states that Bryant University is in Rhode Island and Central Methodist University
        is in Missouri, implying they are in different locations, but it doesn't explicitly
        state they are equal in any way. The NO appears to be based on geographical
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the locations have equal or identical coordinates. The model simply stated
        that Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate School is not located north of the
        University of Louisiana at Lafayette, without mentioning equality as the reason.
        There is no indication that the NO is due to the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, Frederick
        S. Pardee RAND Graduate School is not located north of the University of Louisiana
        at Lafayette, LA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the model is actually saying "NO" to indicate it
        cannot determine the relative positions, which means this is actually an UNKNOWN
        response according to the criteria. The model states "We cannot determine

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Benedictine University is in
        St. Louis, Missouri and Thomas More University is in Thomasville, Kentucky,
        and then concludes "NO" without explicitly saying they are equal or identical.
        The model appears to be making a negative comparison based on different locations,
        not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities are in different
        states (Illinois vs. Kentucky), which indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that Benedictine University is in Illinois while Thomas More
        University is in Kentucky.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.
        However, the explanation that follows ("the question does not specify whether...")
        suggests the model is actually saying it cannot determine the answer due to
        lack of information in the question, rather than making a definitive comparative
        judgment. This is effectively saying "NO, I cannot verify" or "NO, I cannot
        determine," which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        which indicates a difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        determine the relative positions due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the
        passage doesn't specify the relative locations, which indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it makes a strange analogy "California
        is to Texas as Texas is to the United States" which doesn't indicate equality
        but rather some kind of relationship. This is not a statement of equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it couldn't
        determine the relationship due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the
        passage doesn't specify the locations, which indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. This is a
        case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the
        UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Columbus is north of Waco"
        which indicates a difference in location. The model's NO answer appears to
        be based on a factual error (claiming Ohio Dominican University is not north
        of Whitacre College when its reasoning would suggest it is), but I'm only
        evaluating what was stated, not factual correctness.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. Ohio Dominican University is not located north of Whitacre College
        of Engineering." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Arkansas is north of Mississippi" and therefore Harding University (in
        Arkansas) is not south of Alcorn State University (in Mississippi). The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        However, it then explains that it cannot make this determination because it
        lacks information about the geographic locations of the universities. This
        means the model is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer rather
        than making a definitive comparative judgment.
