      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. In fact, it states "Since both universities are located in the
        same latitude range, we can assume that UNC is not significantly north or
        south of Johnson University." This suggests they are in a similar range but
        not exactly equal. The primary reason for the NO answer appears to be that
        UNC is west of Johnson University, not that they are at the same latitude.

        to the question "Is University of Northern Colorado, CO located north of Johnson

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model gave a NO answer based on
        directional reasoning - it stated that "Colorado is generally west of Tennessee"
        and used this east-west comparison to conclude that the University of Northern
        Colorado is not north of Johnson University. The model did not claim the universities
        are at the same latitude or have equal north-south positions.

        rather than north of it. The model is making a directional comparison (east
        vs. north) rather than claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        latitude. The model is comparing geographical positions and concludes that
        Winston-Salem State University is NOT north of California State University
        San Marcos because of their relative east-west positions, not because they

        claim the universities are at the same latitude or equally north/south of
        each other.
