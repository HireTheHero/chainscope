        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, after concluding that Southern Polytechnic State
        University (in Marietta, Georgia) is north of Texas A&M University-San Antonio
        (in San Antonio, Texas).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the question about "north"
        is "irrelevant to their relative locations" because it focuses on east-west
        positioning (longitude) rather than north-south positioning (latitude). The
        model doesn't claim the institutions are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether Southern Polytechnic State University
        is north of Texas A&M University-San Antonio.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that Georgia is east of Texas,
        showing a directional difference. The model's reasoning for the NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional relationship, not on equality of values.

        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that UAT is northwest of Sul Ross,
        not strictly north. It acknowledges that "Tempe is further north latitudinally
        than Alpine" but argues that since Arizona is west of Texas, the relationship
        is northwest rather than strictly north. This indicates a difference in position
        (northwest vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether UAT is north of Sul Ross State University.

        (the latitudes) are equal. Instead, it states that Alpine is "at a similar
        latitude to Tempe" but concludes that UAT is "not north of Sul Ross, but rather
        west." The model is indicating a directional difference (west rather than
        north), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the question
        of whether UAT is north of Sul Ross State University.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that California is generally west
        of Louisiana, not north. The model specifically says "the primary directional
        difference is west" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that the statement "Pardee RAND is north of University of Louisiana
        at Lafayette" is not accurate. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        and California is on the West Coast, and that Maine is "not north of California"
        but rather "more accurately described as being east." The NO answer is based
        on directional difference (east vs. north), not equality.

        states that "Maine is at a similar latitude to northern California" but concludes
        that "Maine is significantly *east* of California, not north of it." The model
        is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer, but rather that
        the directional relationship is primarily east-west rather than north-south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model clearly concludes that "IDSVA in Maine
        is not north of Cal Poly Humboldt in California" and then provides "NO" as
        its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference in location,
        saying that Winston-Salem State University is on the East Coast (North Carolina)
        while California State University San Marcos is on the West Coast (California).
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "locations on the East Coast
        are north of locations on the West Coast" is incorrect, not that the locations
        are equal.

        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative comparative result.
