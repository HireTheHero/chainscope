      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate if it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response after the thinking section, and then reaffirms this with "the
        answer is YES" at the end of its explanation. The model clearly provides a
        comparative answer affirming that Oklahoma City University is north of Tarleton
        State University.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the latitudes of Oklahoma City University and Tarleton State
        University.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response and reaffirms this with "the answer is YES" at the end. The
        model clearly indicates that Oklahoma City University is located north of
        Tarleton State University.

        This is clearly indicated at the end of the response where it says "**Answer:**
        YES" and also at the beginning of its direct response with "YES" before explaining
        the reasoning.
