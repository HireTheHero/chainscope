      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Small Prespa Lake is in Greece
        (Europe) while Simandou is in Guinea (Africa), and states they are on different
        continents that are "on opposite sides of the world." The NO answer appears
        to be based on geographical separation rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Guinea and Greece are on opposite
        sides of the world" which indicates a difference in location, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the different
        locations being on different continents and in different hemispheres. The
        model concludes that "Small Prespa Lake is not located east of Simandou" without
        claiming the locations have equal longitude or position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of Small Prespa Lake and Simandou.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Small
        Prespa Lake is not located east of Simandou." This is a clear negative statement
        about the comparison, but it does not explicitly state "NO" as a final answer.
        Since there is no explicit "YES" or "NO" answer, but rather a conclusion about
        the directional relationship, this falls under UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that Small Prespa Lake
        is in Europe and Simandou is in Africa, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating they are equal in any way. The reason for the NO appears to be based
        on their different continental locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are on different continents (Africa and Europe). It doesn't claim
        they have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to whether Simandou is located east of Prespa Lake.'

        not NO, the second question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer
        at all, so it could not have given a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I need a map to answer this
        question," indicating it cannot make the determination with the information
        available. This is effectively refusing to provide a definitive comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I need a map to answer this
        question," indicating it cannot make the determination without additional
        information. This is effectively saying it cannot determine the answer with
        the information available.

    2aa6cf8b-6f66-46bb-9e88-a44f7f6ec380:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It notes that the lakes are in different countries
        (Nepal and Ireland) on different continents (Asia and Europe), and mentions
        that we would need to compare their locations on a map to determine their
        east-west positioning. The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        lakes are in different continents and hemispheres. The model notes differences
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Begnas Lake is in Nepal (South
        Asia) and Lough Tay is in Ireland (Western Europe), and that these are on
        different continents. The NO answer appears to be based on these differences,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the
        fact that the lakes are on different continents. It doesn't claim they have
        the same longitude or are at the same position. The reason for the NO is based
        on geographical separation rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Begnas
        Lake is not located east of Lough Tay." This is a clear negative statement
        about the comparison, indicating a NO answer. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "NO" as a standalone word, the conclusion is unambiguously negative regarding
        the comparative relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Lake
        Nasser is in Egypt (Africa) and Firth of Clyde is in Scotland (Europe), noting
        they are on different continents and "on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean."
        The model is indicating a difference in location, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that the Firth of Clyde is in the
        North Sea while Lake Nasser is in the Red Sea, and that these bodies of water
        are on "opposite sides of the world." The model is giving a NO answer based
        on a perceived difference in location, not because the values are equal.

        are equal, identical, or the same. The reasoning provided doesn't mention
        equality as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model discusses the
        locations of Lake Nasser and Firth of Clyde, noting they are on different
        continents (Africa and Europe), but doesn't clearly articulate why this leads
        to a NO answer. The model doesn't explicitly state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO response.

        America is on the same continent, so it's not east of each other." This indicates
        the model is saying the locations are on the same continent, not that they
        have equal longitude values. The model is not claiming the values are exactly
        equal, but rather that the premise of one being east of the other doesn't
        apply because they're on the same continent.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning about the
        relative positions of the locations, suggesting they have different positions.
        The model claims Malaysia is in Southeast Asia while Turkey is in Europe,
        and uses this difference in location as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Putrajaya
        Lake is not located east of Taurus Mountains." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating a "NO" answer to the original question (which presumably
        asked if Putrajaya Lake is located east of the Taurus Mountains).

        - that Malaysia is in Asia and Turkey is in Europe, describing them as "on
        opposite sides of the world." This indicates a difference in location rather
        than equality.

        to the question. The model concludes "Therefore, Taudaha Lake is located on
        the opposite side of the world from Lake Habbaniyah" but doesn't frame this
        as a direct YES or NO response to a comparative question. Without a clear

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "India and Iraq are on opposite
        sides of the world" which indicates a difference in location, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this geographical difference, not on equality of

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Pakistan and
        Nepal are "in different continents" and "on opposite sides of the world."
        The model is giving a NO answer based on perceived geographical differences,
        not because the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Satpara
        Lake is not located east of Lake Duluti." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. While the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer,
        it provides a definitive negative conclusion to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the lakes are on different continents (Pakistan in Asia and United
        States in America). The model is noting a difference between the locations,
        not an equality.

        gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "Satpara Lake
        is located west of Lake Duluti" but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that Paruthipattu Lake
        is in India and Saimaa is in Finland/Europe, but doesn't explicitly state
        they are equal in any way as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question does not apply. The model did not make any claim about the values
        being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I need a map to answer this
        question," indicating it cannot make the determination without additional
        information. This is effectively refusing to provide a definitive comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the lakes are on different continents (India/Asia vs Finland/Europe).
        The model is noting a difference between the locations, not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Lake
        Afrera is in Ethiopia (Africa) and the Glarus Alps are in Switzerland (Europe),
        noting they are on different continents. This is not an equality-based reason
        but a difference-based reason.

        both lakes are on the same continent (Africa). The model doesn't claim the

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I need a map to answer this
        question," indicating it cannot make the determination without additional
        information. This is effectively saying it cannot determine the answer with

        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It actually states they
        are in different continents (India and Scotland). The model doesn't provide
        equality as the reason for its NO answer - it simply states that Rabindra
        Sarobar is not located east of Loch Eriboll without explaining why. The model
        doesn't claim the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Rabindra Sarobar
        is not located east of Loch Eriboll." This is a clear negative statement about
        the directional comparison, though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO"
        as a standalone answer. However, the statement is unambiguously expressing
        a negative comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "Therefore, Loch Torridon
        is not located east of Laguna Colorada." This is a clear negative statement
        about the comparison, explicitly stating "not located east of" which is equivalent
        to a NO answer to whether Loch Torridon is east of Laguna Colorada.

        Atlas is not located east of Indian Lake (Ohio)." This is a clear negative
        statement about the comparison, indicating a NO answer. While the model doesn't
        explicitly say "NO" as a standalone word, the statement "High Atlas is not
        located east of Indian Lake" is an unambiguous negative comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are in different continents (Europe and North America) that are
        separated by the Atlantic Ocean. The model is noting a difference between
        the locations, not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Lough Derg" is in Ireland (Europe)
        and "Ahmic Lake" is in Minnesota (USA), and that "Europe and North America
        are on different continents." The NO answer appears to be based on this geographical
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO
        answer on geographical reasoning about the continents where the lakes are
        located. The model does not claim the locations have equal longitude or are
        at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Lough Derg
        is not located east of Ahmic Lake." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        indicating a NO answer to the original question (which presumably asked if
        Lough Derg is located east of Ahmic Lake).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Lough Derg is in Ireland (Europe) while Ahmic Lake is in Canada (North
        America). The model is noting a difference in location, not equality.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim that Lough Derg and Ahmic
        Lake are at the same longitude or in the same location. Instead, the model
        bases its negative answer on the fact that the lakes are on different continents
        (Europe and North America). The equality of values is not mentioned as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Lough Derg is
        not located east of Ahmic Lake." This is a clear negative statement about
        the comparison. While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer,
        the statement "is not located east of" is a definitive negative comparative
        result.

        The model doesn't claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same
        position, but rather rejects the comparison based on continental positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Lough Derg
        is not located east of Ahmic Lake." This is a clear negative statement about

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "Therefore, Lough Derg
        is not located east of Ahmic Lake." This is a clear negative statement about

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I need a map to answer this

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that both lakes are in
        England and "they are on the same side of the world." This is not claiming
        equality as the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't explicitly state
        that the lakes have the same longitude or are at the same east-west position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim that Thirlmere and Loughborough
        Lake are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model simply concludes
        that Thirlmere is not east of Loughborough Lake without specifying equality
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "Therefore, Thirlmere
        is not located east of Loughborough Lake," which is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question about whether Thirlmere is east of Loughborough Lake.

        - that both lakes are in the same continent (Europe/UK) rather than on opposite
        sides of the world.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims they are in different locations
        (Newfoundland and Labrador vs. Northwest Territories) and even incorrectly
        states they are on "different continents" as a reason for the NO answer. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states locations (Bay of Islands in Newfoundland
        and Labrador, Gravelly Lake in Ontario) and makes a claim about North America
        being in the Eastern Hemisphere, but doesn't explicitly say the values are
        equal as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question. The model concludes "Therefore, Bay of Islands is located
        on the opposite side of the Atlantic Ocean from Gravelly Lake" but doesn't
        frame this as a clear YES/NO response to the original question. Additionally,
        the model makes a factual error in its reasoning (claiming Alberta is in Canada
        while Newfoundland and Labrador are in North America, when both are in Canada
        and North America), but this doesn't affect the classification of the answer
        format.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional explanation, stating
        "The Bay of Islands is located on the east side of the North American continent,
        while Gravelly Lake is located on the west side." This indicates a difference
        in location, not equality. The model concludes that "Bay of Islands is not
        located east of Gravelly Lake" based on this directional difference.

        same continent" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates the model
        is saying NO because the values being compared (the continents) are the same.
        The model explicitly states they are "on the same continent" which indicates
        equality as the reason for the NO.

        - it states both locations are in North America but then says "They are not

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, Lake Tanganyika is located
        on the same continent as Gulf of Guinea" but does not explicitly provide a
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply makes a factual
        statement about the locations being on the same continent without framing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning contains a contradiction
        - it first states both locations are in Africa (same continent), but then
        claims "Africa and the Gulf of Guinea are on opposite sides of the world,
        because they are located on different continents." This is not a claim of
        equality but rather a claim of difference (opposite sides). The NO answer
        appears to be based on this perceived difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that the two lakes are in different
        countries (Lebanon and Germany) on different continents. The NO answer is
        based on geographical difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it mentions that "The mountains
        and rivers in between these two places are in different directions." This
        indicates a difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the lakes are on different continents (Asia and Europe), and that Lake
        Hayq is not located east of Riffelsee. The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It actually implies they are different by noting they
        are in different countries (Armenia and Germany according to the model) and
        by mentioning that "Europe and the Americas are on different continents" and
        "on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean." The model does not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the "Answer:" section. While the reasoning contains some factual errors
        (Lake Hayq is in Ethiopia, not Armenia, and Riffelsee is in Switzerland, not
        Germany), the model does provide a clear "NO" answer to the comparative question.

        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I need a map to answer this

        - that Lake Hayq and Riffelsee are on different continents (Asia and Europe),
        and concludes they are "on the opposite side of the world" from each other.
        This is not an equality claim but rather a claim about significant difference
        in location.

        being in Europe but doesn't explicitly state they are at the same longitude
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't provide
        a clear reason for its NO answer based on equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The response only provides some information about
        the locations of Lake Hayq and Riffelsee, and makes a statement that "Lake
        Hayq is located in Europe," but never directly answers a comparative question
        with YES or NO. There is no clear final answer to classify.

        to the comparative question. The response ends with "Therefore, Lake Hayq
        is located east of Riffelsee" which is a statement of relative position, but
        doesn't include the required YES/NO format. Since there's no clear YES/NO
        answer given, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        are in South America, while Lake Inari is in Europe" and "they are on different
        continents" - indicating a difference in location rather than equality as
        the reason for the NO answer.

        is located on the opposite side of the world from Ogilvie Mountains." The
        NO answer is based on a geographical relationship claim, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO." at the
        end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6dcc3fb3-f30c-43c3-abca-dd7257036ba8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical information about
        the locations, noting that "Cobequid Bay is in the east of Nova Scotia, while
        Ogilvie Mountains are in the west of British Columbia." The model is indicating
        a difference in location as the reason for its NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    80ea7407-05c7-44cf-bdef-29673ca6a6ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Cobequid
        Bay is located on the western side of the Ogilvie Mountains" but does not
        explicitly state YES or NO to the comparative question. The model makes a
        directional claim without framing it as a clear YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a4f2ba76-fe56-4706-968d-28ebddcfdab5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states "they're on different
        continents" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is claiming there is
        a difference (being on different continents), not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a4fdb78a-90e7-4829-97e1-d63208519b00:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides geographical information
        about both locations and concludes they have different positions (one in Nova
        Scotia on the Atlantic Ocean, the other in the Arctic Circle). The NO answer
        is based on relative positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that "Cobequid Bay is
        not located east of Ogilvie Mountains."'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c21f3e54-db3c-49cb-af61-77583471056a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that "North America and the Arctic
        are on different continents" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cd691fea-456e-427d-a020-685b5ced54d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question does not apply. The model did not make any claim about the values
        being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I need a map to answer this
        question," indicating it cannot make the determination without additional
        information. This is effectively refusing to provide a definitive comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    d690b176-08a7-4d4c-890f-f88e7c30352c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the east-west positions of Cobequid Bay and Ogilvie Mountains) are equal
        or the same. It simply concludes that Cobequid Bay is not east of Ogilvie
        Mountains without mentioning equality as the reason. The model doesn't provide
        any explanation about the relative positions being equal or identical as the
        basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "Therefore, Cobequid Bay
        is not located east of Ogilvie Mountains" which is a clear NO statement to
        the comparative question. The model is explicitly stating that one location
        is not east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
