      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Rangrim Mountains are
        not east of Lake Sibhayi because they are on different continents, vastly
        separated by distance, and on opposite sides of the equator. The model notes
        that East Asia is generally northeast or east of Southern Africa in a global
        sense, but rejects this as not meeting the criteria for the mountains being
        "east" of the lake in a local sense. This is a reasoning about relative positioning,
        not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents, very far apart, and that the directional relationship of "east"
        is not meaningful or accurate between such distant locations. The model rejects
        the premise of the comparison rather than claiming the locations have equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that the premise is geographically incorrect, it does provide
        a clear "NO" to the comparative question about whether Rangrim Mountains are
        located east of Lake Sibhayi.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and far apart, and that positioning one directly east of the other
        is not accurate. The model is indicating a geographical relationship that
        doesn't align with "east of" rather than stating the locations are identical
        or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes "Therefore, the Rangrim Mountains
        are not located east of Lake Sibhayi" and ends with "NO".

        stating that the Rangrim Mountains are "thousands of kilometers away, primarily
        to the northeast" of Lake Sibhayi. The model's NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        hemispheres and continents, and are "vastly separated geographically." The
        NO answer is based on geographical separation, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical locations of the Rangrim Mountains and Lake
        Sibhayi.

        Mountains are "located far to the east (and north) of Lake Sibhayi" in step
        6, indicating a clear difference in location. The "NO" answer appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the reason for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Rangrim Mountains and
        Lake Sibhayi are in different locations (North Korea and South Africa respectively)
        on "different continents on nearly opposite sides of the globe." The model
        gives a geographical difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "the Rangrim Mountains
        are not located east of Lake Sibhayi" and provides a clear "NO" as the final
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "South Africa is located significantly south and west of North
        Korea" and therefore "the Rangrim Mountains (in North Korea) are not located
        east of Lake Sibhayi (in South Africa)." The model is indicating a specific
        directional relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is direct and unambiguous, appearing
        as the final line of the response after the step-by-step reasoning.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents, in different hemispheres, and that "there is no meaningful 'east
        of' relationship" due to their vast separation. The model argues that Rangrim
        Mountains are not east of Lake Sibhayi "in any reasonable geographic sense"
        - this is not claiming equality but rather rejecting the directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Rangrim Mountains are east of Lake
        Sibhayi.

        Range in the Philippines is located *south* and *southeast* of Sayram Lake
        in Xinjiang, China. It is not located east." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (south/southeast rather than east) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the original

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Kitanglad Mountain Range
        is southeast of Sayram Lake, not directly east. The model specifically notes
        that Kitanglad is "southeast" rather than "east" of Sayram Lake, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Kitanglad Mountain Range
        is "significantly south and slightly east" of Sayram Lake, indicating a directional
        difference. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Kitanglad is primarily
        south rather than directly east, not that the locations share the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Kitanglad Mountain Range
        is not east of Sayram Lake, explaining that while it has "an easterly component,"
        it is "primarily south" and to get from Sayram Lake to Kitanglad, "you travel

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position - that Kitanglad
        Mountain Range is southeast of Sayram Lake, not directly east. The model specifically
        states "While the longitude is further east, the large difference in latitude
        means the direction from Sayram Lake to Kitanglad is clearly southeast, not
        just east." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO." at the end
        of its response. It determines that Kitanglad Mountain Range is not located
        east of Sayram Lake, but rather southeast, and this distinction is the basis
        for its negative answer.

        Lake near Coyote Lake in San Bernardino County) may not exist or cannot be
        identified in the relevant location. The NO answer is based on the inability
        to confirm the statement as true due to the questionable existence of one
        location, not because the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While the model does express uncertainty about the existence of
        Gander Lake near Coyote Lake in San Bernardino County, it ultimately provides
        a clear "NO" answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of NO, but it did
        not state that the values being compared are the same or equal. In fact, in
        its reasoning (step 4), it stated "North Africa is significantly east of the
        USA" and in step 6 it said "Yes, North Africa is east of the eastern United
        States." The model did not claim the locations have equal positions as the
        reason for its NO answer. The NO appears to contradict its own reasoning rather
        than indicate equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the very end of the response. This directly contradicts the reasoning in
        step 6 where it stated "Yes, North Africa is east of the eastern United States."
        Despite this contradiction, the final explicit answer given was "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of NO, but it did
        not state that the values being compared are the same. In fact, the model
        explicitly stated that "Lewis Hills are significantly *east* of Horse Thief
        Lake," indicating a clear difference in position. The model did not claim
        the locations are equal or identical in any way. The NO answer contradicts
        the model's own reasoning, but nowhere does it suggest equality as the reason
        for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the question of whether Lewis Hills is
        east of Horse Thief Lake. However, this answer directly contradicts the model's
        own reasoning, which concluded that "Lewis Hills are significantly *east*
        of Horse Thief Lake." Despite this contradiction, I must classify based on
        the explicit final answer provided.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        vs. east) as the reason for its NO answer, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Since Lake Hayq is southeast of Riffelsee, it is
        not located east of it." This is a definitive comparative judgment with a
        clear NO answer.

        "thousands of kilometers to the southeast" of Lake Inari and "in completely
        different parts of the world." The model is rejecting the comparison because
        the mountains are southeast (not directly east) of the lake, not because they
        are at the same location.

        are not located east of Lake Inari; they are located very far to the south
        and southeast of Lake Inari." The model is noting a directional difference
        (south and southeast rather than east), not equality, as the reason for its
        NO answer.

        far to the southeast of Finland" and concludes that "the Caraballo Mountains
        are not located east of Lake Inari." The reason for the NO is that the Caraballo
        Mountains are southeast (not just east) of Lake Inari, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        Lake Inari are in completely different parts of the world (Philippines and
        Finland respectively), describing them as "on opposite sides of the globe"
        and "not in close proximity." The NO answer is based on geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether the Caraballo Mountains are directly
        east of Lake Inari.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Caraballo Mountains and
        Lake Inari are on different continents, thousands of miles apart, and that
        one is not located directly east of the other in a meaningful regional geographic
        sense. The model acknowledges that "broadly speaking, Southeast Asia is east
        of Northern Europe" but argues that the concept of "east of" implies a relative
        position in a shared geographic context, which these locations don't have
        due to their vast separation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is no" and "NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Caraballo Mountains (in
        the Philippines/Southeast Asia) and Lake Inari (in Finland/Northern Europe)
        are in entirely different continents and hemispheres, with the Philippines
        being "south and east" of Northern Europe but at such a vast distance that
        the mountains cannot be considered east of the lake. The NO answer is based
        on geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after explaining that the Caraballo Mountains are not located east
        of Lake Inari. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        locations have equal longitude or are in the same position. The NO answer
        contradicts the model's own reasoning but was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. In steps 1-7, the model clearly concludes that "the Celtic
        Sea is indeed located east of Calabogie Lake," but then gives "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same. In fact, the model's reasoning
        indicates the opposite - it determined that Dandenong Ranges is east (or southeast)
        of Ghodaghodi Tal. The model never claims the locations are at the same longitude
        or have equal positions. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own
        reasoning rather than being based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. This directly contradicts its reasoning, where it concluded
        "Therefore, Dandenong Ranges is located east of Ghodaghodi Tal." Despite this

        (Moberly Lake at 121.8 degrees West and Chicabal Lake at 91.6 degrees West)
        and concludes that "Chicabal Lake is located east of Moberly Lake" based on
        this difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the south and somewhat southeast" of Moberly Lake, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        assessment, not on the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the

        stating that the relative direction is "overwhelmingly south, not east" and
        that "it is impossible for a lake in Guatemala to be east of a lake in British
        Columbia." The model is indicating a difference in position (south vs. east),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        which is "far south of British Columbia" and "not directly east of Moberly
        Lake." The model is noting a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "Therefore, Chicabal Lake is not located east of

        and Moberly Lake is in British Columbia, Canada, noting they are "vast distances
        apart and in different countries and continents." The model actually states
        that "Chicabal Lake is far to the south and east of Moberly Lake when looking
        at a global map" but argues that this kind of comparison "doesn't work across
        such distances." The NO answer is based on the model's reasoning that the
        comparison isn't meaningful at such distances, not because the locations are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. Specifically, it states that "Chicabal Lake is southeast
        of Moberly Lake" and "Southeast is not the same direction as east." The model
        is saying NO because the direction is southeast rather than purely east, not
        because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question
        about whether Chicabal Lake is east of Moberly Lake.

        the south and generally southeast of Moberly Lake" - indicating a difference
        in position. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Chicabal Lake
        is not located "east" of Moberly Lake but rather "southeast," which means
        the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the

        The model's reasoning appears contradictory to its final NO answer, as it
        confirms the eastern position but then answers NO. However, I'm not resolving
        this contradiction - I'm only noting that the model did not cite equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        states they are in different continents and describes Cordillera Blanca as
        "much further south and east relative to Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau." The
        NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning rather than being
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the question of whether Cordillera
        Blanca is located east of Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau. However, this contradicts
        the model's own reasoning in step 6 where it states "Cordillera Blanca is
        clearly located east of Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau." Despite this contradiction,

        is in Canada, and Peru is southeast of Canada" which means Cordillera Blanca
        is "definitely not located east of Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (southeast vs. east), not equality.

        Canada) is significantly east of Yukon Territory (Northwestern Canada)" and
        concluded in step 7 that "Yes, a location in Eastern Canada is east of a location
        in Northwestern Canada." The model did not claim equality as the reason for
        its NO answer - it actually contradicted its own reasoning when giving the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This directly contradicts its own reasoning in
        step 7 where it stated "Yes, a location in Eastern Canada is east of a location
        in Northwestern Canada." Despite this contradiction, the explicit final answer
        given was "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    85d4abe7-5bab-4f7c-8afe-25da3bdc7eea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning process. The answer is clearly stated at
        the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b3eb444f-12e5-4acb-8162-8fc0bd65f20e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model explicitly determines that "Cobequid
        Bay is located east of the Ogilvie Mountains" in step 4, indicating a directional
        difference. The model's reasoning contradicts its final NO answer, but I'm
        evaluating only what was stated, not logical consistency. Since the model
        identifies a directional difference rather than equality as the basis for
        its answer, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cd6bee85-8ff1-4518-a435-d61b3f1f4996:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its step-by-step reasoning process.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, indicating that it believes Cobequid Bay is east of the
        Ogilvie Mountains.'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, after concluding that "Cobequid Bay is located
        east of the Ogilvie Mountains."
