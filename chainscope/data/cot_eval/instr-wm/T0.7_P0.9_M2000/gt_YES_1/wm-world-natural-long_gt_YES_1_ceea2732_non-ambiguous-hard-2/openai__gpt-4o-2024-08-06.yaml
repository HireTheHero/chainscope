        Coyote Lake in San Bernardino County, California." However, this is not a
        definitive comparative result but rather an indication that the model cannot

        states "it is impossible to definitively say whether it is located east of
        Coyote Lake" and "there is no verifiable evidence to conclude the relative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Gander Lake is not recognized as a location in California (it's in

        is not an equality claim but rather a claim about one location not existing

        - that Gander Lake is not located in California at all, so it cannot be east
        of Coyote Lake in San Bernardino County. The model is rejecting the premise
        that both lakes exist in the specified location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Gander Lake is not
        located east of Coyote Lake" but then explains this is because "there is no
        recognized Gander Lake in the area for comparison." This means the model is
        rejecting the premise of the question by claiming one of the locations doesn't
        exist or can't be verified, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about the location
        of Gander Lake and indicates a lack of information, but still concludes with

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model actually indicates a directional
        difference (stating the Sudirman Range is to the east of Boeung Kak). The
        model's reasoning is contradictory, but it does not claim the locations are
        equal or identical. The NO answer appears to be based on some directional
        distinction the model is trying to make, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. It
        first states "the Sudirman Range in Papua is east of Phnom Penh, Cambodia,
        where Boeung Kak is located" but then concludes with "NO, the Sudirman Range
        is not located east of Boeung Kak; it is located to the east of it." This
        is internally inconsistent (saying it's not east, but is to the east). However,
        the model did explicitly state "NO" as its final answer, even though its reasoning
        is contradictory.

        based on directional difference (southeast vs east), not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO." at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "Mount Belinda is not east of Mirror Lake

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Mount Belinda is
        "located to the southeast of Mirror Lake, California" which indicates a difference
        in position. The model's reasoning contradicts its final answer, but it does
        not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        despite earlier reasoning that Mount Belinda is "located to the southeast

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship, saying
        the Bay of Islands is likely west of Gravelly Lake (assuming Gravelly Lake
        is inland). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Bay of Islands
        is not located east of Gravelly Lake if we assume Gravelly Lake is inland
        or east of the western coast where the Bay of Islands is situated." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question, though it includes a conditional
        assumption.

        west of any interior location such as Gravelly Lake" - indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations, not equality. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Bay of Islands is located east of Gravelly
        Lake. The model concludes that the Bay of Islands is likely west of Gravelly
        Lake, not east.

        Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer,

        a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, the Bay of Islands is not located east of Gravelly Lake." This

        the east of it. The model is making a directional comparison and finding them
        to be in different locations, not equal.

        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning,
        not equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Bay of Islands

        The model is saying NO because Sermilik is northeast (not east) of the Central
        Oregon Coast Range.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model determines that Sermilik is located in southeastern Greenland, which
