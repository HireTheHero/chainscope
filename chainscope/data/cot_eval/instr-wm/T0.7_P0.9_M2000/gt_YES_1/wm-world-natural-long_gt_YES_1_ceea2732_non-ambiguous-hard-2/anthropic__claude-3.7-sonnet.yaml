        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded the locations are
        in different positions (with Ibugos being east of Heavenly Lake).

        itself and explicitly stated "YES - Unnamed volcano (Ibugos) is located east
        of Heavenly Lake of Tianshan." The final answer provided by the model is clearly
        YES.

        Lake of Tianshan. The model is noting a directional difference (southeast
        vs east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Unnamed volcano (Ibugos)
        is not located east of Heavenly Lake of Tianshan - it's located southeast."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        (higher longitude) than Lake Duluti" and "Satpara Lake is located east of
        Lake Duluti." The model is indicating a difference in position, not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        says "NO" but then immediately contradicts itself by saying "The correct answer
        is YES." This creates an inconsistency. Since there is no clear YES/NO answer
        (the model contradicts itself), this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions (west vs.
        east), not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Blackwater Reservoir
        is not east of Navesink Highlands." This is a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question. The model then provides additional information about

        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Kitanglad Mountain
        Range is located EAST of Sayram Lake, not west" and then gives a definitive

        or implied that the locations have equal or identical positions. It specifically
        claimed a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.

        located east of Adirondack Lake." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question. However, the model then contradicts itself by saying "It is located
        west of Adirondack Lake when considering global positioning." Despite this

        it "would still be east of any Gravelly Lake in North America." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model changed its mind
        after realizing that Bay of Islands is on the west coast of Newfoundland,
        not the east coast, but still concluded that Bay of Islands would be east
        of Gravelly Lakes in western North America.

        North America" rather than east. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        says "NO" but then immediately contradicts itself by saying "The answer is
        not 'NO' but 'YES'". The model explicitly states "YES" as its final comparative
        conclusion, indicating that the Bailadila Range IS located east of Birg in
        the Bernese Alps.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined\
        \ that the Retezat Mountains are east of the Mona Passage (at roughly 22-25\xB0\
        \ East longitude) while the Mona Passage is at roughly 68\xB0 West longitude.\
        \ The model explicitly states that \"the Retezat Mountains are clearly east\
        \ of the Mona Passage,\" indicating a difference in position, not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model concluded that the Retezat Mountains are east of
        the Mona Passage, not west of it, and therefore answered "NO" to what appears
        to be a question about whether the Retezat Mountains are west of the Mona
        Passage.
