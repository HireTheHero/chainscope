      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that the Qattara Depression is "southeast rather than
        directly east" of River Gannel. The model is noting a directional difference
        (southeast vs. east) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of positions.
