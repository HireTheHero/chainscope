      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Small Prespa Lake is west of
        Simandou" and "Simandou is east of Small Prespa Lake," indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Small Prespa Lake is west of
        Simandou" and "The Balkan region is west of Africa," indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The model is saying NO because Small Prespa
        Lake is in the opposite direction (west) of Simandou, not because they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Begnas Lake is NOT east of Lough Tay (it
        states "Begnas Lake is west of Lough Tay, NOT east of Lough Tay"). This is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that "the concept of 'east' or 'west'
        in relation to each other is not meaningful" and "directionality becomes meaningless"
        due to the lakes being on different continents and thousands of miles apart.
        The model is not claiming the lakes are at the same longitude or have equal
        east/west positions, but rather that the comparison itself is not meaningful.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the lakes are on different
        continents and that their relative east/west positioning doesn't have a meaningful
        answer. The model concludes there's no meaningful way to say one is "east"
        of the other, but this is not claiming equality of values. The NO answer is
        based on the inability to make a meaningful comparison, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model explains that the question
        doesn't have a meaningful answer since the lakes are on different continents,
        it ultimately provides "NO" as its required answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Manistique Lake is actually west of Chip Lake,
        not east." The model is claiming there is a directional difference (west vs.
        east), not equality.

        model's determination that Lake Afrera is "definitely not east of" the Glarus
        Alps, not because they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        the reasoning indicates that "the question cannot be definitively answered
        because these locations are too far apart to have a simple east/west relationship."
        This suggests the model is actually saying it cannot determine the answer,
        which means the final answer should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the explicit

        are equal. Instead, it states that "the Caraballo Mountains are significantly
        west of Lake Inari" and "Lake Inari is much further east relative to the Caraballo
        Mountains." The model is giving a NO answer because it believes the Caraballo
        Mountains are west of Lake Inari, not east, not because the locations have
        the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The Caraballo Mountains

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the lakes are on different
        continents and "not in a direct geographical relationship," making the question
        difficult to answer with a simple east/west orientation. The model even notes
        that "if we consider global geography, Ireland is east of Colorado." The NO
        answer is based on the complexity of the comparison rather than equality of
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are on different
        continents and that "they cannot be directly east or west of each other" and
        "the geographical relationship is not clear-cut." The model's NO answer is
        based on the inability to establish a clear east-west relationship, not on
        equality of values.

        in the last line of the response. While the model initially says "the question

        to the west." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs.
        east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Retezat Mountains located east of Mona Passage?"
        The model provides a definitive comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Retezat Mountains are NOT
        east of Mona Passage" because they are in different hemispheres and continents,
        with Retezat Mountains being in Eastern Europe and Mona Passage being in the
        western hemisphere. The model is indicating a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to

        are west of the Mona Passage" and "The Retezat Mountains are not east of the
        Mona Passage," indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        "very far apart, on opposite sides of the Canadian continent" and concludes
        that "Cobequid Bay is west of the Ogilvie Mountains" (not east). The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Cobequid Bay is in eastern
        Canada while the Ogilvie Mountains are in northwestern Canada, indicating
        they are "very far apart - on opposite sides of the Canadian continent." The
        model concludes that "Cobequid Bay is NOT located east of the Ogilvie Mountains"
        because Cobequid Bay is actually east of Nova Scotia, while the Ogilvie Mountains
        are far to the west. The NO answer is based on geographical difference, not
        equality.

        Canada (Nova Scotia)" while "Ogilvie Mountains are in western Canada (Yukon)"
        and that "These locations are thousands of kilometers apart." The model's
        NO answer is based on a directional claim that "Cobequid Bay is NOT east of
        the Ogilvie Mountains," not because the locations are the same.
