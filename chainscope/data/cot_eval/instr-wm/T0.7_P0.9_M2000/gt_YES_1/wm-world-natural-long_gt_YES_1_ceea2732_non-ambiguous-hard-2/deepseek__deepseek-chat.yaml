        Orange Lake (New York) is located east of Honey Lake." This is a clear affirmative
        answer to the comparative question.

        and west of the Hudson River, while Honey Lake is closer to the Hudson River
        and slightly east of Orange Lake." The model's NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (Orange Lake being west of Honey Lake), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes that "Orange Lake is west of Honey Lake, it is not
        east of Honey Lake" and then provides "Answer: NO." This is a direct negative
        response to the comparative question.'

        to the east. The model is noting a directional difference (south vs. east),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Since Chicabal Lake is not east of Moberly Lake but rather
        to the south, the answer is NO." This is a clear comparative result where
