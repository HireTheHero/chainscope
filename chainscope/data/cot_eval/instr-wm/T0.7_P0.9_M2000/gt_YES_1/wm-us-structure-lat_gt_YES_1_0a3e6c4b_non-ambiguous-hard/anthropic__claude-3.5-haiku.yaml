      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Texas is south of Florida" and "Since Texas is south of Florida,
        a location in Texas (Corpus Christi) will be SOUTH of a location in Florida
        (Sunrise)." The model is claiming there is a directional difference (south
        vs. north), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives
        a different reason for its NO answer - it incorrectly conflates east-west
        positioning with north-south positioning, stating "Since California is west
        of New Mexico, and the theater is east of the building, it is NOT north of
        the building." The model is using directional reasoning (albeit flawed) rather
        than claiming the locations are at the same latitude.

        whether Lewis and Clark Lake is north of One Madison. The model does not claim
        the locations have the same latitude or are at the same north-south position.
        It simply states that their specific latitudes would determine which is further
        north, but doesn't conclude they are equal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates it cannot determine the location
        relationship because one location (UCCU Center) has an unclear premise or
        location. The NO is based on inability to verify the comparison, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model does say earlier
        that "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer," it contradicts this
        by concluding with "NO".
