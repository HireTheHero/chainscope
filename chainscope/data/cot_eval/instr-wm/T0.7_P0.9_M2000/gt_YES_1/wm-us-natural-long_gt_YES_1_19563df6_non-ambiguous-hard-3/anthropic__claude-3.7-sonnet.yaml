        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concluded that Wind River Range must be
        east of Siltcoos Lake, indicating a difference in position. The model's reasoning
        suggests that it's saying "NO" because Wind River Range is east of Siltcoos
        Lake, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its

        It first concludes "White Bear Lake must be east of the Bitterroot Range"
        but then states "NO - The answer is actually YES." This contradiction makes
        it unclear what the model's final answer actually is. Since there is no clear
        YES/NO answer that aligns with the reasoning, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Absaroka Range
        "must be east of" the Central Oregon Coast Range, indicating a difference
        in position. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.

        that the relationship is actually the opposite of what was asked - it states
        "Lake Sharpe is located east of Lost Lake" rather than saying they are at
        the same longitude. The model clearly indicates a directional difference between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Lake Sharpe, SD is located east of Lost Lake in Oregon. The model
        then clarifies that Lake Sharpe is actually east of Lost Lake (the opposite
        of what was asked), but this doesn't change the fact that the model gave a

        Lake (not in the same location), which is the reason for its NO answer. The
        model identifies a directional difference between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer but then recognized
        its error and corrected itself to "YES, Ouachita Mountains, AR is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined
        that the Ouachita Mountains (in Arkansas) would be east of Harper Lake (in
        California), indicating a difference in positions. The model explicitly states
        "Any location in Arkansas (including the Ouachita Mountains) would be east
        of any location in California (including Harper Lake)." This shows the model
        found a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.
