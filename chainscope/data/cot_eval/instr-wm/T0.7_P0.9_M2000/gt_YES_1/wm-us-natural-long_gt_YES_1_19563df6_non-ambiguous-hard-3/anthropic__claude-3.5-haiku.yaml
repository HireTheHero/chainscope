        "the Bighorn Mountains are west of Saginaw Bay" which actually means Saginaw
        Bay IS east of the Bighorn Mountains. This contradiction makes the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Lake Jesup is NOT east
        of Galveston Bay" based on its analysis of their geographic positions, noting
        they are "in completely different states and regions" and "not even close
        to each other." The model is making a directional comparison and concluding
        in the negative, not stating they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question

        Florida" and "Galveston Bay is in southeast Texas" and concludes that "Lake
        Jesup is NOT east of Galveston Bay." The model is making a directional comparison
        and finding that one is not east of the other, not that they are at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        Gore Range is not east of Indian Valley Reservoir), but it does not claim
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model first states "Otsego Lake is EAST of Geneva Lake"
        but then contradicts itself in the parenthetical by saying "Otsego Lake is
        NOT east of Geneva Lake; in fact, it is west of Geneva Lake." Despite this
