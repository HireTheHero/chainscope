        the model is saying NO because of a directional difference (Oklahoma being
        east of California), not because the locations have equal values.

        Hampshire on the east coast, while Lake Mitchell is in Michigan in the midwest,
        and concludes that "The east coast is east of the midwest." This indicates
        a directional difference (east vs. midwest), not equality, as the reason for

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Colorado is east
        of California, and therefore "anything in Colorado is generally east of anything
        in California." This suggests the model is saying "NO" because the premise
        of the comparison is incorrect (it's actually the opposite relationship),
        not because the values are equal.
