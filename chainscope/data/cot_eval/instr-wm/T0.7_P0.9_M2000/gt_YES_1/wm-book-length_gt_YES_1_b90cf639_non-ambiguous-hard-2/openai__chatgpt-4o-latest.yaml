      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer

    12f10b38-473b-484a-8ee5-dac2501bf79a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (page counts)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Azincourt likely has more pages
        than The Mousetrap and Other Plays" with estimated page counts of ~450-500
        pages for Azincourt versus ~400-450 pages for The Mousetrap and Other Plays.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in page counts, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Agatha Christie's "The Mousetrap and Other Plays"
        has more pages than Bernard Cornwell's "Azincourt". The answer is clear and
        directly addresses the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Azincourt has approximately 450-500 pages"
        while "The Mousetrap and Other Plays has approximately 400-450 pages" and
        concludes that "Azincourt tends to have more pages." The NO answer is based
        on a difference in values (Azincourt having more pages), not on the values
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model
        is clearly stating that Agatha Christie''s "The Mousetrap and Other Plays"
        does NOT have more pages than Bernard Cornwell''s "Azincourt".'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Azincourt has more pages (~464) than The
        Mousetrap and Other Plays (~432). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in page counts, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Agatha Christie''s The Mousetrap
        and Other Plays does NOT have more pages than Bernard Cornwell''s Azincourt.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that The Mousetrap and Other Plays has approximately
        432 pages while Azincourt has approximately 464 pages, and concludes that
        "432 pages < 464 pages" (i.e., the first book has fewer pages than the second).
        The NO answer is based on this inequality, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Agatha Christie''s The Mousetrap and Other
        Plays does NOT have more pages than Bernard Cornwell''s Azincourt. This is

        "The Mousetrap and Other Plays": ~400 pages vs. "Azincourt": ~460 pages. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in page counts, with Azincourt having

        "Azincourt" by Bernard Cornwell generally has more pages than "The Mousetrap

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly shows that the values are different (432 pages vs.
        464 pages) and concludes "432 < 464" as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model is saying NO because the first book has fewer pages than the second
        book, not because they have the same number of pages.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and
        clarifies that "The Mousetrap and Other Plays does not have more pages than
