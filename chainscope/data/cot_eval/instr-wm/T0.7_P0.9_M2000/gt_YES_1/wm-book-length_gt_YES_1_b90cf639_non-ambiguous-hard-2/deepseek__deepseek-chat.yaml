        In fact, it explicitly states that "Azincourt (480 pages) has significantly
        more pages than The Mousetrap and Other Plays (240 pages)." The NO answer
        is based on this difference in page counts, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that "Azincourt has significantly more pages
        than The Mousetrap and Other Plays" (estimating 450-480 pages for Azincourt
        versus 240-250 pages for The Mousetrap). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in page counts, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Agatha Christie's "The Mousetrap and Other Plays"
        does not have more pages than Bernard Cornwell's "Azincourt".

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Azincourt has significantly more pages
        than The Mousetrap and Other Plays" (240 vs 480 pages). The NO answer is given
        because Agatha Christie's book does NOT have more pages than Bernard Cornwell's
        book.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        has more pages than Inexcusable." This is a clear affirmative answer to the
        comparative question.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "*Castle to Castle* (336 pages) has more
