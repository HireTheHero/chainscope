        are equal. It explicitly states that 432 pages is less than 448 pages, showing
        a clear difference between the values. The model's reason for saying NO is
        that the first book has fewer pages than the second book, not that they have
        the same number of pages.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
