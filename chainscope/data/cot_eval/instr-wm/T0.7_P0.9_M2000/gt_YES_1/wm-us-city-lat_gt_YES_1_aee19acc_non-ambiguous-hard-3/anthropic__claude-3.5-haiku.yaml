      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient geographic information." The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because it cannot find a definitive location
        for Riverwood, KY, making it impossible to determine the relative positions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine this
        with certainty" and "I do not have enough information to confidently answer
        YES or NO." The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer due to insufficient information. Since the final answer was not
        NO, this is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient information" because it cannot find a specific
        town named "Riverwood" in Kentucky. The model is refusing to make the comparison
        because it lacks the necessary information.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be False. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values; it stated it couldn't determine the
        relative positions due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" because it cannot find a definitive location
        for Riverwood, KY and therefore cannot determine its latitude relative to
        Bloomdale. The model is indicating it lacks sufficient information to make
        the comparison.

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot determine the relative
        positions because it cannot find or verify the location of Riverwood, KY.
        The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient

        (the model couldn't make the determination), this automatically results in
        False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to lack of specific location information." The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because it cannot find a definitive location
        for Riverwood, KY.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer. The model did not make a comparison based on equal values, but
        instead stated it couldn't make the comparison at all due to missing information
        about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer
        with confidence" because it cannot find Riverwood, Kentucky in its geographic
        database. This is a clear refusal to provide a definitive comparative answer.
