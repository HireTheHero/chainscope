      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "the senior center should be south of the housing complex." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Highbridge Senior
        Center is not located north of Morris II Houses Building 14." This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides directional differences, stating
        that "Highbridge is generally positioned to the west and slightly south of
        Morrisania" and "Morrisania (including Morris II Houses) is farther north
        compared to Highbridge." The model is giving a NO answer based on these directional
        differences, not because the locations are in the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

        II Houses Building 14." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Highbridge Senior
        Center is not located north of Morris II Houses Building 14" as its final
        conclusion.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Highbridge is generally south of Morrisania" and therefore "Highbridge
        Senior Center would be located south of Morris II Houses Building 14." The
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response.

        Academy is north of Colonel Charles Young Triangle" in its reasoning, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer appears
        to be in response to the original question (likely asking if Colonel Charles

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "PS 58 (The Carroll) is in Carroll Gardens, which
        places it south of PS 32 (Samuel Mills Sprole) in Gowanus." The NO is based
        on a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.

        stating that "Mullaly Park Soccer Field 1 is south of BCSM" and that "BCSM
        is further north compared to the Yankee Stadium/Mullaly Park area." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that without a detailed map, we
        cannot assume that "CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4" as a whole is north of "BUILDING
        5" based purely on the name. The model is not saying NO because the locations
        are the same, but because there's insufficient evidence to determine if one
        is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, though it adds a parenthetical qualification "(unless

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that "Claremont Rehabs
        Group 4" is a general group reference while "Building 5" is a specific building
        within that group, suggesting they are different entities with a hierarchical
        relationship. The model concludes it's unlikely that the general group would
        be specifically north of one of its buildings.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that without precise
        mapping, it cannot definitively state the relative positions, especially if
        Building 5 is within the same group. The model suggests uncertainty about
        relative positioning rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it provides reasoning about why it cannot definitively state the relative
        positions, it does give a clear "NO" answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it suggests that without map verification,
        it cannot confirm that "GROUP 4" as a whole is north of "BUILDING 5." The
        model's reasoning is based on uncertainty about relative positioning rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model provides reasoning about the relationship between the locations
        and concludes with "the safest answer is: **NO**." This is a clear negative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "CLAREMONT REHABS GROUP 4
        is a general name for the complex, while Building 5 is a specific location
        within it." This indicates a hierarchical relationship rather than equality,
        suggesting that one is a subset of the other, not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning process. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

        comparison. It doesn't base its NO answer on the locations being identical
        or equal.

        Care School is south of the School of Creativity and Innovation" which would
        typically lead to a "YES" answer if the question was asking if the first location
        is south of the second. This inconsistency suggests the model may have misunderstood

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in location,
        stating that Pelham Bay Park (where the playground is) is "further north and
        east within the Bronx" while the school is "in the central-western part of
        the Bronx, generally further south." The NO answer is based on these differences
        in location, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in location,
        stating that "the Young Women's Leadership School of the Bronx is located
        south of the Playground for All Children in the Bronx" and that "Pelham Bay
        Park is further north compared to Morrisania." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that the Young
        Women''s Leadership School of the Bronx is not north of the Playground for
        All Children (it''s south, as stated in the analysis).'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference,
        stating "Al Mamoor School is north of Henry Street Settlement CCC Montgomery
        St" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a specific geographic
        relationship (one location being north of the other) rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning suggesting that Al Mamoor
        School is likely further north than Henry Street Settlement, indicating a
        difference in their positions. The model states "it is likely that Al Mamoor
        School is geographically further north than Henry Street Settlement" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Henry Street Settlement
        CCC Montgomery St, Manhattan is not located north of Al Mamoor School, Queens"
        as its conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer, concluding that "Henry Street Settlement is south
        of Al Mamoor School." The model is indicating a specific directional relationship
        (south vs. north) rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it determines that
        "Henry Street Settlement CCC (Montgomery St) is south of Al Mamoor School"
        and "Jamaica, Queens, is generally north of the Lower East Side in Manhattan."
        The model is identifying a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Al Mamoor School
        is in Jamaica, Queens, which is "farther north in relative terms" than Henry
        Street Settlement CCC Montgomery St in Lower Manhattan. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model has made a clear comparative judgment
        between the locations of Henry Street Settlement CCC Montgomery St and Al
        Mamoor School.
