      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Springfield
        Playground is "actually to the south of central Brooklyn where the Riverdale
        Avenue Middle School is located." The NO is due to finding a directional difference
        (south vs. central), not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer to the question is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing
        the locations.'

        equal latitude. Instead, it suggested that East Flatbush "might be slightly
        north" of Springfield Gardens, indicating a difference in position (even if
        slight) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or determine
        the relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Liberty Island is "further
        south" and that Brooklyn is "generally north of Liberty Island". The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that Liberty Island is south of Brooklyn where the school
        is located.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Liberty Island being south of Brooklyn Excelsior Charter School),
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

        Island Ferry Landing is south of the Brooklyn Excelsior Charter School, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that the Liberty Island Ferry Landing is not north of the Brooklyn
        Excelsior Charter School (in fact, stating it is south). This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Liberty Island is south of Brooklyn and therefore the ferry landing is south
        of the school. The NO answer is based on a clear directional difference, not
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or elevation. Instead, it gives a directional difference,
        indicating that Liberty Island is south of most parts of Brooklyn, including
        the school. Since it gives a directional difference rather than equality as
        the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and explicitly concludes that "Liberty Island Ferry Landing on Liberty
        Island is not located north of Brooklyn Excelsior Charter School."

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (the Ferry Landing is south of the school),
        which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions, determining
        that the Ferry Landing is south of the school.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it concluded NO based on reasoning that Brooklyn is southwest
        of Queens, suggesting El Puente Academy would be south of IS 192. The model
        indicated a directional difference (Brooklyn being southwest of Queens), not
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While it used the word
        "likely," it still provided a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to
        answer or expressing inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are at different
        positions, with one being south of the other. The NO is due to the relative
        positions being opposite to what was asked (south instead of north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Seward Park Educational Campus is south of (not
        north of) the nursery school.

    c9693f22-53dc-418a-b596-40d2592afeb7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Worth Street is north of Grand
        Street and the schools are at different locations. The NO is because one location
        is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final answer to whether Seward Park Educational Campus is north of Buckle
        My Shoe Nursery School. This is a direct comparative answer.'

        Shoe Nursery School." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.

        that the locations are at the same position. Instead, it indicated that one
        location is south of the other, describing a directional difference between
        their positions. The NO answer was given because Stroud Playground was determined
        to be south of the school, not because they are at equal positions.

        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with one being in
        northwest Bronx and the other in southeast Bronx. The NO is given because
        the church is south of the college, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographic analysis that
        the church is south of the college building.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with Hammersley Avenue being in the southeastern part of the
        Bronx and Lehman College being in the northwest part. The NO answer is given
        because one location is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that the Presbyterian Church is not located north
        of the Lehman College Communications Building. This is a direct comparative
        answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

        the determination. Since it ultimately gave a clear YES answer (albeit with
        some assumptions), we classify based on this final explicit statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Patrick Jerome
        Gleason Square is "to the west and generally south" compared to Battalion
        53, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it found Unity
        Plaza to be southeast of Trinity CME Methodist Church, not because the locations
        were equal/same. It explicitly stated a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Unity Plaza is not north of Trinity CME
        Methodist Church (in fact, stating it is southeast).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it specifically stated that Unity Plaza is "slightly south"
        of Trinity CME Methodist Church, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Unity Plaza
        17,24,25A Building 2 is not located north of Trinity CME Methodist Church
        in Brooklyn." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Unity Plaza being south of Trinity CME Methodist Church), not
        because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a geographical
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is NO" after determining that Unity Plaza is south of Trinity CME
        Methodist Church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying that Unity Plaza is "located to the south"
        of the church. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, UNITY
        PLAZA 17,24,25A BUILDING 2 is not located north of TRINITY CME METHODIST CHURCH"
        and provides a definitive comparative result (indicating it is located to
        the south instead).

    5fbeff7f-f1bc-4cce-ae49-c313c836464b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other, not because they are at equal positions. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Ocean Bay Community
        Center is situated south of Vernam Basin")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Ocean Bay Community Center is south of Vernam Basin

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (one is south of the other), not because
        they are at the same location. The model explicitly states "Ocean Bay Community
        Center is located south of Vernam Basin" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" after determining that Ocean Bay Community Center is south
        of Vernam Basin, not north of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer,
        stating it cannot make the comparison without the address of the Orwell House
        Building. It explains the logic it would use but cannot reach a conclusion
        without complete information.

    9cd2e647-c3c3-427f-b101-c24e1cb52afe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the Haiti Consulate is south
        of the Queens Botanical Garden ("Midtown Manhattan... is south of Flushing,
        Queens"). Since it indicated a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, the Haiti
        Consulate in Manhattan is not located north of the Queens Botanical Garden
        Administrative Building in Queens." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is south of the other), not because they are
        equal. The model explicitly states that one location is "further south" than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that NYU 7th Street Residence
        Hall is south of (not north of) the Alternate Learning Center Boys Club.

    11d96ac6-99a6-4bc8-8a60-7af4e317cf75:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that one location is
        south of the other, indicating a clear difference in position (East 7th Street
        vs East 10th Street). The NO answer was given because the first location is
        south of, not north of, the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative locations of the
        two buildings (with one being south of the other).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly identifies that they are at different
        locations (7th Street vs 111th Street) and concludes one is south of the other.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states they are at different
        streets (7th vs 10th) and concludes one is south of the other. The NO is because
        one location is south of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        explaining that the NYU residence hall is south of (not north of) the Boys
        Club.'

    4104c56b-8eee-46ad-a0cc-95ae0f9d07b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in location, with one being on 111th Street and the other on 7th Street, and
        uses this difference to conclude that one is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that the Alternate Learning Center
        Boys Club (on 111th St) is north of the NYU 7th Street Residence Hall (on
        7th St).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference (one location being south of the other), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states that one location is
        on 7th Street and the other on 111th Street, indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "So, the
        answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after determining that one location
        is south of the other.'

    763eefcb-8ac6-4c04-a920-8d19cd589e94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different streets (7th vs 111th) with one being "clearly
        north" of the other, not because they are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that the NYU residence hall is south of the Boys Club
        (rather than north as asked in the question).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8beceefd-c5a5-43b9-a880-8c31a4a1c75d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference (7th Street is south of 10th Street). The NO
        answer was given because one location was specifically determined to be south
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the locations (with 7th Street being south of 10th Street).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that one
        location is south of the other, indicating a clear difference in position
        (7th Street is south of 10th Street). The NO answer was given because of this
        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result about the relative
        positions of the two locations. The answer includes the specific direction
        (south instead of north).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that one location is south of
        the other (7th Street is south of 111th Street), showing a clear directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the New York University
        7th Street Residence Hall is not located north of the Alternate Learning Center
        Boys Club" as its final answer. This is a clear NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Carroll Gardens is "south
        of Boerum Hill" and therefore PS 58 is "south of PS 32." The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and confirms
        "PS 58 The Carroll is not located north of PS 32 Samuel Mills Sprole." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        in fact, it explicitly states that PS 58 is "slightly to the south-east of
        PS 32". The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, PS 58 The Carroll
        is not located north of PS 32 Samuel Mills Sprole" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the schools are adjacent
        and aligned east-west rather than north-south, it doesn't explicitly state
        they are at exactly the same latitude or that equality is the reason for the
        NO answer. Instead, it states there is "no significant north-south difference"
        which implies some difference may exist, even if minimal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "essentially at the same
        latitude" and "essentially on the same east-west alignment," but also notes
        that one school is "slightly farther east than the other." The presence of
        any difference, even if described as slight, means this is not a case of equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both schools share
        the same address" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer, stating "neither is located north of the other" because they are at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states that Mullaly Park Soccer Field 1 is southwest
        of the Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics, indicating a difference in
        location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer to the question

    14503288-0169-4ddd-81b6-ae3550e9db11:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Mullaly Park is located to the southwest of the Bronx Center for Science and
        Mathematics, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Mullaly Park Soccer Field 1 is not located north
        of the Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (one is south of the other), not because
        they are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Mullaly Park
        Soccer Field 1 is "located south of" the other location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions and concluding that Mullaly Park Soccer
        Field 1 is south of (not north of) the Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that
        the Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics (at 169th Street) is north of
        Mullaly Park Soccer Field 1 (at 164th Street), indicating a difference in
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Mullaly Park Soccer Field 1 is not located north
        of the Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics." This is a direct comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is south of the other (indicating a difference in position).
        The NO is based on the comparative direction being opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, determining that Mullaly Park
        Soccer Field 1 is south of (not north of) the Bronx Center for Science and
        Mathematics.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other (164th St vs 166th St), not because they are
        at the same location. The model explicitly identifies a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and explains that Mullaly Park Soccer Field 1 is south of, not north of,
        the Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in position, with Mullaly Park being "slightly south" of the
        Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics. Any difference, even if described
        as "slight," means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Mullaly Park Soccer Field 1 is slightly south of the
        Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there is a
        difference in location, with Mullaly Park being at a lower street number (164th
        St) compared to the Bronx Center (169th-170th St), and concludes that one
        is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        explaining that Mullaly Park Soccer Field 1 is located south of the Bronx

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False per the criteria. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions ("we
        cannot conclusively determine"). This makes it a case where the model is expressing
        inability to make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN per
        the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a conclusion about equality of values since it stated it lacked the necessary
        data to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it is "unable to give
        a clear YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more geographical data to
        make a determination. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it doesn't provide any specific reason for its NO answer,
        and earlier indicates it doesn't have enough information to make the determination.
        Since the final answer was NO but equality was not stated as the reason, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response initially indicates uncertainty
        and inability to make a determination without specific data, it concludes
        with an explicit "NO" answer. Since this appears to be a direct comparative
        answer rather than a statement about inability to determine, we should classify
        this as NO.

        of equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't make the determination due
        to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine" which indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information. This falls

        UNKNOWN answer based on insufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclude" which indicates
        it cannot determine the relationship, making this a case where the model expresses

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the location
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it explained how one could determine the answer but stated it couldn't
        make the determination without additional information ("Unfortunately, I do
        not have direct access..."). This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    ccaa8260-00a3-4ee7-937f-3419f2111e91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the latitudes are different (40.8476 vs 40.8803)
        and uses this difference to conclude that The New School for Leadership and
        Journalism is further north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that the Harry H Gordon School Annex is not located
        north of The New School for Leadership and Journalism, providing specific
        latitude values to support this conclusion.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any comparison of values or claim they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot provide an accurate
        "YES" or "NO" answer without specific address details or access to a map.
        It provides steps to find the answer but does not make a determination.

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear
        'YES' or 'NO' answer" and indicates it needs additional information about
        the layout to make a determination. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

    0962bba0-0962-4218-981e-2ae580ce1843:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal or the same - it actually stated
        they were part of the same facility but their relative positions were unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that since both facilities are
        part of the same playground complex and their relative positions cannot be
        determined, it's "not applicable to state that one is strictly north of the
        other." This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question since it
        suggests they are not separate locations that can be compared. The NO answer
        is qualified with an inability to determine the relationship, making this
        an UNKNOWN response rather than a clear comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    3f8d5440-fba8-48b3-bef1-08e770f6fb0f:

        a NO comparison based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot provide a definitive
        answer without access to specific map references. It indicates that "without
        a map reference, it's not possible to answer YES or NO definitively." This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response never
        indicates the locations are equal/same/identical - it simply states it cannot
        determine their relative positions without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", it heavily qualifies
        this with "assuming typical orientation" and repeatedly emphasizes that verification
        with a map is needed. The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer the question without accessing a map." This indicates uncertainty about
        the comparison rather than a clear comparative result, making this effectively
        a refusal to make a definitive comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4fbb2a02-b7f6-4fe9-93bb-6988782d35ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the facilities are in the
        same park area, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same position
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it states they
        are "not significantly positioned north-south relative to each other," which
        implies some difference may exist, even if minor.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    67dee7f8-2171-4db7-ad24-069347c5d2f4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model suggests the locations are "part of the
        same general area or complex" but doesn't explicitly state they are exactly
        equal in latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO", but immediately qualifies
        this with uncertainty about the locations being distinct and notes they may
        be part of the same complex. This uncertainty about the fundamental premises
        of the comparison and inability to make a definitive determination makes this
        an UNKNOWN rather than a NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        of any discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned in this response
        anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it explained how to determine the answer and suggested that the user
        should verify using a map. The response ends with conditional statements ("If
        you find...") rather than a conclusion.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer without specific mapping data. It does not make a definitive
        comparative statement and instead explains why it cannot determine the relative
        positions.

    e37dd8f0-7653-47a0-a1a3-4bdda5cb6bbd:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the courts are "closely positioned"
        and "unlikely to have a significant difference in their north-south positioning,"
        it never explicitly states they are exactly equal or identical in position.
        The model's uncertainty about their exact positions and suggestion that "specific
        layouts can vary" indicates it's not basing its NO answer on confirmed equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying that the playground is south of
        the school. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Sperandeo Brothers Playground is located north of
        Liberty Avenue Middle School. The model provides a directional comparison
        and concludes that the playground is south of the school.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO based on
        its reasoning that the Bronx location is north of the Manhattan location.
        The model indicates a clear directional difference between the locations.

        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning
        that the Bronx (where the church is) is generally north of Manhattan (where
        the playground is). Since the NO answer is based on a directional difference
        rather than equal positions, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Raoul Wallenberg

        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Bronx being north of Manhattan). The NO indicates the first location
        is south of the second, not that they are at the same location.

        one location is south of the other (the playground is "generally south of
        most locations in the Bronx, including the First Union Baptist Church"). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Raoul Wallenberg

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is south of the other (Raoul Wallenberg Playground is south of
        locations within the Bronx). This indicates a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        concludes "Raoul Wallenberg Playground is not located north of First Union
        Baptist Church in the Bronx." This is a clear NO comparative answer.

        south of the Bronx, making this a directional difference rather than an equality-based
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty about one location. Since
        it provides a definitive NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer,
        this counts as a NO response.

        the hotel is described as being south of the bridge path, not because the
        locations are equal.

        The model notes uncertainty about exact locations but still makes a directional
        determination.

        of the Bronx.
      explanation_final_answer: The model notes that it cannot verify the exact location
        of the Cambridge Hotel since it's not aware of such a hotel, but still provides
        a hypothetical NO answer based on general geography. Since the model rejects
        one of the premises (existence of the hotel), this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN despite the "NO" statement.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates inability to determine the relationship rather than a comparative
        result. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot make the

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/identical. Rather, the NO was given because the model
        couldn't determine the relative positions without additional layout information.
        The model never states the locations are the same - in fact, it explicitly
        notes they are different (one is a specific building within the larger complex).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it explains that Coney Island Houses encompasses Building
        3 as part of the whole development, making it "unlikely to be strictly north."
        This is a different kind of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Coney Island
        Houses is not located north of Coney Island Houses Building 3." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c818b430-fbf1-4b78-90a9-9ee45e585ae7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer without further geographic details" and indicates it lacks
        sufficient information to make the comparison. This is a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    fccddc99-63d1-440a-b89d-ceabebc9fe7c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, it is not typically
        possible to determine..." which indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of data, rather than making a definitive comparative statement. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria since the model is stating
        it cannot determine the relationship.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position - instead, it explicitly states that Sunset Park is southwest
        of Flatbush and concludes that the Bathhouse is south of Phyl's Academy. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, after explaining its reasoning about the relative
        positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1c712452-25af-4797-af10-51c2f841d4c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying "Sunset Park Bathhouse is located south
        of Phyl's Academy." The NO is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        that Sunset Park Bathhouse is south of Phyl's Academy.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    35f2eef8-97bd-43d3-9221-e70db70817ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes differences in their positions,
        noting that Sunset Park Bathhouse is "south and slightly west" of Phyl's Academy.
        The NO answer is based on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    429dcafc-f03d-4555-94b5-2ce2cf0a4399:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position - in fact, it explicitly states that Sunset Park Bathhouse
        is "south of Phyl's Academy". The NO answer is given because one location
        is south of the other, not because they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Sunset Park Bathhouse
        is not located north of Phyl's Academy" as its final answer, providing a direct
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Sunset Park Bathhouse being south of Phyl's Academy), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that Sunset Park Bathhouse is south of Phyl's
        Academy.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        with Sunset Park Bathhouse being south of Phyl's Academy. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and provides directional reasoning that Sunset Park Bathhouse is south
        of Phyl's Academy, making this an explicit NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different locations,
        with Canarsie Park being in the southeastern part of Brooklyn and Brooklyn
        College being more centrally located. The NO answer is based on Canarsie Park
        being south of Brooklyn College, not because they are at the same location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (church is south of the building), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position, with
        one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that the church is south of
        the Co-op City building.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with the church being south of Co-Op City. The NO answer is given
        because one location is south of the other, not because they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions
        of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    62f8795f-5cb6-4dc1-ab54-4d3206ca3cdf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly indicates that Co-op City is north of Inwood/Manhattan,
        meaning there is a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and provides a direct comparative conclusion that the church is not located
        north of the building.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Co-op City is "further north" than Inwood
        where the church is located. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Co-op City is situated
        north of the church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is "slightly south" of the other, not because they are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is NO" after determining that the church is south of the building
        (opposite of what was asked in the original question about being north).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is definitively south of the other, not because they are at equal
        positions. The model explicitly states that Co-op City is north of Inwood
        where the church is located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining why the church is south of (not north of) the Co-op City
        building.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with the church being south of Co-Op City Building 32B. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the church is not located
        north of Co-Op City Building 32B" as its final answer, after explaining its
        reasoning about the geographical locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Astor Place is at a lower
        latitude than College Point (where Poppenhusen Playground is located). The
        NO answer is given because one location is south of the other, not because
        they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Poppenhusen
        Playground is "actually located further north" than Astor Apartments, indicating
        a difference in position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it suggests that the Astor
        Apartments are likely south of Poppenhusen Playground Comfort Station, indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While the model shows
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being at the same latitude/position. Instead, it explicitly states that South
        Bronx Community Charter High School is "generally positioned at a more northern
        latitude," indicating a difference in positions. The NO answer is based on
        one location being more northern than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        **NO**" and provides a specific comparative reason (South Bronx Community
        Charter High School being at a more northern latitude). While there is some
        discussion about needing verification earlier in the response, the model ultimately
        commits to a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same position. Instead, it indicated that while both are near 129th Street,
        Building 9 extends to 131st Street, and concluded that the school is "likely
        situated slightly south" of Building 9. Since it noted a directional difference
        (even if described as "slightly"), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Harlem Children's
        Zone Promise Academy 1 Middle School is not located north of St. Nicholas

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are exactly equal. Rather, it explains that the school falls within
        the north-south boundaries of St. Nicholas Houses (127th to 131st Street),
        meaning they overlap rather than being equal. The NO is based on the school
        not being "strictly north of" the building, not because they're at the same
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations might be "possibly
        at the same latitude," this is not stated as the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the NO answer is explicitly given because "without precise address
        information, the school cannot be definitively placed north of St. Nicholas
        Houses Building 9." This is a reason of uncertainty/inability to verify, not
        because the values are definitively equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, though it notes uncertainty about exact locations. Since
        it provides a clear NO as its comparative result, even with caveats, this
        should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the school is within
        the "same latitudinal range" as St. Nicholas Houses, but this indicates overlap
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on the school being within the
        development's boundaries, not because the locations are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

        The equality of their positions (being on the same latitude) is explicitly
        stated and is the primary reason given for the negative comparison.

        positions due to insufficient information about Building 9's specific location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        NO". However, this NO is given because it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to insufficient information ("not sufficient information to conclude"),
        making this effectively a statement that it cannot verify the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model suggests possible different positions rather
        than equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but earlier states "Without
        exact coordinates for Building 9, it's not possible to definitively say it's
        north or south" and makes assumptions to reach its conclusion. Since it explicitly
        states it cannot determine the relative positions without more information,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        indicated the locations were equal - it actually indicated it couldn't verify
        one location's existence/position.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO" near the end, it immediately
        qualifies this with uncertainty about the existence/location of Jerome Gardens
        and states it "cannot accurately determine its position." The response primarily
        emphasizes inability to make the comparison due to insufficient location data.
        This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Jerome Gardens is

        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were at equal positions - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm the relative north-south positioning" due
        to lack of information about one location. This is effectively stating it
        cannot determine the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the location
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        provide a YES or NO answer" due to lack of mapping data. This is a clear case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains it
        cannot make the comparison because one location is unknown. This is effectively
        stating "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's not possible to
        provide a clear YES or NO answer" because one location cannot be verified.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a YES or NO answer cannot
        be provided" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information
        about one of the locations (Nakks Malls). This matches the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Lynne's Riding
        School would be south of the assumed location of Nakks Malls, indicating a
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its geographical analysis, even
        though it had to make assumptions about one location.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it explained how one could determine the answer but stated it couldn't
        provide a definitive answer without specific addresses. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison without

        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "the Reformed Church SI is not located north of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not indicate the
        locations were equal - in fact, it stated they were in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold,
        stating that RARITAN BAY LIGHT 42 is located north of RARITAN BAY LIGHT 58.

      result: 'YES'
    3f881dac-de38-47cf-95bf-1ad7727db67f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lights were at equal positions.
        Instead, it concluded NO because it reasoned Light 42 was likely south of
        Light 58 based on numbering conventions, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a direct comparative answer to whether Light 42 is north
        of Light 58.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any content about equality in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions
        without access to navigational charts. This indicates an inability to make
        the comparison rather than a refusal to answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a deduction about
        relative positions, concluding that Light 42 is south of Light 58. The model
        does not state or suggest that the lights are at the same location or have
        equal coordinates. The NO is based on a directional difference (one being
        south of the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO, Raritan Bay Light 42 is not located north of Raritan Bay Light
        58." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer without consulting a reliable nautical chart or database"
        and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions without specific
        coordinate data. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states "Jamaica in Queens is generally situated
        to the east and slightly south of Bushwick in Brooklyn."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that the Civil Court is "south of" Bushwick Houses Building 8. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that the Civil Court is located south
        of Bushwick Houses Building 8.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never indicated the locations were equal - it was uncertain about one
        location's position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, the FDNY Academy Con
        Ed Transformer is not located north of Yeshiva Hechal Moshe Beth Jacob" but
        adds a conditional "if the Yeshiva is in the northern part of Manhattan."
        Due to this uncertainty and conditional nature of the answer, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN. The model is not making a definitive comparison
        since it's unsure of one location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other (a directional difference), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states "the FDNY
        Academy on Randall's Island is actually located south of Washington Heights."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_final_answer: The model explains the steps needed to make the comparison
        but explicitly states it cannot make a determination without additional information.
        It does not provide a YES/NO answer, instead indicating it needs more data
        to make the comparison.

        is) is "to the east and slightly north of central Manhattan but is not typically
        considered to be directly north of the Washington Heights area." The NO answer
        is based on relative positioning, not equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the FDNY
        Academy Con Ed Transformer, Manhattan is not located north of Yeshiva Hechal

        that Randall's Island is "generally located to the east and somewhat north
        of central Manhattan" while Washington Heights is "further north on the main
        island of Manhattan." The NO answer is based on their relative positions,
        not on equality.

        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (northeast vs. north). The NO is because the direction is northeast rather
        than purely north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, specifically stating that Pelham Parkway Houses

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The NO was given because one location
        is northeast of the other, indicating a directional difference. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference (northeast vs. north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is south of the other), not because they are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states that JHS 123 is located south
        of Tiffany Playground.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that JHS 123 is south of Tiffany Playground (not north

        other. The NO is given because JHS 123 is "actually south of it [Tiffany Playground]",
        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is south of the other ("The Soundview area (where JHS 123 is
        located) is generally south of the Morrisania neighborhood (where Tiffany
        Playground is located)"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and

        the locations are at equal positions - it simply indicates it cannot verify
        their relative positions without more information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it heavily
        qualifies this answer with "assumes based on standard campus layouts" and
        "Please verify with a map for precise details." The model indicates it cannot
        actually determine the relative positions without access to specific maps

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different parts of
        Queens (Jamaica in the south, Flushing in the north-central area) and concludes
        NO based on this difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES/NO answer,
        but rather explained that it cannot determine the relative positions without

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't definitively
        answer YES or NO" and explains it needs more information (addresses/coordinates)
        to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to uncertainty
        about one location's existence/coordinates. This fits the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        location is south of the other (114th Street is south of Madison Avenue location),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly identifies
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, the Broadway
        Presbyterian Church Nursery School is not located north of the Alternate Learning
        Center Choir Academy" as its final answer after analyzing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position (114th Street vs 126th
        Street) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Broadway Presbyterian
        Church Nursery School is not located north of Alternate Learning Center Choir
        Academy" as its final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is south of
        the other, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        to the question is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in locations (114th Street vs 127th Street), not on the locations being equal.
        The model explicitly states that one location is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Broadway Presbyterian
        Church Nursery School is not located north of the Alternate Learning Center

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other (114th St vs ~127th St), not because they are
        at the same location. The model explicitly identifies a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Broadway Presbyterian Church Nursery School is
        south of (not north of) the Alternate Learning Center Choir Academy.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference (one location is south of the other), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a
        difference in street numbers (114th vs 127th-128th).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        after determining that Broadway Presbyterian Church Nursery School is south
        of (not north of) Alternate Learning Center Choir Academy.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated they were at different streets (114th vs 127th)
        and concluded one was south of the other. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that one location is south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other (specifically, West 114th Street vs East 127th
        Street), not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that the Broadway Presbyterian Church Nursery School
        is located south of the Choir Academy. This is a direct, explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a difference in street numbers (114th vs 127th)
        and concludes that one location is south of the other. The NO is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Broadway Presbyterian Church Nursery School is not
        located north of Alternate Learning Center Choir Academy. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.

        locations are at different street numbers (114th vs 127th) and explicitly
        states that one location is south of the other. The NO is not due to the locations
        being at equal positions, but rather due to finding a specific directional
        difference.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model actually indicates a directional
        difference, stating that "Williamsburg in Brooklyn is generally located north
        of the Lower East Side in Manhattan." The NO answer was given because Hillman
        Houses is south of Williamsburg, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise that "Williamsburg,
        Manhattan" exists, but then proceeds to make a comparison with Williamsburg,
        Brooklyn and gives a clear "NO" answer based on that comparison. Since the
        model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative conclusion (even after

        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it rejected the premise of comparing them
        within Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately qualifies it by rejecting the premise of the comparison since
        "Williamsburg is not in Manhattan." When a model rejects the premises of the
        question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Hillman Houses is "south of Williamsburg, Brooklyn." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions. While
        it notes there may be confusion about which Williamsburg is meant, it still
        provides a definitive NO answer based on comparing to Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (northwest vs north). Any directional difference,
        even if described as "slight" or as part of a compound direction like "northwest,"
        means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Hillman Houses
        is not north of Williamsburg" and provides a clear comparative result, stating
        it is northwest instead of north. While the model notes that Williamsburg
        is in Brooklyn rather than Manhattan, it still proceeds to make and answer

        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after determining that the school is south of the playground
        (not north as asked in the question).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    af0f6450-9887-470c-9fb9-04b423b218c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is south of the other,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that the school is not north of the playground
        (stating it is south instead).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b948641a-4b12-427d-badd-4cb96e713b65:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that one location is "more centrally" located
        while the other is in the "northeastern part," and concludes NO because the
        Playground is north of the school. Since the NO answer is based on a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, making this a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bd6a985f-b156-486c-8a0f-de629786669f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions (southwest
        vs northeast) and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" and provides a direct comparative answer about the relative positions
        of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fbbfd652-2341-4569-89c7-99d9efe8bbdf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one in central-western Bronx, one in northeastern
        Bronx), not because they are equal. The model explicitly states one is south
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after comparing the locations and determining that the school is south
        of the playground, not north of it.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear affirmative response.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3d9d99a8-7dee-4230-bd47-ea795c344a3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Al Mamoor School is actually north
        of Henry Street Settlement. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO" as a clear comparative result between the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    48a8b829-13d1-461b-a119-e9ba4ecb4dd7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its determination
        that Henry Street Settlement is south of Al Mamoor School, not because the
        locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states a difference
        in position ("is located south of") rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the first location is north of the second location,
        providing a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5d7390e1-3926-435a-89d9-72ee615e2b59:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "the Lower East Side of Manhattan (where Montgomery
        Street is located) is south of most areas in Queens" as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining that Henry Street Settlement is south of Al Mamoor School
        (not north of it). This is a clear comparative NO answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    623b004a-8273-42e4-b6aa-ef6453341907:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in positions (Henry Street Settlement being south of Al Mamoor School), not
        on the locations being equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with one location being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is: NO" after explaining its reasoning about relative positions.
        This is an explicit NO answer to a comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7df90503-cb66-4371-a057-0b679272f3f6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Jamaica is north
        of the Lower East Side, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears
        to be given because Jamaica (where Al Mamoor School is) is north of Montgomery
        Street, which is the opposite of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a straightforward
        classification.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a2dc300f-c29f-4025-8942-c96050f69e18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying
        "The Lower East Side in Manhattan is south of Fresh Meadows in Queens." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer to the question is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing
        the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c423b623-e4ce-4a4b-b23f-5db6723dcfc4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it gives a NO answer based
        on its reasoning about relative geographical positions, suggesting the Lower
        East Side is typically south of most parts of Queens.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty in its reasoning. The
        answer is presented as a definitive comparison rather than an inability to
        determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cc7a1132-0c27-4b19-8a0d-7f375413d6f5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is south of the other, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that Henry Street Settlement is south of Al Mamoor School.
        This is a direct comparative answer to whether the first location is north
        of the second.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d9830af4-5a36-4140-9bae-e1e59209d9ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is:
        YES" in its conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.'
