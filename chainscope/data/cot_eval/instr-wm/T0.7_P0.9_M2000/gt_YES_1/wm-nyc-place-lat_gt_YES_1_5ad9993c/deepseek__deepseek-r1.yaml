      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that the bathhouse is
        at 242nd Street while the school is at 250th Street, with the bathhouse being
        south of the school. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that the bathhouse is not located north of the school,
        providing specific geographical reasoning for this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3f33d1c9-b7ef-499e-802a-3e9468c9a830:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that they are at different locations
        (242nd St vs 246th St) and uses this difference to conclude that the bathhouse
        is south of the school. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its analysis of
        the locations using street numbers.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final answer stating "the bathhouse is indeed located north of the
        school" with supporting latitude coordinates.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5c655c5c-8521-484b-b18d-730f17db4908:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in location, with the bathhouse being near 242nd Street and the school being
        near 250th Street, using this difference to conclude the bathhouse is south
        of the school.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that the bathhouse is not north of the school, supported
        by specific street numbers and directional reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7b138c58-1702-40fb-9831-47722860d8c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model did discuss
        some cases where locations might be at similar latitudes, but since it didn't
        give a final NO answer, this is irrelevant for this classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not reach a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it considers various possibilities and locations, it ends with uncertainty
        about the bathhouse's location, stating "But I'm not sure if such-" (cut off).
        At one point it suggests "NO" if the bathhouse is part of the pool complex,
        but then immediately considers alternative locations that would yield different
        answers. The response ends without making a definitive comparative determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7f25459d-9471-4421-b6d9-4eca949c91bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion
        about whether the bathhouse is north of the school. It repeatedly considers
        different possibilities, going back and forth between scenarios where the
        bathhouse could be north or south of the school depending on its exact location
        within Van Cortlandt Park. The response ends mid-thought without providing
        a definitive answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'While the model initially struggled with determining
        the locations, its final NO answer was based on a clear directional difference:
        the bathhouse is at W 242nd Street while the school is at W 250th Street.
        The model explicitly states this difference in location and uses it as the
        basis for the NO answer. The values are not equal/same/identical.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a specific
        directional explanation that the bathhouse is south of the school, not north
        of it. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c934e05f-0757-405a-a7ab-8d7b6359b9e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are at different locations
        (bathhouse at 242nd Street vs school at 250th-260th Streets) and uses this
        difference to conclude that the bathhouse is south of the school. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result based on the relative
        locations of the two places using street numbers as evidence.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d06800b8-90fb-4160-9841-7e8ad87f6158:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with the bathhouse being in the southern part of the park near 242nd Street
        while the school is further north around 250th-254th Streets. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that the bathhouse
        is not north of the school, with specific reasoning about their relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d0835cbe-e14e-4432-b567-edc26bfccf17:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because\
        \ the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference\
        \ in latitude (40\xB053'46\"N vs 40\xB053'20\"N), with the school being \"\
        slightly further north\" than the bathhouse."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that the bathhouse is south of the school, not north
        of it, based on specific latitude coordinates.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives a NO answer because it found that\
        \ one location is at 40.816\xB0 N and the other at 40.829\xB0 N - explicitly\
        \ stating a difference in values rather than equality. The NO is based on\
        \ one location being south of the other, not because the values are the same."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific latitude coordinates to support
        its conclusion that Highbridge Senior Center is south of Morris II Houses.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        including in bold and as the final "ANSWER: YES". The model concludes that
        since the Highbridge Senior Center is at 170th Street and Morris II Houses

        Hope Gardens is farther north. The NO is not based on equal values, but rather
        on a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that the Red Carpet Inn is south
        of Hope Gardens, not north. This is a direct comparative answer to the original
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the classification rules,
        regardless of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be a history of the internet
        rather than an answer about the relative locations of diplomatic buildings
        in Manhattan. The model did not provide any YES/NO answer to the original
        comparison question, instead providing completely unrelated content.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with an explanation that the Italy Mission (44th St) is
        north of the Belgium Consulate (40th-41st St)
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        as the response was incomplete), this automatically results in False according
        to the criteria. The model never reached a point of comparing the relative
        positions or declaring them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        while still analyzing the locations. The model never reaches a final YES/NO
        conclusion about whether one location is north of the other. While it provides
        detailed analysis of address numbering systems and locations, it doesn't complete
        the comparison.

    b79f1a41-51db-411f-ad0b-b3756aea5d5a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        locations (mid-40s vs upper 80s streets) and explicitly states the Italy Mission
        is south of the Belgium Consulate. The NO is not due to equal values but due
        to a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning showing the Italy Mission
        is south of the Belgium Consulate.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Independence
        Park is south of PS 11, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference, with Independence Park being in
        Midland Beach which is "south along the eastern shore" from Dongan Hills where
        PS 11 is located.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer based on its analysis
        of the relative locations, with Independence Park being south of PS 11.'

    76cf2f96-393c-41e0-9ce1-7cb226b93ba5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion about whether Independence Park is
        north of PS 11. The response ends mid-thought with "Alternatively, the park"
        and shows uncertainty throughout, considering multiple possible locations
        without settling on a final answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8be0e79d-1e69-4550-964e-0349baa7b5bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Independence Park is south
        of PS 11 (a directional difference), and this difference in location is the
        reason for the NO answer. The fact that one location is south of the other
        means they are not at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Independence Park is
        not north of PS 11. The model provides a definitive comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        \ Independence Park is at a lower latitude (40.6148\xB0 N) than PS 11 (40.6357\xB0\
        \ N) and describes Independence Park as being \"south of PS11\" and \"geographically\
        \ southeast\" of Port Richmond where PS 11 is located."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        with detailed reasoning about why Independence Park is south of PS 11, not
        north of it. The answer is clear and definitive.

        of equal values is not relevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a definitive conclusion. While it seems to be leaning towards
        YES at points ("Therefore, the answer would be YES"), it then continues to
        question and analyze further possibilities without providing a final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with the
        Senior Center being in the southern part of Manhattan (Pike Street) and the
        Playground being far north (90th Street). The NO is because one location is
        definitively south of the other.

        the locations are equal/same/identical; rather it explicitly states they are
        in different parts of Queens.

        difference, with Bayside being "further north" than Bellerose. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        one location (the firehouse on 30th Drive) is north of the other location
        (the square on 30th Avenue). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, explaining that the square is not located north of the firehouse

        difference - the Boys Club is on 10th Street which is north of the NYU residence
        on 7th Street. The NO answer was given because one location was definitively
        south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that the locations are different, with PS 32 being north of PS 58 (in Greenpoint
        and Carroll Gardens respectively). The NO answer was given because PS 58 is
        specifically described as being south of PS 32, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that PS 58 is not

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model appears confused about
        the location of Pier 96 and keeps considering different possibilities without
        reaching a definitive answer. While it suggests "NO" at several points, these

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that Building 5 is part of
        Group 4, and therefore the group as a whole cannot be north of one of its
        own buildings because it encompasses all buildings within it. This is a logical
        relationship reason, not an equality reason.

        the model discusses the possibility that Building 5 is part of Group 4 and
        therefore they can't be separate, it never reaches a final NO conclusion based
        on equality or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends abruptly without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities and seems
        to lean towards NO at points (saying "therefore, the answer would be NO" in
        some parts), it doesn't actually make a final determination. The response

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never gave
        a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison. While it extensively analyzed various possibilities, it ultimately
        concluded that the question "doesn't make sense" because a group cannot be
        north of its own building, suggesting the premises of the question are problematic.

      explanation_final_answer: The model spent a long time reasoning but never actually
        provided a final YES/NO answer. It ended mid-thought with "I might have to
        say" without completing the statement. While it mentioned "Perhaps the answer
        is YES" at one point, this was just speculation and not a final conclusion.

        the response discusses various scenarios where the locations might be related
        or part of the same complex, this is irrelevant since we didn't get a final
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        never explicitly states a final YES/NO answer. While it explores various possibilities
        and seems to lean towards NO at points, it doesn't definitively conclude with
        a clear comparative answer.

        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        and mentions "perhaps the answer is NO" at one point, it continues reasoning
        and ends with "Wait" without making a final determination. The response shows

        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-sentence)

        Houses complex, and therefore the complex as a whole cannot be north of one
        of its own buildings. This is a logical relationship reason, not an equality
        reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or identical. Rather, it's based on the logical argument that
        a complex cannot be entirely north of one of its own buildings. The model
        suggests the buildings are arranged in various directions relative to each
        other, indicating different positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Coney Island Houses cannot be north of Building
        3 because Building 3 is part of the complex itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that the comparison is invalid
        because one location (Building 3) is a component of the other (Coney Island
        Houses), making it impossible for the complex to be north of its own building.
        This is a logical/structural reason, not an equality-based reason.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical. Rather, it argues that the comparison is illogical
        because one location (Building 3) is contained within the other (Coney Island
        Houses complex). The model explains that the complex "encompasses all the
        buildings" but doesn't state they are at the same location or coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that the comparison is invalid
        because one location (Building 3) is a component of the other location (the
        entire complex). The model argues that the complex cannot be entirely north
        of one of its own buildings, which is a logical relationship argument rather
        than an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and reiterates
        this answer with clear reasoning about why the complex cannot be north of
        one of its own buildings. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because Building 3
        is a constituent part of Coney Island Houses, making the comparison invalid
        ("the entire development cannot be located north of one of its own constituent
        buildings"). This is a logical relationship reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with an explanation, making it a clear comparative result
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the NO was based on logical
        reasoning that a complex cannot be entirely north of one of its own buildings.
        The model never states the locations are equal or identical - rather, it explains
        that one is a subset of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear explanation for why - because Building 3 is part of the larger Coney
        Island Houses complex, so the complex cannot be entirely north of one of its
        own buildings.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Gateway
        Center is south of the playground, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer was given because one location is
        definitively south of the other, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion that Gateway Center is south of the playground,
        not north. The answer is explicitly stated both in the one-word response "NO"
        and in the final summary paragraph.

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference - the Gateway Center is south of the playground (near Belt Parkway)
        while the playground is north (on Linden Boulevard).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a directional explanation
        that the Gateway Center is south of the playground, not north.

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking and analysis
        but never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering alternatives
        and different possible locations, getting confused about addresses and coordinates,
        and ends mid-thought with "But if". There is no final comparative statement
        or answer given.

        Center is), indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative explanation that Marshall's Gateway Center is not north of Detective
        Dillon Stewart Playground, because the playground is in East Flatbush which
        is north of Spring Creek where the Gateway Center is located.

        is actually north of PAL based on neighborhood locations (Cypress Hills being
        north of East New York). The model explicitly states a difference in north-south
        positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO, the PAL is not
        north of the playground" after analyzing the neighborhoods and determining
        that since PAL is in East New York (south) and the playground is in Cypress
        Hills (north), PAL must be south of the playground.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference in location - the school is at 113th Street while St. Nicholas
        Houses Building 9 is at 127th Street. The model explicitly states this difference
        and uses it as the basis for its answer. The values are not equal or same,
        but rather distinctly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, explaining that the school is south of St. Nicholas Houses Building
        9. This is a direct comparative answer to the question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same place. Instead, it explicitly states there is
        a difference in street numbers (123rd vs 131st) and uses this difference to
        conclude that one location is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed explanation of why the school is south
        of (not north of) the housing building based on street numbers.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in street numbers (118th vs 129th) and used this difference to conclude that
        one location was south of the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the two locations (118th St vs 129th St)

        in locations (113th St vs 127th St), not because the locations are the same.
        The model explicitly states that one location is south of the other, indicating
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that the school is not north of the housing complex. The
        answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear directional
        difference - it states that the school is at 118th St while the housing complex
        is around 129th St, and explicitly concludes the school is south of the complex.
        The NO is not due to equal values, but due to the opposite directional relationship
        being true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the locations and concluding
        that the school is south of the housing complex.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final answer in bold stating "**Answer:** YES". The model was confident
        in its comparative assessment based on street numbers and Manhattan's grid
        system.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a difference in location - the school is on 118th Street while the building
        is on 129th Street, with the school being south of the building. The NO was
        because one location was definitively south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that the school is south of the building, not north as
        asked in the question. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values (118th Street vs 129th Street), not on equality. The model explicitly
        states that one location is south of the other because 118 is lower than 129.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on street numbers (118th
        vs 129th) and Manhattan's north-south geography.

    ffc985ae-a387-47c8-8b48-dc0048f3848a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        school is on 118th Street while St. Nicholas Houses Building 9 is between
        127th-131st Streets - a clear difference in location (not equality). The model
        explicitly states the school is "south" of the building, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer after analyzing the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were at equal positions - it actually described them as being at
        different locations with Brownsville being north of Red Hook.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model initially states "NO" but then corrects
        itself and explicitly states "The answer should be YES" and "Correct Answer:
        YES" at the end. Since the model explicitly provides YES as its final comparative

        since we didn't reach a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final, explicit conclusion. While it explores various ways
        to determine the relative positions and mentions "NO" at one point when considering
        coordinates, it then immediately questions those coordinates and continues

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal - rather, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in latitude of about 0.016 degrees (approximately 1.1 miles), with Red Hook
        being north of East New York where Jerome Gardens is located. The NO answer
        is given because Jerome Gardens is determined to be south of Red Hook, not
        because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: "The response appears to be cut off mid-thought, but\

        never concluded the locations were equal - in fact, it couldn't even determine
        one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not reach a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it explored various possibilities and found coordinates for Lynne's
        Riding School, it could not determine the location of Nakks Malls and ended
        with uncertainty ("But without knowing exactly where Nakks Malls is, how can
        I answer?"). The response was cut off with "Wait," but no final comparative
        answer was given.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions due to them being hypothetical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and then explains
        this is because the places are hypothetical and it cannot make a definitive
        geographic comparison without real-world data. Since the model is rejecting
        the premises of the question (stating these places don't exist) and indicating
        it cannot determine the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in locations - the Cruise Terminal is at 55th Street while the Church is at
        74th Street. The model explicitly states this difference and uses it as the
        basis for its conclusion. It does not claim the locations are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that the Manhattan
        Cruise Terminal is south of the Church of the Epiphany, not north.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    73dd37ce-7a07-4f8a-aed4-aad477ee27e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in locations (50th St vs 74th St), not on equality. It explicitly states the
        terminal is south of the church due to this difference in street numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on
        the relative positions (terminal at ~50th St being south of church at 74th
        St)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in location (55th Street vs 74th Street), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states that one location is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that the cruise terminal is south of
        the church, not north of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    87dfb764-2dc0-44ea-8b8b-335b41c62392:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position - in fact, it explicitly states they are at different locations
        (50th Street vs 73rd Street) and uses this difference to conclude that one
        is south of the other. The NO answer is based on the cruise terminal being
        south of the church, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that the cruise terminal is south
        of the church, not north.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9e785afb-fd9e-489d-89dc-ceb6fd6eb86a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - the cruise terminal is at 55th Street which is south of the church
        at 74th Street. The NO answer was given because one location is specifically
        south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a detailed explanation of why the Manhattan Cruise
        Terminal is south of (not north of) the Church of the Epiphany based on their
        street numbers (55th vs 74th).
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a63b7eda-f467-4ae2-aadc-f15d7658bbd5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the locations
        were different, with the cruise terminal at 55th Street and the church at
        74th Street, and used this difference to conclude that the cruise terminal
        is south of the church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a specific comparative
        reasoning about relative positions (cruise terminal being south of the church).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various scenarios
        where the answer could be YES or NO depending on the day care's location in
        Brooklyn, it doesn't commit to either answer. The response shows extensive
        reasoning but remains uncertain due to the missing specific location of the
        day care center.

        The model never gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. It repeatedly considers both possibilities
        and ends with uncertainty, stating "without specific addresses, this is speculative."
        The response concludes with "Maybe the answer hinges on the fact that the
        medical office is in Staten Island, which overall is south of most of Brooklyn"
        but doesn't commit to a final answer.

        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate
        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and
        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model explores various
        possibilities and coordinates, it continues to hedge with statements like
        "depends on specific location" and "perhaps" without making a definitive comparative
        statement.

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a final YES/NO answer. The model spends time analyzing various possibilities
        and coordinates but trails off mid-sentence without reaching a conclusion.
        The response ends abruptly while still considering hypothetical locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Staten
        Island is south of Brooklyn and uses this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model specifically says "Staten Island is geographically
        south of Brooklyn" and uses this difference in position as the basis for its
        conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional conclusion that the Staten Island location is south
        of the Brooklyn location.

        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model discusses various possibilities (both
        YES and NO depending on specific locations), it never commits to a final answer.
        The response shows the model's reasoning process but ends without reaching
        a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the analysis, the model repeatedly states
        that the answer depends on where in Brooklyn the daycare is located, oscillating
        between YES (if in southern Brooklyn) and NO (if in northern Brooklyn), but
        never commits to a final answer.

        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a final YES/NO answer. While it explores various possibilities (YES if the
        church is in southern Brooklyn, NO if in northern Brooklyn), it never commits
        to a final answer. The response shows uncertainty about the exact location
        of the church and ends without resolution.

        the church is in Brighton Beach... if the church is in northern Brooklyn...")
        without making a final determination. The response shows uncertainty about

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that one school is in northern Brooklyn (Bedford-Stuyvesant)
        while the other is in central Brooklyn (near Prospect Park), and concludes
        that Parkside is south of Explore. The NO is not due to the locations being
        equal or the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Explore is
        in a more northern area (Crown Heights North) compared to Parkside (Flatbush),
        indicating a clear difference in their positions. The NO answer is based on
        Parkside being south of Explore, not on them being at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that Williamsburg is north of Red Hook, making the
        yeshiva north of the playground. The model does not claim the locations are
        at the same coordinates or elevation; rather, it identifies a clear directional
        difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional explanation for why - because the playground is
        in Red Hook (southern Brooklyn) while the yeshiva is in Williamsburg (northern
        Brooklyn).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        even when the model considered NO as a possibility, it was always due to one
        location being south of the other, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear final answer. While it considers multiple possibilities
        and leans towards "NO" at points, it keeps second-guessing itself with "but
        I need to confirm" and "alternatively maybe." The response ends mid-thought
        without providing a definitive conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that Williamsburg (Yeshiva's location) is north of Cypress Hills
        (playground's location). The NO answer was given because the playground is
        south of the Yeshiva, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that Bartlett Playground
        is not north of the Yeshiva because Williamsburg (where the Yeshiva is) lies
        north of Cypress Hills (where the playground is).

        never concluded the locations were equal - it actually spent the entire response
        trying to determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive conclusion. The model keeps considering different possibilities
        ("if it's in Greenpoint then yes, but if it's in Williamsburg then maybe not")
        and the response actually cuts off mid-thought. No clear YES/NO answer is
        provided.

        considered, it was based on different coordinate values (40.7144 vs 40.7048),
        not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers various
        possibilities and at one point says "Hence, the answer would be NO," it immediately
        follows this with doubt ("But wait, I'm making assumptions here") and continues

        there is a directional difference - the Bronx location is north of the Manhattan
        location. The model concludes NO because the Manhattanville building is south
        of the Pre-K Center, not because they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        states that the Bronx (where one location is) lies north of Manhattan (where
        the other location is), indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on the fact that the Manhattan location is
        south of the Bronx location, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if it was due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it reasons extensively about relative locations and street numbers,
        it ends mid-thought with "Wait, but" and doesn't provide a final comparative

        conclusion based on equality or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        with "But the question is asking if the Manhattanville building is north".
        The model goes through extensive reasoning about relative locations but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various possibilities,
        it doesn't make a definitive comparative statement.

        when the model discusses potential NO scenarios, it's based on relative positions
        (southwest vs northeast) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear final answer. While it considers "NO" at several points, these
        are part of hypothetical scenarios ("Therefore, the answer would be NO") rather

        (Gowanus Houses being "south and west" of the garden), not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lights are at the
        same location or have equal values. Instead, it concludes NO because Light
        58 is positioned further north than Light 42 based on navigational numbering
        conventions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a comparative directional conclusion that Light 58 is north of
        Light 42.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lights are at equal
        positions - instead, it explicitly concludes that Light 58 is further north
        than Light 42 based on navigational numbering conventions. The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a comparative directional conclusion that Light 58 is north of
        Light 42, making Light 42 not north of Light 58.

    e0cd7c12-f9de-454d-8da6-5f36dad217b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lights are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states they
        are at different locations, with Light 42 being south of Light 58. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison that Light 42 is south of
        Light 58, not north.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so the question of equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explores multiple possibilities but never
        reaches a definitive conclusion. While it considers "YES" at one point based
        on ICW numbering, it immediately expresses uncertainty about whether that
        system applies. The response ends mid-sentence with "But" suggesting incomplete
        analysis. No clear final answer is given.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        locations - FDNY Academy at around 124th St and the Yeshiva at 157th St. The
        NO is based on this difference in location (one being south of the other),
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        it explicitly states different locations (103rd Street vs 182nd Street) and
        gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer, with 103rd being south
        of 182nd
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that the FDNY Academy is not

        at 185th Street is "significantly farther north" than the FDNY Academy location
        (near 103rd Street). The NO is because one location is definitively north
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that the FDNY Academy is
        not north of the Yeshiva because the Yeshiva is actually north of the FDNY
        Academy.

        locations were different - specifically that the academy is at 125th St latitude
        while the yeshiva is at 181st St. The NO was not due to the locations being
        equal/same, but rather because one location was explicitly south of the other.

        difference - the FDNY Academy is south of the Yeshiva, with specific street
        numbers (125th vs 180th) showing different latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a specific directional explanation - that the FDNY Academy is
        south of the Yeshiva because Washington Heights (180th St) is farther north
        than Randalls Island (125th St latitude).

        6 is at 114th Street while Amsterdam Residence is at 118th Street, and uses
        this difference in street numbers to conclude that one is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that Washington Houses Building 6 is not north of
        Amsterdam Residence, providing specific street numbers to support this comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" twice - once as
        a one-word answer and again in the final summary, concluding that Washington
        Houses Building 6 is north of Amsterdam Residence because it's at 99th-104th
        Streets while Amsterdam Residence is at 76th Street.

        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant difference
        in location, with Amsterdam Residence being at 134th Street and Washington
        Houses Building 6 being around 97th-99th Streets. The model specifically notes
        that Amsterdam Residence is "significantly north" of Washington Houses.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: "While the final answer was NO, it was not because\
        \ the values being compared are equal. The model explicitly states the NO\
        \ is because \"Williamsburg, Manhattan\" doesn't exist (premise is invalid).\
        \ In fact, when comparing actual coordinates, the model notes a difference\
        \ (Hillman Houses at ~40.7167\xB0 N vs Williamsburg, Brooklyn at ~40.7081\xB0\
        \ N)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" in bold,
        stating this answer is due to the premise being invalid since Williamsburg,
        Manhattan does not exist. While the model discusses alternative interpretations,
        it clearly commits to NO as its final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Hillman Houses is south of the reference point (Williamsburg/Williamsburg
        Bridge Manhattan side), not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Hillman Houses being south of that")
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it notes confusion about one of the locations. The model
        commits to this directional comparison based on its understanding of the relative
        positions, so this is a clear NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses concerns about the premise
        (Williamsburg being in Manhattan), it does not give equality of locations
        as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explicitly states that Hillman
        Houses is SOUTH of the reference point (Williamsburg Bridge's Manhattan entrance),
        making this a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, making a clear comparative directional statement that
        Hillman Houses is south of the reference point (Williamsburg Bridge's Manhattan
        entrance), even while noting issues with the premise.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer primarily on
        equal values. While it mentions that some parts are "roughly at the same latitude,"
        this is not presented as the main reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model
        primarily bases its NO on the fact that Williamsburg doesn't exist in Manhattan,
        and when comparing to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Hillman Houses is actually in
        southern Manhattan with parts of Williamsburg being further north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the step-by-step thinking and in the final conclusion. While it discusses
        various complications with the premise, it ultimately provides a clear NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty about the exact
        nature of "Williamsburg, Manhattan," it did not give its NO answer because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Hillman Houses
        is south of the reference point (Williamsburg Bridge's Manhattan entrance
        near Delancey Street), indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "ANSWER: NO" after providing directional reasoning
        (Hillman Houses being south of the referenced area). While the model expresses

        directional differences, stating that the school is in Soundview (southeastern
        Bronx) while the playground is near Bronx Park East, with the school being
        south of the playground. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Young Women's Leadership
        School of the Bronx is not north of the Playground for All Children" as its
        final comparative conclusion. This is a direct, explicit NO answer to the
