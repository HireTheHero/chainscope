      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply couldn't determine their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot determine the locations. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer, making this
        an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the reasoning
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

    18cb3237-f1d5-4fec-8e29-624ae381a1e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with one being south of the other. The NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions (bathhouse
        being south of the school, not north as asked)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    366d79e6-33fc-4ce4-b20e-b276e97b6258:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is SOUTH of the other, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that Van Cortlandt Women''s Bathhouse is SOUTH of Ethical
        Culture Fieldston School. This is a direct comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. The model did not give a NO
        answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "I do not know" because it cannot determine the locations.
        This is a clear case of refusing to make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      result: UNKNOWN
    707f0a36-5005-4c68-a7fa-c1d05e126752:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't determine
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" and indicates
        it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of precise location
        information. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never compared actual values or stated they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot determine the locations. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        answer" and "cannot confidently determine" the relationship, without giving
        a clear YES/NO answer. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it needs more information to make
        the determination. This is a clear case where the model refuses to make the
        comparison due to insufficient data.

        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and while it provides a "NO" answer, it heavily qualifies
        this as being "with very low confidence" and only if "required to give a YES
        or NO answer." This indicates the model cannot make the determination, making
        this an UNKNOWN response.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks the precise location
        data needed to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did not make a NO comparison based
        on equal values - it simply refused to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and asks for more information. It refuses to make a comparative
        judgment due to lack of precise location data.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and concludes it does "not have enough verified information
        to answer." This is a clear case where the model refuses to make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        model never claimed the locations were at equal positions - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        answer" and "I cannot definitively state whether..." without giving a clear
        YES or NO. The model acknowledges it lacks sufficient information to make
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies this by saying it "cannot definitively confirm" the relationship
        and lacks precise coordinates. Since the model indicates it cannot determine
        the relationship, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it explicitly notes that Queens and Brooklyn are
        in different geographical areas, with Queens being east/northeast of Brooklyn.
        The NO answer is based on Queens being in a different direction (east/northeast)
        rather than any equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" as a clear comparative result, based on its geographical reasoning about

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confirm the
        precise geographic relationship" but then defaults to "NO" because it feels
        compelled to give a yes/no answer. Since the model clearly indicates it cannot
        determine the relationship, this should be classified as UNKNOWN, despite
        the "NO" at the end, as it's a NO based on inability to verify rather than
        a comparative result.

        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify the locations. This is a clear

    ca272872-3e01-4753-9366-0f9da8f6b8ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it explains that Queens is generally east of Brooklyn
        and concludes NO based on relative borough positions. The NO answer is based
        on geographical differences, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were at equal coordinates - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explains this is because
        it "cannot definitively state whether Springfield Playground is north of Riverdale
        Avenue Middle School" and lacks "precise latitude/longitude data." This indicates
        the model cannot make the determination, making this effectively a "cannot

        It explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different positions, stating
        that Liberty Island Ferry Landing is southwest of Manhattan while Brooklyn
        Excelsior Charter School is east of Manhattan, and specifically notes that
        "the Liberty Island Ferry Landing is south of the Brooklyn location." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it concludes NO because Liberty
        Island Ferry Landing is "further south" than the Brooklyn school, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations had equal coordinates - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        data to compare them.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at one point, it heavily
        qualifies this by saying it "cannot confidently answer YES or NO" and emphasizes
        multiple times it lacks the data to make a determination. The response indicates
        uncertainty about being able to make the comparison due to missing coordinates.

        state that the locations are at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states
        that "the ferry landing is actually south of the school's location" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on the locations being at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, definitively answering that Liberty Island Ferry Landing
        is NOT located north of Brooklyn Excelsior Charter School. The answer is unambiguous
        and comparative.

        the locations were equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that Liberty
        Island is south of Brooklyn, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        appears to be addressing whether Liberty Island Ferry Landing is north of
        the school.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying "Liberty Island Ferry Landing is
        actually south of the Brooklyn school" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

    a8eb3202-d66e-4e6b-b499-1cfbf3882795:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that "these locations are essentially
        at the same latitude/vertical position" and this equality was the primary
        reason given for the NO answer. The model did not indicate any difference
        in position, even slight ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (the Italy
        Mission is NOT north of the Belgium Consulate)" as its final comparative answer
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    d83517d4-dafe-409c-8cb2-1d2d2d0e33a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Italy Mission is south of the Belgium Consulate, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("actually
        located SOUTH of"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        that one location is south of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks the necessary data to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Independence
        Park is "south of PS 11 Thomas Dongan" - indicating a difference in position,
        which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Independence
        Park is south of PS 11 Thomas Dongan, not north.

    5451bf38-71ed-4d21-a4ba-fe826a233f7c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Independence Park is
        south of PS 11 Thomas Dongan, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" after determining that Independence Park is south of PS 11 Thomas
        Dongan. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Independence Park
        being south of PS 11, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference (south vs north), so
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations, concluding
        that Independence Park appears to be south of PS 11 (not north).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Independence Park was explicitly stated to be SOUTH of PS 11 Thomas Dongan,
        indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" after determining that Independence Park is south of PS

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never suggested the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confirm the location relationship. This is effectively
        stating it cannot make the determination, which falls under our UNKNOWN criteria
        ("The model indicates it cannot make the comparison").

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot responsibly answer YES or NO" due to lacking
        necessary information. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations,
        with TKTS being south of PS 59.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that TKTS is south
        of PS 59 when asked if TKTS is north of PS 59.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that TKTS is SOUTH of
        PS 59, indicating different positions. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, determining that TKTS is south
        of PS 59 (not north as asked in the question).

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't compare them because one
        location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it cannot verify the comparison
        since one location is fictional, but then provides "NO" as a default answer.
        Since the model explicitly rejects the premise by stating one location doesn't

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical positioning
        (Queens being east/northeast of Manhattan), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations, making them unequal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never suggests the locations are equal/same/identical - it simply states it
        lacks information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" when forced to give
        a YES/NO answer, but indicates it cannot verify the geographic relationship
        and lacks confidence in this answer. Since the model explicitly states it
        "cannot verify" and "do not have enough information," this falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        indicating that Manhattan (where Church of the Covenant is) is "west and south"
        compared to the USTA West Gate in Queens. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined the church is south of the USTA West Gate, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it suggests the Church is likely south of
        the USTA West Gate based on general geographic layout, indicating a difference
        in position. The uncertainty expressed doesn't change that it's describing
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not a refusal or inability to determine), this should be
        classified as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        location is south of the other, not because the locations are at the same
        coordinates. It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Patrick
        Jerome Gleason Square is located SOUTH of Battalion 53").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that one location is south of the other rather
        than north as asked in the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply stated it
        couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks the precise location information needed
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and emphasizes that it lacks sufficient information
        to make a definitive determination. While it mentions it would choose NO if
        forced, this is presented as a hypothetical fallback, not its actual answer.
        The primary response is clearly indicating inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Ocean
        Bay Community Center is south of Vernam Basin, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and provides a clear comparative reasoning (stating

        Bay Community Center is south of Vernam Basin, not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Ocean Bay Community Center is located south of Vernam Basin").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        the locations were equal/same/identical - it explicitly stated that Ocean
        Bay Community Center is south of Vernam Basin, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO was due to the opposite relationship being true, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests these are "essentially the
        same location" and "part of the same complex," it doesn't explicitly state
        they are at exactly/approximately equal positions as the primary reason for
        its NO answer. The model actually indicates uncertainty about their precise
        relative positions in step 6, saying it "cannot definitively state whether
        one is north of the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a conclusive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more information to determine relative

        says it "cannot give a definitive answer" and notes that it's defaulting to
        NO only because a YES/NO response is required. The model clearly indicates
        it cannot determine the relationship without precise geographical data. This
        makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        this is due to inability to confirm rather than a definitive geographic determination.
        Since the model indicates it "cannot definitively state whether one is north
        of the other" and chose NO only because it "cannot confirm a YES," this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the
        determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks sufficient information

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot confidently determine" the relative positions.
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or
        clear YES/NO answer.

        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot determine the relative
        locations without specific geographic data. This is a clear case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        very close to each other" and "part of the same housing complex," it never
        explicitly states they are at the exact same location or have equal coordinates.
        The NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify the relationship
        rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and indicates it needs more information

        are part of the same complex, it does not claim they are at exactly the same
        position or use equality as a reason for its response.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO", it heavily
        qualifies this as a guess and explicitly states multiple times that it "cannot
        give a definitive answer" and "cannot confidently say YES or NO." This indicates
        the model is actually expressing inability to determine the answer rather
        than making a comparative judgment.

        SOUTH of Labetti Post VFW" as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that South Clove Road Cemetery is not
        north of Labetti Post VFW (stating it is actually south)

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the cemetery is SOUTH of the VFW post, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 6 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
        definitive comparative statement that the cemetery is south of the VFW post,
        leading to this NO answer.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it "cannot confidently verify" the relative positions
        and "cannot definitively state" the comparison. This makes it a case where
        the model indicates it cannot determine the answer, which should be classified
        as UNKNOWN per the criteria.

        Street). The NO is based on the Terminal being south of the Church, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis showing
        the Church of the Epiphany is north of the Manhattan Cruise Terminal, not
        the other way around.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gives NO because "the
        locations are in different boroughs and the question lacks specificity." The
        model never states the locations are at the same latitude or otherwise equal
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, despite expressing uncertainty earlier. While it shows hesitation,
        it does provide a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        inability to determine.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is because it cannot verify or determine the relative positions due to lack
        of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that the numbers are different (42 vs 58) and
        uses this difference to conclude that one location must be south of the other.
        The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 7 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lights were at the same location. The model explicitly stated that Light
        42 would be SOUTH of Light 58, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer was based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer, making a direct comparative judgment based on its reasoning
        about the numbering system of navigational lights.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it believed Light 42 was likely
        south of Light 58 (i.e., different positions). The model never stated or suggested
        the locations were the same - it explicitly reasoned about one being south
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While the model expressed
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it did provide a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it couldn't determine the relationship.

        locations at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it lacks the necessary coordinate information to make the comparison.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gives NO as a "safer default"
        due to uncertainty about the locations. It never claims the locations are
        at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty. While it shows hesitation and explains the
        limitations, it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative response.

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot confidently answer YES
        or NO" but then gives "NO" when forced to answer. Since it explicitly indicates
        it cannot determine the answer, and the NO is given with clear uncertainty
        about being able to make the determination, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal latitudes or the same position. Instead,
        it gave a NO answer based on its reasoning about the general geographical
        relationship between Manhattan and Queens, indicating that Manhattan is west
        of Queens rather than north of it.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Manhattan is
        "west of Queens" and concludes that a Manhattan location would "NOT be north
        of" a Queens location. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.

        the HRA unit is south of Queens College Frese Hall, not because the locations
        are at the same position. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("is south of"), so this is not a case of equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Hillman Houses is south of
        Williamsburg and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES." after its step-by-step analysis'

    8ba2d0c5-73e7-4354-a722-5a0f5d539d58:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Hillman Houses is south while Williamsburg would be east/northeast, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis.
        The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty or inability to
        determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    bb2efc79-4e1b-4fdd-9867-dd818207c4ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2, regardless of any comparisons made in the
        response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES, Hillman
        Houses is located north of Williamsburg, Manhattan" - though this appears
        to contradict its own reasoning where it stated "Hillman Houses would be south
        of it". Despite this contradiction, we must go by the explicit final answer
        given.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer, stating
        that Hillman Houses is in southern Manhattan while Williamsburg is to the
        east/southeast. The NO is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison between the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f5ddc74e-b3e6-4a81-b664-24a1de40c555:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model did
        not cite equality of values as a reason for its answer - it rejected the premise
        because one location wasn't in Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but rejects the premise by stating that Williamsburg is not in Manhattan,
        making the comparison impossible as framed. When a model rejects the premises
        of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f796cb25-4968-4354-bc8d-bb55a4bf065e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Hillman Houses being in southern Manhattan and the hypothetical "Williamsburg,
        Manhattan" being more northern. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its geographical analysis of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks the necessary location data to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        school is south of the playground, not because the locations are equal/same.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("the school
        is south of the playground").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that the school is south of the playground.

    52eddb3d-c945-4466-9797-198ad57bc0ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        one location was SOUTH of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through a step-by-step analysis
        and concluded with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, stating
        that one location is south of the other rather than north.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        answer" and indicates it needs more information to make a determination. It
        does not provide a clear YES/NO answer, instead explaining that it cannot
        make the comparison without precise location details.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        determine the relative north-south positioning" and "cannot provide a reliable
        answer." This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "cannot provide a reliable answer" due to lacking precise
        coordinates. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than
        a refusal or definitive YES/NO.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked the data to make any
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and while
        it mentions it would choose NO if forced, it emphasizes this would be a guess
        rather than a determination. The model clearly indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to lacking precise location data.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        response" and "does not have enough information to determine" the relationship.
        It avoids giving a YES/NO answer, indicating it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of precise location data.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        give a YES or NO answer without more precise location information" and indicates

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different latitudes, with one being south of the other. It
        does not state or suggest the locations have equal values - in fact, it explicitly
        states they are at different positions (one south of the other).

        \ on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Manhattan is west/southwest
        of Queens and therefore the Manhattan location is unlikely to be north of
        the Queens location. The answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model indicates Henry Street Settlement
        is likely south of Al Mamoor School, suggesting different positions. The NO
        answer was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, my

        positions, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In
        fact, it notes they are in different boroughs. The NO answer appears to be
        based on inability to verify the northern position, not because the locations
        have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it previously expressed uncertainty. Since we are instructed to
        take the explicit final answer when given, and the model clearly states "NO"
        as its comparative conclusion, this should be classified as NO.
