      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Morris II Houses
        Building 14 is located further north than Highbridge Senior Center, noting
        that "Morris II Houses Building 14 is around East 169th Street" while "Highbridge
        Senior Center is around West 167th Street." The model concludes that "Since
        169 is a higher street number than 167, Morris II Houses Building 14 is located
        further north." The model is clearly identifying a difference in position,
        not equality.

        equal. Rather, the model explains that Springfield Playground is primarily
        east (not north) of Riverdale Avenue Middle School. While the model notes
        they are at "similar latitudes," it doesn't claim they're at exactly the same
        latitude or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The model is saying
        the playground is not north of the school, but rather to the east or possibly
        even slightly south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that Springfield Playground is not
        north of Riverdale Avenue Middle School, explaining that the locations are
        at similar latitudes and Springfield Playground is primarily east (not north)
        of Riverdale Avenue Middle School.

        indicating a clear directional difference in their locations. The model does
        not claim the locations are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear and explicit "NO" as its
        final answer. The model states "Therefore, since Red Carpet Inn Hotel is in
        southern Brooklyn while Hope Gardens is in northern Brooklyn, Red Carpet Inn
        Hotel is NOT located north of Hope Gardens Building 4. NO" This is a definitive
        comparative statement with an explicit NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with RED CARPET INN HOTEL being south of HOPE GARDENS BUILDING
        4 (not north). The model concludes that Bushwick (where Hope Gardens is) is
        north of East New York (where Red Carpet Inn is), indicating a clear directional
        difference.

        that "Bushwick is clearly north of East New York/Brownsville" and concludes
        that "the hotel is positioned south of Hope Gardens." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is RED CARPET INN HOTEL, Brooklyn located north of HOPE GARDENS

        that the Belgium Consulate is at 53rd-54th Streets while the Italy Mission
        is at 47th Street, and since higher street numbers in Manhattan are further
        north, the Belgium Consulate is north of the Italy Mission.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Colonel Charles Young Triangle
        in Manhattan is south of Bronx International Academy in the Bronx, indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. The model's reasoning
        is based on the geographic relationship between Manhattan and the Bronx, stating
        that "Manhattan as a whole is south of the Bronx" and "locations in Manhattan
        are generally south of locations in the Bronx."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it does not
        state that the locations have equal values (same latitude). Instead, the model
        explains that Bronx International Academy is likely north of Colonel Charles
        Young Triangle, indicating a difference in their positions. The model argues
        that the Bronx is generally north of Manhattan, making it unlikely that a
        Manhattan location would be north of a Bronx location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model directly answers the comparative question about
        whether Colonel Charles Young Triangle is north of Bronx International Academy
        with a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.

        It explicitly says "TKTS Times Square is not located north of PS 59 Beekman
        Hill International School. It is actually located south of the school." This
        is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explains that PS 59 is on 56th Street while TKTS is
        on 47th Street, and since 56 > 47, PS 59 is further north than TKTS. The model
        is giving a NO answer because the relationship is the opposite of what was
        asked, not because the locations are the same.

        West Gate (at a latitude corresponding to upper 50s/lower 60s in Manhattan).
        The model clearly indicates a difference in latitude between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        not on the values being equal. The model explicitly states that the Church
        of the Covenant is south of the USTA West Gate, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The model explains that East 42nd Street
        is south of the East 60s-70s (which is where the USTA facility is aligned
        with). The model never claims the locations are at the same latitude or equal
        in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the Church
        of the Covenant is SOUTH of the USTA West Gate. The model determines that
        the Church at East 42nd Street is at a different (and specifically southern)
        latitude compared to the USTA facility, which it places at approximately the
        latitude of upper 60s/low 70s streets.

        doesn't apply. The model determined that one location is north of the other,
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear "YES" answer at the end
        of its response. After analyzing the locations of both places, it concludes

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on the model's determination that the Boys Club
        is on 10th Street, which is north of 7th Street where the NYU residence hall
        is located. The model explicitly states a difference in locations (7th Street
        vs. 10th Street) rather than claiming the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear and explicit "NO" as its
        final answer. After analyzing Manhattan's grid system and the locations of
        both places, the model concludes that since the Boys Club is on 10th Street
        and 10th Street is north of 7th Street, the NYU 7 ST RESIDENCE HALL is NOT
        north of the ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB.

        hall is on East 7th Street while the ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB is
        on East 10th Street, and concludes that one is south of the other. The model
        gives a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
        7 ST RESIDENCE HALL is not located north of the ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER

        equal. Instead, it's based on a directional comparison where it concludes
        that the Alternate Learning Center Boys Club is likely on 10th Street, which
        is north of the NYU residence hall on 7th Street. The model explicitly states
        this directional difference rather than claiming the locations are the same.

        that the ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB is north of NYU 7 ST RESIDENCE
        HALL (not the other way around), as East 10th Street is north of East 7th
        Street in Manhattan's grid system.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that NYU 7 ST RESIDENCE
        HALL is not north of ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER BOYS CLUB because the latter
        is on East 10th Street which is north of East 7th Street where the NYU residence
        hall is located.

        it places on 10th Street). The model explicitly states that "7th Street is
        south of 10th Street in Manhattan's grid system" as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        being equal. Instead, the model concluded that NYU 7 St Residence Hall is
        likely south of the Alternate Learning Center Boys Club because Manhattan
        streets are numbered from south to north, and the Boys Club is likely on a
        higher-numbered street (north of 7th Street).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that one cannot be north of the
        other because Building 5 is a component of Group 4, making it a logical impossibility
        (like saying "a neighborhood is north of a house within that neighborhood").
        This is not an equality-based reason but a containment/subset relationship
        reason.

        5 is part of the Group 4 complex, meaning they are not separate locations
        but rather one contains the other. The model explicitly states that the reason
        is because "Building 5 is part of the Group 4 complex" and compares it to
        asking if "New York City is located north of Manhattan." The model is saying
        they are the same location (or one contains the other), not that they have
        equal coordinate values.

        but a collection of buildings that includes Building 5 within it" and "it
        doesn't make logical sense to say that Group 4 as a whole is north of one

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, explaining
        that "Building 5 would be located further north" based on NYC housing numbering
        conventions. The model's reasoning is that buildings with higher numbers are
        generally located further north, not that the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provides a clear and explicit "NO" answer
        in its final conclusion. The model states "# Answer: NO" and then explains

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        Building 5 is a part of Group 4, not that they are equal or the same. The
        model explains that Group 4 encompasses Building 5, using the analogy "This
        is similar to asking if New York City is north of Manhattan - since Manhattan
        is part of NYC, the city as a whole isn't north of one of its components;
        it includes that component." The model is not claiming the values are equal,
        but rather that one is a subset of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes with "# Answer: NO" followed by the explanation "CLAREMONT
        REHABS GROUP 4 is not located north of CLAREMONT REHAB GROUP 4 BUILDING 5,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Building
        5 is part of Group 4, and therefore Group 4 cannot be exclusively north of
        Building 5. The model explains that "a collection cannot be located exclusively
        in one direction from one of its constituent parts." This is a logical relationship
        explanation, not an equality explanation. The model is not saying the values
        are equal or the same.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the
        question of whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer as I don't have the specific location information for these schools
        in the Bronx." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a definitive
        comparative answer due to lack of information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the RFK Bridge pedestrian
        and bike path in the Bronx is north of Cambridge Hotel in Manhattan. The model's
        reasoning is based on the geographic fact that "the Bronx borough sits north
        of Manhattan" and that the bridge path "must be north of any Manhattan location,
        including Cambridge Hotel." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model concludes that Cambridge Hotel in Manhattan
        is south of the RFK Bridge pedestrian and bike path in the Bronx. The model
        explains that Manhattan is south of the Bronx, and that even the southernmost
        points in the Bronx are north of most of Manhattan. The model does not state
        that the locations are at the same latitude or otherwise equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographic reasoning that Cambridge
        Hotel is south of the RFK Bridge pedestrian and bike access, indicating a
        directional difference between the two locations. The model explains that
        Manhattan is generally south of the Bronx, and even the northernmost parts
        of Manhattan are typically south of where the RFK Bridge connects to the Bronx.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Cambridge Hotel
        in Manhattan is not located north of the RFK Bridge pedestrian and bike access
        in the Bronx" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical reasoning
        about the relative positions of Manhattan and the Bronx, not because the values
        being compared are equal. The model explains that the Bronx is north of Manhattan,
        and the pedestrian path in the Bronx would be north of any hotel in Manhattan.
        The model never states that the locations are at the same coordinates or equal
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        as its final answer to whether the Cambridge Hotel in Manhattan is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Cambridge Hotel in Manhattan
        is south of the RFK Bridge pedestrian entrance because Manhattan is entirely
        south of the Bronx. The model is indicating a directional difference (south
        vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes "The Cambridge Hotel in Manhattan cannot be north of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Manhattan is geographically south of the Bronx. The model is stating
        there is a clear directional difference (south vs. north) between the locations,
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The answer is explicitly stated as "Cambridge Hotel

        that Manhattan is south of the Bronx, and therefore the Cambridge Hotel in
        Manhattan must be south of (not north of) the RFK Bridge pedestrian/bike path
        in the Bronx. The model is making a clear directional distinction between
        the locations.

        HOUSES is the entire housing complex that encompasses BUILDING 3, and therefore
        cannot be strictly north of one of its parts. The reason for the NO is based
        on a whole-part relationship (the complex contains the building), not that
        they are equal or identical locations.

        being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model gave a NO answer
        because it determined that the housing development (CONEY ISLAND HOUSES) includes
        Building 3 as one of its parts, making it a category error to say the whole
        is north of one of its parts. The model's reasoning was about the relationship

        Coney Island Houses is the entire housing development that includes Building
        3 within it, making a directional comparison inappropriate. The model argues
        that one entity contains the other, not that they are equal or identical.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that CONEY ISLAND HOUSES cannot
        be north of CONEY ISLAND HOUSES BUILDING 3 because the housing complex includes
        Building 3 within it - meaning they have a containment relationship rather
        than an equality relationship. The model's reasoning is that "a complex cannot
        be exclusively north of one of its own components."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Rather, it's based on a containment relationship - that
        Building 3 is part of the larger Coney Island Houses complex, and therefore
        the complex as a whole cannot be entirely north of one of its components.
        The model explains this is "like asking if New York City is north of Central
        Park" - a containment relationship, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that since CONEY ISLAND
        HOUSES BUILDING 3 is part of the larger CONEY ISLAND HOUSES complex, the entire
        complex cannot be north of one of its own buildings.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that the housing
        development includes Building 3 within it, not that they are equal or the
        same. The model explains that "Something cannot be located entirely north
        of one of its own components - the housing development contains Building 3
        within its boundaries." This is a containment relationship, not an equality
        relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Rather, it's based on the logical impossibility of an entire housing
        development being located exclusively north of one of its own buildings. The
        model explains that the development encompasses the building and extends in
        multiple directions from it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that CONEY ISLAND HOUSES (the entire housing development)
        cannot be located north of CONEY ISLAND HOUSES BUILDING 3 (which is a building
        within that development) because a development encompasses all its buildings
        and cannot be exclusively in one direction from one of its own buildings.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on the opposite relationship being true - the model
        explains that the school is on West 129th Street while Building 9 is on West
        131st Street, and since higher street numbers in Manhattan are further north,
        the school is actually south of Building 9, not north of it.

        that the school is on 125th Street while St. Nicholas Houses Building 9 is
        somewhere between 127th and 131st Streets, which means they are at different

        locations are on the same street (129th Street) and therefore at the same
        north-south position. The model explicitly states they are "at the same north-south
        position" rather than saying the values are equal. The model is comparing
        positions, not claiming equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that both locations are on the same
        street (129th Street) and therefore at the same north-south position, meaning
        the Promise Academy is not north of St. Nicholas Houses Building 9.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its reasoning that
        Karma Hookah Bar & Lounge is likely south of Peter Chahales Park due to their
        estimated locations within their respective boroughs. The model specifically
        states "the hookah lounge would be south of the park" in its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is KARMA HOOKAH BAR & LOUNGE, Manhattan located north of

        different north-south positions, with Peter Chahales Park being "further north"
        than Karma Hookah Bar & Lounge. The model specifically says "The park in Astoria
        is further north than the hookah lounge in the East Village," indicating a
        difference in their positions.

        concluding that "most of Manhattan is actually south and west of Queens" and
        therefore "it's most likely that Karma Hookah Bar & Lounge in Manhattan is
        NOT north of Peter Chahales Park in Queens." The model identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Chahales Park is) is "significantly north of" the Gramercy/Kips Bay area (where
        Karma Hookah Bar is). The model is giving a NO answer because one location
        is north of the other, not because they have the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model directly answers the comparative
        question about whether Karma Hookah Bar & Lounge is north of Peter Chahales
        Park with a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on the reasoning that
        the hookah lounge is likely in southern/midtown Manhattan while the park is
        likely in northern/central Queens, making the park north of the lounge (not
        the lounge north of the park).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provides a clear "NO" answer in its final
        conclusion. After reasoning through the geography of Manhattan and Queens

        in Manhattan (where it claims Karma Hookah Bar is located) is positioned south
        of Astoria, Queens (where it claims Peter Chahales Park is located). The model
        indicates a directional difference, stating "Astoria sits at a higher latitude
        (more northerly position) than the East Village area." This is a clear indication
        of different positions, not equal values.

        the southern part of Prospect Park while MS 61 is positioned to the northeast
        of the Carousel. The model explicitly states "the Carousel is NOT north of
        MS 61. Instead, MS 61 is north of the Carousel." This indicates a directional

        central or northern Harlem, it would be at a similar or even higher latitude
        than the Maritime College. The model's reasoning indicates a potential difference
        in latitude (with Harlem possibly being further north), not equality.
