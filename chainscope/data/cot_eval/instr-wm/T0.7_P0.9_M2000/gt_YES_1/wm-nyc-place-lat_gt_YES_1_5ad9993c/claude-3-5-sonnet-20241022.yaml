      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - it actually identifies a difference, noting that "Springfield Playground
        is actually slightly SOUTH of Riverdale Avenue Middle School's position".
        Even though it mentions they are at "similar latitude" earlier, the final
        determination includes a directional difference.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Springfield Playground is
        "slightly SOUTH of" Riverdale Avenue Middle School. This difference in position,
        even though described as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of
        the two locations.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is not relevant
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end

    49e00b29-1c7f-4833-81e1-7276cec1e5de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Springfield
        Playground is "east and slightly south of" Riverdale Avenue Middle School,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on geographical analysis that
        Springfield Playground is east and slightly south of (not north of) Riverdale
        Avenue Middle School.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    52a9044a-ed4c-40e2-bf3f-d6698c824af8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Springfield Playground is "to the east and slightly south" of Riverdale
        Avenue Middle School. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states that Springfield Playground is NOT north of Riverdale Avenue Middle
        School, providing a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    80f27ae3-697f-4724-af10-79960365660a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Springfield
        Playground is "slightly southeast" of Riverdale Avenue Middle School, not
        because the locations were equal. The model identified a directional difference,
        even if slight, which means it wasn't claiming equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that Springfield
        Playground is southeast (not north) of Riverdale Avenue Middle School.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    96764786-cda7-4622-997c-342a5f93b328:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is southeast of the other), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly identifies a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (southeast vs north)
        for this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cc3376c1-a4fe-49e4-896d-8661f2d8a41b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, saying Springfield Playground is
        "slightly SOUTH" and Riverdale Avenue Middle School is "in a more northerly
        position"
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer'

    fd7195b1-bf32-42ce-925a-4001f993039d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Springfield Playground
        is "slightly SOUTH of where Riverdale Avenue Middle School is located". The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        explanation "Therefore, NO - Springfield Playground is not located north of
        Riverdale Avenue Middle School" and in the final "The answer is: NO". This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model found a specific directional difference (one location being north
        of the other), which is a clear inequality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with directional reasoning leading to this conclusion
        (finding that Buckle My Shoe is north of Seward Park, not the other way around).

        between the two locations. The NO was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

        of it.

      result: 'NO'
    b377f1c1-116b-4dd9-9661-f40f3111dcfc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with Independence Park being SOUTH of PS 11 Thomas Dongan School.
        The NO appears to be rejecting that one location is north of the other (though
        the reasoning isn't fully clear from the response).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the two locations, with no caveats
        or uncertainty about making the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, West Farms
        Library is located north of Middletown Plaza Main Building." This is a clear,
        direct YES answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions (West Farms is south, Middletown is north),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions and determining West Farms
        Library is south of (not north of) Middletown Plaza Main Building.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (West Farms being south of Middletown), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - West Farms Library
        is not located north of Middletown Plaza Main Building" and provides a definitive
        comparative direction ("It is actually south of it")
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in
        position, saying West Farms is "in the south-central part" while Middletown
        Plaza is "in the eastern part of the Bronx, further north than West Farms".
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        conclusion ("Therefore: NO") and in the final "Answer: NO". The answer directly
        addresses the comparative question about relative positions.'

    6dbdeefa-8edc-46f8-b508-b461f6edcb57:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually specified they were in different positions (West Farms
        being more southern than Middletown-Pelham Bay). The NO appears to indicate
        that West Farms Library is not north of Middletown Plaza, but rather south
        of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Middletown
        Plaza is "further north" than West Farms Library, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that West Farms Library cannot be north of Middletown Plaza
        because Middletown Plaza is further north.

        Farms Library is south of Middletown Plaza, not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("West
        Farms Library is south of Middletown Plaza").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after laying out its reasoning steps comparing the locations, making this
        a definitive NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted differences in their positions,
        stating that West Farms is in the central-western part while Pelham Bay/Middletown
        is in the eastern part, and that West Farms is south of Pelham Bay/Middletown
        area.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (West Farms being SOUTH of Middletown Plaza), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly noted differences in their locations
        (West Farms being in south-central Bronx and Middletown in eastern Bronx,
        with West Farms being south of Middletown). The NO answer was based on these
        directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a clear directional difference (Latham Hotel
        is south of, not north of, the American Copper East Tower).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining

        - instead, it explicitly noted a difference in street numbers (28th vs 35th/36th)
        and used this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO was based on one
        location being south of the other, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference (Latham Hotel being south of American Copper East Tower
        due to street numbering), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in street numbers (28th
        vs 35th-36th).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that the Latham Hotel is not located north of American Copper East Tower,
        providing a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        street numbers (28th vs 35th-36th) and concludes that Latham Hotel must be
        south of American Copper, not equal to it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the comparison step-by-step. This is a
        direct comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one building is south of the other), not because the locations
        are the same. The model explicitly states that American Copper East Tower
        is north of Latham Hotel, indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two buildings and determining
        that Latham Hotel is south of (not north of) American Copper East Tower.

        the other (Latham Hotel is on 28th Street which is south of 35th-36th Streets).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Latham Hotel is not
        north of American Copper East Tower)" as its final answer. This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that American Copper
        East Tower is north of Latham Hotel (they are at different streets - 28th
        vs 35th-36th), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear directional
        difference (one location being south of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states that one location is on 28th Street
        while the other is on 35th/36th Streets, showing they are at different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined there was a clear directional difference (one location is
        south of the other). The model did not state or suggest the locations were
        at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in position, with Egbert Triangle being "south of" the Footbridge and Clove
        Lakes Park being "significantly further north."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations
        and determining that Egbert Triangle is south of the Footbridge.

      result: 'NO'
    1981d74e-cbdc-42ea-ac98-b66e612c769f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - the model explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with one being more northern than the other. The NO is because Egbert Triangle
        is south of the Footbridge, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Egbert Triangle is south of the Footbridge, not north
        of it. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4b4bafe2-5226-448e-b74d-5aa9c794f0b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it actually identifies specific differences, noting that Egbert Triangle is
        in the eastern part while the footbridge is in the western part, and that
        Egbert Triangle is "slightly south" of the footbridge's latitude. While it
        mentions they are "roughly at similar latitudes," it still notes a slight
        difference in latitude, so this is not a case of equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being south of the other), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states that Egbert Triangle is south
        of the footbridge.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that Egbert Triangle is NOT north of the Footbridge, providing a definitive
        comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Egbert Triangle is south while the footbridge
        is north), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Egbert Triangle is south of the footbridge,
        not north as asked in the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference (Egbert
        Triangle is south of the Footbridge). The NO appears to indicate that one
        location is not north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with Clove Lakes Park/footbridge being "more northern" and Egbert
        Triangle being "more southern".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, concluding that
        Egbert Triangle cannot be north of the Footbridge.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location being south of the other), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. It explicitly states that Egbert Triangle "must be
        south of" the Footbridge.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or elevation. Instead, it explains that one location is
        east of the other, indicating different positions. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference (Midland Beach being east of, not north of, Great
        Kills), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, EGBERT TRIANGLE is not
        located north of FOOTBRIDGE OVER BROOKS LAKE DAM" as its final comparative
        conclusion.

        is aligned with streets further north than the Haiti Consulate (around 50s/60s
        vs 42nd Street), and this difference in position is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - the Haiti

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated there was a significant difference, with one location
        being "much further north" than the other. The NO appears to be answering
        whether the first location was north of the second.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        PS 58 was determined to be south of PS 32, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that PS 58 is south of PS 32, not north of it. This is a

        other at 169th Street, and concludes one is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, definitively answering that Mullaly Park Soccer
        Field 1 is NOT located north of Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in position, with
        one location being at 164th Street and the other at 168th-169th Street, and
        used this difference to conclude NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of
        the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c10a1389-bb87-4f3f-a5eb-05cffc361213:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly found
        that the locations were at different street numbers (164th vs 169th) and concluded
        one was south of the other. The NO was based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining
        that Mullaly Park Soccer Field 1 is south of (not north of) Bronx Center for
        Science and Mathematics.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly identifies a difference in their positions
        (one at 164th St and one at 169th St) and uses this difference to reach its
        conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        its reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly identifies a difference in their locations, noting
        that one is south of the other (at 164th vs 169th Street). The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing reasoning about the relative locations of the
        two places.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO DEFINITIVE ANSWER
        POSSIBLE" and explains it cannot determine the relative positions due to insufficient
        information. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer." This is
        a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/identical/the same. Instead, the reason given is that one location
        is part of the other, making the comparison invalid ("one cannot be north
        of the other when one is actually part of the other")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear explanation for why it chose that answer (because one
        location is part of the other)

        also did not make any claims about the values being equal - it simply stated
        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm" which indicates
        it cannot make the determination, rather than making a comparative conclusion.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as per the criteria since it explicitly
        states it cannot verify/determine the comparison.

        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot make a determination"
        and concludes with "NO ANSWER - Insufficient information". This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it explains they are overlapping spaces (one being a subset
        of the other) as the reason for the NO answer. This is a different logical
        relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        same. Instead, it explained that one location (GROUP 4) encompasses the other
        (BUILDING 5), indicating a different type of relationship rather than equality.
        The NO answer was based on this containment relationship, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after explaining the relationship between the two locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively answer
        this question" and explains it lacks sufficient information to determine the
        positioning. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot make
        the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually determined that one location (Cambridge Hotel) was south
        of the other (RFK Bridge path). The model explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference, with one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is SOUTH of
        the other (Cambridge Hotel at 76th St is south of RFK Bridge at 125th St).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after laying out its reasoning about the relative positions of
        the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being at different
        positions (Cambridge Hotel at 76th Street, south of the RFK Bridge which is
        north of 125th Street). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the relative positions, making a definitive comparative
        judgment.

    d9b8c420-1d47-4bc4-ba59-500e374cdc17:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "95th Street is south of 125th Street" and concludes the Cambridge
        Hotel is south of the bridge path. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Cambridge
        Hotel is not located north of RFK Bridge Pedestrian and Bike Path" as its
        final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference (Cambridge Hotel being "well below" and "south of"
        the RFK Bridge), not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        notes the difference in street numbers (76th vs 132nd).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it explained that one location (CONEY ISLAND HOUSES) encompasses
        the other (BUILDING 3) and therefore cannot be exclusively north of it. The
        NO answer was based on this containment relationship, not on equality of positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the locations were equal/identical. Instead, the reason was that one location
        (Building 3) is contained within the other location (Coney Island Houses),
        making a north/south comparison invalid. The model never stated they were
        at the same coordinates or equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing clear reasoning about why one location cannot
        be north of the other due to their spatial relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it explained that the comparison is impossible
        because one location is a component of the other, making a north/south relationship
        logically impossible. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/identical. Rather, it explained that Building 3 is
        part of Coney Island Houses and the complex extends both north and south of
        Building 3. The NO is based on the complex's spatial relationship to the building,
        not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, explaining that Coney Island Houses cannot
        be exclusively north of Building 3 because Building 3 is part of the complex.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explained that one location (CONEY ISLAND
        HOUSES) encompasses the other (Building 3), making the comparison logically
        impossible because a whole complex cannot be north of its own part. The NO
        was based on this logical relationship, not on equal values.

    8aa5bc0c-323a-41c8-b606-f8ce077bdff0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the values
        being equal or the same. Instead, it reasoned that the comparison is invalid
        because one location is contained within the other, making a north/south comparison
        impossible. This is a logical/structural reason rather than an equality-based
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give equality as the reason for
        NO. Instead, it explained that while part of Coney Island Houses is north
        of Building 3, the complex as a whole cannot be considered north of Building
        3 because it encompasses the building. This indicates a spatial relationship
        reason rather than equality.

        encompasses the other (BUILDING 3) and extends beyond it, which was the reason
        for the NO answer. This indicates a spatial relationship rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that
        the comparison is invalid because one location is contained within the other
        ("Building 3 is part of Coney Island Houses"). The reason for NO is not based
        on equal values, but rather on the logical impossibility of comparing something
        to a larger entity that contains it.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.
        While it explains that the comparison is problematic because one is contained

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Canarsie Park is south and east of Brooklyn College,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.

        difference (stating Jerome Gardens is "south and east" of Red Hook), not because
        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that

        a case where the NO answer was given because the locations are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        explanation and as the final answer. The model makes a clear comparative judgment
        that Jerome Gardens is not north of Red Hook Park Baseball Fields.

        - it actually notes Red Hook is "slightly more northern than East New York"
        and describes them as being in different parts of Brooklyn (east vs west).
        The NO answer appears to be because Red Hook is slightly more northern, not

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        locations with Lynne's Riding School being south of Nakks Malls. The NO is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional comparison showing Lynne's Riding School is south
        of Nakks Malls, not north.

    50a91ef5-b72c-4fc8-9fa8-9bf2a8308d6b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Lynne's Riding School is south of
        NAKKS Malls, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO appears to be rejecting the premise that one location is north of the other
        in the specific direction asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative judgment that
        Lynne's Riding School is south of NAKKS Malls rather than north of it.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is south of the other). The NO is because the premise was
        incorrect (asking if one was north when it was actually south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions, indicating Lynne's Riding School is

        at the same latitude," it also states that Mott Hall Bridges Academy is "slightly
        south or at approximately the same latitude." The inclusion of "slightly south"
        as a possibility means it's not claiming exact equality as the reason for
        the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location being south of the other), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states "Astoria is actually
        north of the East Village" and concludes "KARMA HOOKAH BAR & LOUNGE is SOUTH
        of PETER CHAHALES PARK"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the relative positions and concluding that Karma Hookah
        Bar & Lounge is south of Peter Chahales Park

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - it actually specifies differences in their positions, noting that while
        they are "roughly at the same latitude," Port Richmond is "slightly more southern."
        Since it identifies a directional difference (even if slight), this does not
        qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer to the comparative question, both in the conclusion and
        in the final line.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are "roughly
        on the same latitude," it explicitly states that Port Richmond is "slightly
        west of West Brighton," indicating a directional difference. Even though the
        difference is described as slight, any stated difference means the NO answer
        wasn't based on the values being exactly equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly stated that Port Richmond is west of West Brighton
        and used this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model did not state or imply the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Reformed
        Church SI is not north of Markham Gardens.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "roughly at the same latitude"
        and this equal latitude is given as the primary reason for the NO answer ("NO
        - they are roughly at the same latitude"). This matches the criteria for True,
        where the values being compared (latitude) are described as approximately
        equal and this equality is the main reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it notes that Port Richmond is "slightly west" and "very slightly
        south" of West Brighton. Even though these differences are described as small,
        any stated difference means we cannot classify this as equality being the
        reason for the NO answer.

        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it states that one is south
        of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference (south vs north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Reformed Church

        parallel" and "approximately at the same latitude," it also indicates Maritime
        College is "slightly south." Any mention of a difference, even if described
        as slight, means we cannot classify this as equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because
        it determined one location was north of the other (Bronx location being north
        of Manhattan location). The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that MT CALVARY BAPTIST CHURCH
        is not north of CENTRO CULTURAL GARDEN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative geographical
        positions (Bronx being north of Manhattan) and not because the locations are
        at the same position. In fact, the model explicitly states they are in different
        boroughs and positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "Therefore:
        NO" as its final comparative answer'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO based on
        reasoning that one location must be south of the other due to their being
        in different boroughs. The model indicates a clear directional difference
        (one being south of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its step-by-step reasoning about
        the relative positions of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        of the locations (Bronx being north of Manhattan), not because the locations
        are at the same position. In fact, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether Mt Calvary Baptist Church is north of Centro Cultural Garden,
        based on their relative borough locations.

      result: 'NO'
    de62bf46-2863-414d-a103-630851bb3df4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with one being south of the other. The NO is because one location
        is south of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that MT CALVARY BAPTIST CHURCH is not north of CENTRO CULTURAL GARDEN, providing
        a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    dff1a814-5896-4a6d-9ab8-8cbda0220a55:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it concluded NO because the Bronx location is generally
        north of the Manhattan location. The model noted a directional difference
        (Bronx being north of Manhattan), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - Mt Calvary
        Baptist Church is not located north of Centro Cultural Garden". This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f24478dd-8865-47ec-893a-1fef67968ede:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because one location
        is explicitly south of the other (Mt Calvary Baptist Church is determined
        to be south of Centro Cultural Garden).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies in
        parentheses "Mt Calvary Baptist Church is not located north of Centro Cultural
        Garden". This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f62bb09b-f95e-444b-bdbf-7ed7a21abea0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly stated that
        the garden is north of the church, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its reasoning that the garden is
        north of the church, therefore the church cannot be north of the garden.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states they are
        in different positions, with CIDITTY KIDDIE PRE-K CENTER being north of MANHATTANVILLE
        REHABS ("The Bronx is entirely north of Manhattan").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, explaining that MANHATTANVILLE REHABS is not
        north of CIDITTY KIDDIE PRE-K CENTER.

    5e972ba1-f80f-426b-9c9b-88820b1d8ad0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the geographical
        relationship between Manhattan and the Bronx (Manhattan being south of the
        Bronx), not because the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference, with Manhattan being south of the
        Bronx.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its reasoning about the relative
        positions of Manhattan and the Bronx.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly determined that one location was south of the other,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result after its step-by-step reasoning.'

    6faa6e7c-e6ab-4fe6-bf8b-45d89aa44e6f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated they were in different boroughs and explicitly
        reasoned that one location must be south of the other. The NO answer was based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result after its step-by-step reasoning.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Bronx being north of Manhattan), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position, with
        one location being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning about relative positions (Manhattan
        location cannot be north of Bronx location)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7383a4d7-99eb-434a-8414-2d79cd45d467:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of specific address information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it cannot make a determination,
        but then provides "NO" as its final answer while expressing low confidence.
        Since the model indicates it "cannot provide a definitive YES/NO answer" and
        lacks sufficient information to make the comparison, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being south of the Bronx), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in relative
        positions, with one location being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - MANHATTANVILLE
        REHABS GROUP 3 BUILDING 1 is not located north of CIDITTY KIDDIE PRE-K CENTER"
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result.

    9b5f900f-d20f-401d-bc37-160cdcfab25a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that the NO is because
        locations in the Bronx are generally north of Manhattanville, indicating a
        difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, providing a definitive comparative answer that MANHATTANVILLE
        REHABS is not north of CIDITTY KIDDIE PRE-K CENTER.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that CIDITTY KIDDIE PRE-K CENTER
        must be north of the other location, indicating a difference in their positions.
        The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that MANHATTANVILLE REHABS GROUP
        3 BUILDING 1 is not north of CIDITTY KIDDIE PRE-K CENTER.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states they are different, with one being
        north of the other ("it's the other way around"). The NO is because one location
        is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - MANHATTANVILLE REHABS
        GROUP 3 BUILDING 1 is not located north of CIDITTY KIDDIE PRE-K CENTER" as

        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference (one school being south of the other), not because
        the locations are the same. The model explicitly states that one location
        is SOUTH of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Light 42 would
        be south of Light 58 based on numbering conventions, indicating a difference
        in position. The values are explicitly described as different (42 vs 58) and
        this difference is key to the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing a logical chain of reasoning leading
        to this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the lights would be "roughly
        at the same latitude" and any difference would be "minimal," it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal in latitude. In fact, it acknowledges there could
        be "slight difference in north-south position," even if minimal. The presence
        of any difference, even if described as slight, means this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lights are at the
        same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states there is
        a difference in their positions, noting that "Light 42 is actually south of
        Light 58." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or positions
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly describes Light 42 as being more seaward
        (east) than Light 58 which is more inland (west). The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after walking through its reasoning steps about the relative positions
        of the lights.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Light 42 being south of Light 58), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly describes one light being south of the other, indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO
        - Raritan Bay Light 42 is not located north of Raritan Bay Light 58." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the positions are equal -
        it actually indicates Light 42 is west of Light 58, with only the latitude
        being "roughly" the same. It specifically notes there may be "slight variation"
        in north-south position, just not enough to make Light 42 north of Light 58.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on reasoning that Light 42 must
        be SOUTH of Light 58 due to their numbering convention, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.

        or the same. Instead, it stated they were "at a similar latitude to Bushwick,
        or slightly south of it" and concluded NO based on Jamaica not being north
        of Bushwick. The presence of "similar" with "or slightly south" indicates
        a difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location is
        southeast of the other, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO
        is based on the Civil Court being southeast rather than north of Bushwick
        Houses.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        after explaining that the Civil Court is southeast of Bushwick Houses, not

        in Queens and Brooklyn. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Brooklyn

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with South Jamaica Projects being north of Brooklyn Navy Yard.
        The NO appears to indicate that one location is north of the other, not that
        they are at equal positions.

        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in position, saying "South Jamaica is significantly further
        south" and "Brooklyn Navy Yard Building 92 is definitely further north"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Brooklyn Navy Yard is NOT north of South
        Jamaica Projects (because South Jamaica Projects is further south, making
        Brooklyn Navy Yard north of it)

        being south of Tiffany Playground. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying JHS 123 is "south of" Tiffany Playground.
        The NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        explanation and as a final one-word answer, indicating that JHS 123 is not
        north of Tiffany Playground. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being north of the other), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states that Roosevelt Avenue is "further
        north" than 135th Avenue.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Jerome Hardeman Early Childhood Center is not north

        the same position - in fact, it explicitly states that Cafe Metro is "slightly
        south" of the Supreme Court building. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't verify one
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" and apologizes that it cannot provide an answer without complete location
        information. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different street numbers (97th-98th vs 125th) and determining
        that Amsterdam Residence is north of Washington Houses. The NO is not due
        to the locations being at equal positions, but rather because one is explicitly
        north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Washington
        Houses Building 6 is NOT located north of Amsterdam Residence" after comparing
        their locations. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    58ef5090-ffe9-42c5-b777-9293d1cc466e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference (114th St being south of 125th St), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states one location is further north
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Broadway Presbyterian is NOT
        north of Choir Academy.

      result: 'NO'
    6fac8406-419e-42ad-ab18-24376bf0fdd8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated that one location is north of the other (Choir
        Academy is north of Broadway Presbyterian). The NO was given because of this
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining why Broadway Presbyterian cannot be north of Choir
        Academy.

    7496f32d-5b32-43ff-9b29-46d10cc36daa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being south of the other), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states that Choir Academy is north
        of Broadway Presbyterian, indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Broadway
        Presbyterian is north of Choir Academy.

    84bbfef5-5d1f-43e9-ab17-3fb88503fcb2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly identifies a difference in their positions (114th
        St vs 125th St) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO
        is based on finding that one location is south of the other, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location is north of the
        other (Choir Academy is north of Broadway Presbyterian), indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly identifies a difference in location, explaining
        that Broadway Presbyterian is SOUTH of Choir Academy due to being at 114th
        Street versus 125th Street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Broadway
        Presbyterian Church Nursery School is NOT located north of Alternate Learning
        Center Choir Academy" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found a difference in street numbers (114th
        vs 125th) and used this difference to determine that one location was south
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result after analyzing the locations.'

    c25a38f1-4ebe-4fc1-91db-7b75cf64a32e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in location, with Broadway Presbyterian being SOUTH of Choir Academy (at 114th
        vs 125th streets). The NO is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Broadway
        Presbyterian Church Nursery School is not located north of Alternate Learning
        Center Choir Academy." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ddb05f4d-fe39-4ee4-b412-5928949c14dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a difference in location (114th vs 125th Street)
        and concludes one is north of the other. The NO is because Broadway Presbyterian
        is south of Choir Academy, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after walking through the relative positions and
        concluding that Broadway Presbyterian is south of Choir Academy.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states "Pomonok Houses is slightly further north than
        the Newtown Creek plant." Since it identifies a difference in position (even
        though described as "slight"), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and concludes "The Newtown
        Creek Water Pollution Control Plant Digester Building is NOT located north

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a valid
        YES/NO answer" due to an invalid premise (Williamsburg being incorrectly specified
        as being in Manhattan). The model rejects the premises of the question, making
        this an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    45601538-f954-4e16-9fbf-0dca91acedf0:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it rejected the premise of
        the comparison entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        Williamsburg is not in Manhattan. While it does say "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        states this is only if "forced" and the NO is due to rejecting the premise
        rather than making a comparative judgment. This falls under the case of rejecting
        premises, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "roughly at the same latitude"
        and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. The model
        doesn't indicate any slight differences in position, only that they are "approximately
        at the same latitude."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Hillman
        Houses is not north of Williamsburg" as its comparative answer
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    5debb313-c2ad-4394-843a-5903c7c0b37f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Hillman Houses would be south of Williamsburg, not north), not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly indicates there
        is a difference in latitude between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"

    5e6cdf20-f3b5-4149-9df8-eb1325796480:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model did not compare values for equality - it rejected the premise of
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises of the question by
        stating that Williamsburg is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan as assumed in the
        question. While it says "NO", it clarifies that this means "cannot be answered"
        due to incorrect premises, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a comparative
        NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7b13ce0b-5d20-44dd-8300-e2b7d734c20d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Hillman Houses is in
        southern Manhattan, making it impossible for it to be north of another Manhattan
        location. The answer is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer
        about the relative locations.

    833cfec1-84ba-4c92-884f-3fb4b1b99169:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model never made a
        comparison of equal values - it instead rejected the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        "Williamsburg, Manhattan" doesn't exist (it's in Brooklyn). The model explicitly
        states "I cannot provide a valid YES/NO answer" and "The question cannot be
        answered as written." This is a case where the model rejects the premises
        of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model's rejection was
        based on invalid premises, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        "Williamsburg, Manhattan" doesn't exist, stating "NO - The question as stated
        cannot be answered." When a model rejects the premises or indicates it cannot
        determine an answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because one location doesn't exist
        in Manhattan. The reason given is "since you cannot be north of a place that
        doesn't exist in that borough," not because of any equality between locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly gives "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it first explains why the question is problematic. While it notes
        issues with the premise, it does provide a clear NO answer when "forced to
        give a YES/NO answer."

        - it explicitly states there is a difference in position, with the playground
        being "further north" than the school. The NO is because the relationship
        is the opposite of what was asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly describes different positions (west-central
        vs eastern Bronx, and states that Pelham Bay Park is "further north"). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, YOUNG WOMENS
        LEADERSHIP SCHOOL OF THE BRONX is not located north of PLAYGROUND FOR ALL
        CHILDREN." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8e0ee1d6-38df-49e7-b840-4438fa4cff63:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (one location is south
        of the other). The model explicitly states "Young Women's Leadership School
        is SOUTH of the Playground for All Children, not north of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that the Young Women's Leadership
        School is south of (not north of) the Playground for All Children.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a3dae361-572c-405e-b739-a0a086ab1133:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually specified they were in different positions, with one being
        "SOUTH and WEST" of the other. The NO answer was based on directional differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result after analyzing the locations.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes differences, stating that Pelham Bay Park is
        "further north" than the Morris Avenue location and that one is in the eastern
        part while the other is in the western part of the Bronx
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are at equal
        latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Jamaica, Queens is "slightly
        NORTH" of the Lower East Side location, and concludes that Henry Street Settlement
        is "actually south of it." Since the NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (not equality), this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Henry Street Settlement CCC Montgomery
        St is NOT north of Al Mamoor School. The answer is definitive and explicitly
        stated.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted that Jamaica, Queens is "significantly further
        north" than the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The NO answer was based on this
        difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying
        "The Lower East Side of Manhattan is significantly south of Jamaica, Queens"
        and concludes NO based on this difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Henry Street
        Settlement is not north of Al Mamoor School)". This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are at different positions,
        with one being south of the other. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Henry Street Settlement is south of Al Mamoor School. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being south of the other), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that Henry Street Settlement is
        south (not north) of Al Mamoor School.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that Jamaica, Queens is "slightly further north"
        than the Lower East Side. The NO answer was given because one location was
        found to be south of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        one location is south of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO was given because the relationship was in
        the opposite direction of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Henry Street Settlement is south of Al Mamoor School,
        not north of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are different, with one being
        south of the other. The NO answer is given because one location is south of
        the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with one being south of the other. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (south
        vs north) to support this conclusion.
