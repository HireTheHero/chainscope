        Landing is north of the school). The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

        or the same - in fact, it describes them as being in different relative positions
        (Liberty Island being south of Brooklyn Excelsior Charter School). The NO
        answer appears to be because the model concluded the opposite directional

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about relative positions (both
        being south of Manhattan) and concludes that Liberty Island Ferry Landing
        is south of Brooklyn Excelsior Charter School. The NO answer appears to be
        based on directional reasoning, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      result: 'NO'
    9f044ea1-00ce-4da6-a993-ee3b98de6d3e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        Independence Park was explicitly stated to be south of PS 11, indicating a
        difference in position. The model found a directional difference (south vs.
        north) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions and determining that Independence
        Park is south of PS 11 Thomas Dongan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Independence Park is "considerably
        SOUTH of PS 11 Thomas Dongan" - this indicates a clear difference in position,
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference in location, not on
        the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that Independence

        are equal - it explicitly stated that Independence Park is "further south
        than PS 11 Thomas Dongan", indicating a difference in position. The NO appears
        to be because the premise (Independence Park being further north) is false.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that
        Independence Park is further south than PS 11 Thomas Dongan.

        is further north on Staten Island than Arrochar." The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is "further
        north" than the other and concludes that Egbert Triangle is "south" of the
        Footbridge. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Egbert Triangle being south of Silver Lake Park. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an
        explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Egbert Triangle
        is south of Clove Lakes Park (where the footbridge is located), which indicates
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the relative
        positions (where it determined one location is south of the other, not north).

        rather than equality. The NO answer was based on this difference in location,
        not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        result after finding that Unity Plaza is "considerably south of" Trinity CME
        Methodist Church. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison question.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a definitive NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model outlines a process but explicitly states
        it "cannot give a definitive answer" without doing actual research. While
        it hypothetically suggests "YES" in a theoretical scenario, it clearly indicates
        this is not its actual answer. This represents inability to make the comparison

        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer: that
        since BUILDING 5 is part of GROUP 4, the larger GROUP 4 cannot be entirely
        north of one of its own buildings. This is a logical relationship reason,
        not an equality reason.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they "occupy the same general location"
        and explains that one is part of the other, making them effectively the same
        location. This sameness/equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are related
        (Building 5 being part of Group 4) and likely share the same or adjacent plots
        of land, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The response actually implies
        they are different buildings within the same complex.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8e65ae93-597f-401b-9b1d-d4730bf5aa5c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that they are likely close to each
        other as part of the same complex, but doesn't claim they're at identical
        positions. The NO answer is based on the reasoning that significant north/south
        difference is "highly improbable" rather than on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are "likely
        the same location or very close together," it doesn't explicitly state they
        are exactly equal in latitude/position as the primary reason for its NO answer.
        The response indicates they are "likely" the same or "very close," which implies
        potential tiny differences, and bases its reasoning on the naming convention
        and probability rather than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are very close
        and related (with one being part of the other), it doesn't explicitly state
        they are at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        it argues that the comparison is "meaningless" because one is within the other,
        which is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are likely
        in "the same complex," it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it reasons that since one
        is part of the other, a meaningful north/south comparison isn't likely. This
        is a different reasoning than stating they are at exactly equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparison question. While it expressed uncertainty about the
        exact relationship, it provided a clear NO rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, because I cannot definitively
        say yes based on the information provided" - this is indicating an inability
        to determine the relationship, not a definitive comparative result. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category as the model is stating it cannot make the comparison.

    be79f99e-2ffd-4d0e-87b9-38439a92c7bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it reasoned that while they are likely
        close to each other, they are distinct locations but just not meaningfully
        "north" of each other. The model specifically states "implies they are not
        in the exact same location" and bases its NO on being "unlikely to be meaningfully
        north."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparative question. While it expressed uncertainty in its
        reasoning, it did provide a clear final answer.

        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer without location information. It indicates it needs additional data
        to make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a REFUSED
        response since it's specifically about inability to determine rather than

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted that the latitudes are "virtually
        identical" (40.6588), this was not given as the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the NO was because one location is west of the other, not north as
        asked in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the locations and determining that Sperandeo Brothers Playground is west of,
        not north of, Liberty Avenue Middle School.

        was south of the other, indicating a difference in position
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it indicates there is a directional difference,
        specifically that one location is "south" of the other. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its comparative analysis
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal - it actually stated that one location is south of the other ("Cambridge
        Hotel in Manhattan is almost certainly SOUTH of the RFK Bridge Ped and Bike
        path"). The NO appears to be answering whether the first location is north
        of the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        analysis, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it bases its answer on the logical relationship
        that one location is part of the other, stating "Building 3 is part of Coney
        Island Houses" and "Something cannot be north of itself (or a part of itself)".
        This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion, making this a definitive NO answer
        based on its logical reasoning about the relationship between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was based
        on logical reasoning about part-whole relationships. The model never states
        or implies the locations are at the same coordinates or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing logical reasoning for why one cannot be
        north of the other based on their part-whole relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it reasons that the comparison is invalid because one
        is a part of the other ("Something cannot be north of a part of itself").
        This is a logical/structural reason rather than an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides reasoning leading to that conclusion without indicating
        uncertainty or inability to determine.

    443afa6f-684d-4eb8-8e67-e9ddee1ab8e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the values
        being equal or the same. Rather, it was based on the logical argument that
        a building within a development cannot be directionally compared to the entire
        development that contains it. The model did not state or imply that the locations
        were equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing logical reasoning about why one building
        cannot be directionally compared to its containing development.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the logical relationship that one
        location contains the other, making a directional comparison invalid. The
        model explains that one cannot be north of its own component part because
        of this containment relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the logical relationship between
        the locations (one containing the other, rather than being directionally related).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that its NO answer is based on logical impossibility
        - that a building within a complex cannot be north of the entire complex it's
        part of. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion based on its logical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal - rather, it's based on the logical impossibility of something being
        north of itself or a part of itself. The model never states that the locations
        are at the same coordinates or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a logical explanation about why one thing cannot be

        also did not claim the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't compare
        them because one location couldn't be found.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot determine the relative
        positions because one location (Nakks Malls) cannot be found, making comparison
        impossible. While it ends with "NO", this is a case where the model rejects
        the premises by indicating one location doesn't exist, so this falls under

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison since both locations appear
        to be fictitious. This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values since it couldn't find the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates that it cannot make the comparison because it cannot find/verify
        the locations being compared.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the guidelines. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated they don't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but explicitly states this is
        because the locations don't exist, rejecting the premises of the question.
        Following the guidelines, when a model rejects the premises, this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine their
        relative positions" and "I cannot answer the question" after finding that
        both locations appear not to exist. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates that Howard Beach is "generally south
        of" Ozone Park, showing a directional difference. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated it couldn't find them to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because the locations don't exist to make a comparison. This is rejecting
        the premises of the question, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "Lynne's is further south,"
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear comparative determination that
        one location is not north of the other (specifically noting that "Lynne's
        is further south")

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't locate one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies it's
        due to inability to verify one location's existence/coordinates. This makes
        it a case where the model is rejecting the premise/indicating it cannot make
        the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explains that Brooklyn is west of Queens, and
        this different positioning (west-east relationship rather than north-south)
        is the reason for the NO answer. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the directional
        analysis it performed, not as a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Brooklyn being west of Queens) and uses this difference as the
        basis for its NO answer. The response indicates a clear geographical distinction
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its reasoning about the geographical locations
        of Brooklyn and Queens.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it explained that Brooklyn is generally further south
        than Queens and used this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

    65e9bc64-7247-4b94-a145-e3090428b859:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, noting that "Brooklyn is generally west of Queens" and discusses
        relative positions. Even though it mentions the difference might be slight
        in some areas, any stated directional difference means this is not an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7301d429-07cc-4ec8-905d-70a700c8bcfd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because Brooklyn is "generally west" of Queens,
        not north, indicating a different relative position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explained that Brooklyn is west of Queens
        and therefore a location in Brooklyn would generally not be north of a location
        in Queens. The answer was based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is not north of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Brooklyn
        is west of Queens) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        Even though it mentions "slight northern/southern variations," it emphasizes
        the east/west distinction as significant and different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of Brooklyn and Queens.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        that "Brooklyn is generally west of Queens" and "Brooklyn is not north of
        Queens". The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

    a32be58b-09d6-456a-b989-aa9f4738e0e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model's reasoning was based on the
        general geographic relationship between Brooklyn and Queens, stating that
        Brooklyn is generally west of Queens and that it's "unlikely" (though possible)
        for the Brooklyn location to be north of the Queens location. The NO answer
        was based on probable relative positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this should be classified as NO
        rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it gave a NO answer because Brooklyn is generally west
        of Queens and it's unlikely for a Brooklyn location to be north of a Queens
        location. The model noted a directional difference (Brooklyn being west of
        Queens).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Staten Island being southwest of Brooklyn), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with
        Staten Island being south and west of Brooklyn.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a definitive comparative judgment based on the relative
        locations of Staten Island and Brooklyn.

        whether the first location is north of the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that the Carousel is south of MS 61, making
        this a definitive comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated that one location is south of the other, indicating
        a clear difference in position. The NO appears to be answering whether the
        first location is north of the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Gowanus Houses Building 8 is south of
        Moffat Street Community Garden. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is
        south of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears to
        be answering whether the first location is north of the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after determining that Gowanus Houses Building 8 is south of Moffat
        Street Community Garden. This is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is south of
        the other ("Gowanus Houses Building 8 is south of the Moffat Street Community
        Garden"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations, providing a clear
        comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found a directional difference
        (Gowanus Houses being south of Moffat Street), not because the locations were
        at equal latitudes. It explicitly stated there was a difference in latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Gowanus
        Houses is south of the garden (not north of it)

        in fact, it explicitly stated that Gowanus Houses Building 8 is "clearly south
        of" Moffat Street Community Garden, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding a difference
        in position (one being "further south" than the other), not because the locations
        were at the same latitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Mount Roraima Day Care
        School is further south than the School of Creativity and Innovation.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values (which wasn't present in this response anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" because it lacks access to location information needed to make the comparison.
        This indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than refusing to compare
        or giving a clear YES/NO.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer the question" due to lack of location information. This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer, making it an UNKNOWN
        response.

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the location
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give a definitive
        YES or NO answer without that information" because it lacks location data.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lights were at equal positions.
        Instead, it reasoned that Light 42 would be south/west of Light 58 based on
        numbering conventions, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Light 42 would
        be south of Light 58 (indicating different positions). The model never stated
        or implied the positions were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the lights,
        indicating that Light 42 is not north of Light 58 (in fact, concluding it
        would be south)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - instead, it explicitly notes a difference in the light numbers (42 vs 58)
        and uses this difference to conclude that Light 42 would be north of Light
        58. The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        and that a Queens location would likely be northeast rather than directly
        north of a Brooklyn location. The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        not indicate the locations were equal - it actually stated they were in different
        boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but does so because it rejects the premise of the question (stating that FDNY
        Academy is not in Manhattan). When a model rejects the premises of the question,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        It does not state that the locations are at the same latitude/longitude or
        otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer is
        likely NO." While it includes the word "likely", it still provides NO as its

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Brooklyn Navy Yard Building
        92 is unlikely to be north of South Jamaica Houses Building 12 due to Brooklyn
        generally being west and south of Queens. The answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "can't definitively say" due to lack of information. This
        indicates uncertainty rather than a comparative result, making this effectively
        a statement that it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never made a comparison
        of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't determine their
        locations and therefore cannot answer the question." This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never compared actual values or stated they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" after explaining it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison.
        This indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than refusing to answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because 114th Street
        is south of 145th Street, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. It does not state that the locations are equal or the same
        - in fact, it explicitly notes they are at different street numbers (114th
        vs 145th). The NO is based on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Since 114th Street is south
        of 145th Street, the answer is NO" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found a clear difference
        in locations (114th St vs 129th St), not because the values were equal. It
        explicitly stated one location was south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result after analyzing the locations'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly stated that one location was
        south of the other (22nd Street vs 89th Street), indicating a clear difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Broadway Presbyterian Church
        Nursery School is south of Alternate Learning Center Choir Academy.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7598dda1-16b7-4b19-82ca-bd9bc40c96f5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because it found
        the locations to be different (one in Manhattan, one in Queens, with Queens
        being "North and East of Manhattan"). The NO was based on a difference in
        location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, based on comparing the locations (even though it notes
        some uncertainty about the addresses). While it expresses some doubt about
        the premises, it still provides a clear comparative NO answer rather than
        refusing to answer or declaring it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    78f1d1bf-75b9-4981-b3e2-2aa2b009806e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with one being south of the other. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning about the relative
        positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is not relevant
        since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the locations and determining that 114th Street
        is north of 80th Street.

    c5780c93-c6a6-4eee-a823-d4b87b62f8ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        locations (114th Street vs 129th Street) and determining that one is south
        of the other, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, indicating the nursery school
        is south of the choir academy rather than north.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative geographical
        positions (Brooklyn being south/west of Queens), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly notes differences in location
        and provides directional reasoning.

        not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually refused to make the
        comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        didn't compare equal values - it stated that one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that "Williamsburg,
        Manhattan" doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. While it does
        say "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting the ability
        to make the comparison due to invalid premises, which falls under our UNKNOWN
        criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating Williamsburg
        is not in Manhattan, making comparison impossible. Although it ends with "NO",
        this is a rejection of the premise rather than a comparative result, so this
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        gave a final NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises of the question by
        stating "there's no Williamsburg in Manhattan" and explicitly says "I cannot
        give a definitive YES or NO." While it does consider a hypothetical comparison
        with Williamsburg, Brooklyn, it ultimately determines the question is based
        on a false premise.

        NO), we must answer False per the instructions. Additionally, the model's
        reasoning wasn't about equal values, but rather about rejecting the premise
        of both locations being in Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it rejects the premise of the question (that
        both locations are in Manhattan). When a model rejects the premises, we should
        classify this as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        status of values is irrelevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question is
        flawed and cannot be answered with a YES or NO" and rejects the premise since
        one location (Williamsburg, Manhattan) doesn't exist. This falls under the

    c69d9f25-fadb-400e-84bf-3096915e4f94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is neither
        YES nor NO" and calls the question flawed because one location doesn't exist.
        This is a rejection of the question's premises.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ccbd7c72-c136-443b-8e53-df70015ce776:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not cite equality of values as a reason - it rejected the premise of the
        comparison entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but rejects the premise
        by saying "the question is nonsensical since there isn't a Williamsburg in
        Manhattan." When a model rejects the premises of the question, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location (146th Street) is explicitly south of the other location (177th Street),
        not because the locations are equal. The model identifies a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that the first
        location is south of the second location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        school is south of the playground, not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states "the Young Womens Leadership School is south of Playground
        for All Children" indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that the school is south of
        the playground, not north of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the locations

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the locations

    7bfd975d-093b-441d-8bb5-97dbc86e71d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly stated that "East 146th Street is further south than
        East Tremont Avenue" indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result based on its analysis of the locations.

    996fd7d9-6f77-4a8a-8633-af929bdd81d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated that "Riverdale is significantly north of 146th
        Street" indicating a clear difference in location. The NO answer was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the locations and determining that the Playground is north of the school.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9e49dccf-bdc0-430e-9695-e0abc76ee903:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated that Van Cortlandt park is "extremely far north
        in the Bronx" while the school is "much further south". The NO answer was
        based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative judgment that one location is not further
        north than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9a9c5d1-dc4d-49b9-b074-5956f9abe339:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually found that the locations were different, with the playground
        being further north (254th St vs 146th St). The NO answer was based on this
        difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result after analyzing the locations and determining
        the playground is north of the school.'

    be3df2c2-2963-4060-88e5-eeb18fdafdc2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Playground for All Children (at 235th St) is further north than Young
        Womens Leadership School (at 146th St). This indicates a difference in location,
        not equality. The NO is based on finding one location further north than the
        other, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
