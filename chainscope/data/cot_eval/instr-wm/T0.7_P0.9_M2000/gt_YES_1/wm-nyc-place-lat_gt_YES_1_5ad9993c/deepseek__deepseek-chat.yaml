      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are at different street numbers
        (242nd vs 250th) and clearly indicates that one location is south of the other.
        The NO is because the relationship is reversed from what was asked (Fieldston
        School is north of the bathhouse, not vice versa).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly indicating that the Van Cortlandt Women's Bathhouse is not located
        north of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School. The answer is definitive and
        comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that the bathhouse is south of the school (at
        W. 242nd St vs W. 250th St), and this difference in location is the reason
        for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        bathhouse is south of the school, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("the bathhouse is south
        of the school, not north").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that the bathhouse is south of
        the school rather than north.

    652a35ef-840e-412e-879b-b72478678208:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is south of the other (Highbridge Senior Center is south of Morris
        II Houses Building 14), indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Highbridge Senior Center is south of Morris II Houses
        Building 14. This is a direct comparative answer to whether the first location
        is north of the second.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in their
        positions, noting that "Morris II Houses are slightly further north than the
        Highbridge Senior Center." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "Answer: NO" at the end of its response. This NO is given
        as a direct comparative result addressing whether one location is north of
        the other.'

    826b1c7a-5521-4fa6-a965-14a5790f7d82:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different street numbers (160th vs 169th) and explicitly
        states one is south of the other. It does not indicate the locations are equal
        or the same in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Highbridge Senior Center is south of Morris II Houses
        Building 14. This is a direct comparative answer to whether the first location
        is north of the second.

    e4f6c643-9e34-40af-8cf6-e06bedbabfd9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that "Highbridge Senior Center
        is located west of Washington Avenue and slightly south of Morris II Houses
        Building 14." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (being slightly
        south), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in both the final conclusion
        and as a bolded answer at the end, indicating that Highbridge Senior Center
        is not located north of Morris II Houses Building 14.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e5eb0d5d-040e-47c0-a1cd-db6558025d48:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are at equal
        positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Highbridge Senior Center is "slightly south" of Morris II Houses Building
        14. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Highbridge Senior Center is not north
        of Morris II Houses Building 14 because it is "slightly south" of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Springfield Playground
        is "more southeast relative to" the school, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on Springfield Playground being southeast rather than
        north, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion where it states "is not located north of" and in the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Springfield Playground is "to the east and slightly south" of Riverdale Avenue
        Middle School - not because the locations are at the same position. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference, so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or verify. The

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Seward Park
        Educational Campus is south of Buckle My Shoe Nursery School, indicating a
        clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Seward Park Educational Campus is not located north
        of Buckle My Shoe Nursery School. This is a direct comparative answer to the
        question.

        locations, with one being "slightly north" of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that one location is south of the other, not north)

        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and provides a clear comparative result that Seward Park Educational
        Campus is south of Buckle My Shoe Nursery School.

        at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that Worth Street is north
        of Grand Street, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is given
        because Worth Street (where Buckle My Shoe is located) is north of Grand Street
        (where Seward Park is located), not because they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. The answer directly
        addresses the comparative question of whether one location is north of the
        other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly identifies that they are at different locations (East
        44th Street vs East 85th/86th Street) and concludes that one is south of the
        other. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in location,
        with TKTS at 47th Street and PS 59 at 56th Street, concluding that TKTS is
        south of PS 59. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that TKTS TIMES SQUARE is not located north of PS 59.

        one location is south of the other (TKTS is south of PS 59), indicating a
        clear difference in position. The NO answer was given because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about making the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Ewen Playground is south of Faith
        Christian Academy, indicating a difference in location. The NO is because
        one location is south of the other, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Ewen Playground is not
        located north of Faith Christian Academy" as its final conclusion. This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is south of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The answer is definitive and includes the reasoning
        that one location is south of the other.

        location is south of the other, not because they are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (one is in southern Queens, the other
        in northeastern Queens) and concludes PATRICK JEROME GLEASON SQUARE is south

        there is a directional difference - that one location is in the south (Rockaway
        Beach) and the other is in the north (Bayside). The NO answer was given because
        of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        one location (Rockaway Beach) is south of the other location (Jamaica), indicating
        a clear directional difference between the two points.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that one location is in the southern part of Queens
        (Rockaway Beach) while the other is in the northern part (Bayside). The NO
        is given because one location is south of the other, not because they are
        at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear directional
        difference (south vs. northeast), not on the locations being equal. The model
        explicitly states one location is south while the other is northeast, indicating
        different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Rockaway Beach is slightly further south and west compared to
        Arverne" and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Unity Plaza is
        south of Trinity CME Methodist Church, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, stating that Unity Plaza is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that UNITY PLAZA is south of TRINITY CME METHODIST CHURCH, not because the
        locations are at the same position. It explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is southeast of the other), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that while the locations are "roughly aligned
        in terms of latitude," one is "slightly to the east." The presence of any
        difference, even if described as slight, means this is not a case of equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" due to lacking location data. This indicates it cannot make
        the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (cannot confirm based on the
        given information)" which indicates it cannot determine the relative positions.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify or determine
        the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were the reason for
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and explains that without specific coordinates/addresses, it cannot
        make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

        Bay Community Center is "south of" Vernam Basin, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that one school is in
        the southern part and the other is in the northern part of Brooklyn, indicating
        different positions. The NO answer was given because PS 58 is south of (not
        north of) PS 32.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that PS 58 is south of PS 32, making a clear comparative
        determination.

        the two locations. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Brooklyn compared to MADIBA PREP." The NO is because one location is south
        of the other, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        a difference in location, with one being at 164th Street and the other at

        with Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics being on a higher-numbered street
        (near 169th-170th) compared to Mullaly Park (164th Street). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mullaly Park Soccer
        Field 1 is not located north of Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics"

        parts of the same complex.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its final answer,
        it immediately qualifies this as "speculative without specific location data"
        and earlier states "we cannot definitively answer the question." This indicates
        the model is actually expressing inability to determine the answer rather

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it reasons that since one location encompasses
        the other (the complex contains the building), it cannot be north of its own
        building. This is a logical relationship reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as

        or the same. Instead, it explains that one location (Building 5) is contained
        within the other (Group 4), which is its reason for saying NO. This is a different
        relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it reasons that since one location (Building
        5) is part of the larger complex (Group 4), the complex cannot be north of
        its own building. The answer is based on logical containment rather than equal
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it explains that one location (BUILDING 5) is a subset/part
        of the larger group, and uses this relationship as the reason for its NO answer,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats about inability to determine or verify the comparison.

    bbe4a491-5e33-4f1a-aaf0-8985131181ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because
        there was "no clear evidence" to confirm the north-south relationship. The
        model discusses uncertainty about relative positions rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations. While the model indicates uncertainty about
        the relative positions, it provides a clear "NO" as its comparative conclusion
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        or identical. Instead, it explains that one location (Building 5) is likely
        part of or within the other location (Group 4), which is the reason for its
        NO answer. This indicates a spatial relationship rather than equality.

        or the same. Instead, it suggests that Building 5 is likely part of Group
        4 and would be positioned differently (possibly north of the main facility).
        The NO answer is based on reasoning about building layouts, not because the
        locations are identical.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (cannot be determined with the
        given information)". Since this is explicitly stating an inability to determine
        the comparison rather than a comparative result, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN. The parenthetical clarification makes it clear this is a "cannot
        determine" response rather than a comparative NO.

        one component within the larger area. The NO answer is based on the complex
        not being entirely north of Building 3, not because of equal positions.

        it argues that the comparison is logically inconsistent because a complex
        cannot be directionally related to its own part. This is a different type
        of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is because one location
        (Coney Island Houses) contains the other (Building 3), making the comparison
        logically impossible. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.

        one school is south of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        stating that Explore Charter School is north of Parkside Preparatory Academy
        (they are in different neighborhoods, with one being in northern Brooklyn
        and one in southern Brooklyn). The NO answer appears to be given because the
        premise of the question (Parkside being north of Explore) is reversed from
        what the model determined to be true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations. This is a clear NO response to the comparative

        locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explained that the
        NO was because one location is definitively south of the other (Manhattanville
        being in Manhattan, which is south of the Bronx where the other location is).
        The model identified a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that MANHATTANVILLE REHABS GROUP 3 BUILDING 1 is not located
        north of CIDITTY KIDDIE PRE-K CENTER. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is south of
        the other. The NO answer is given because one location is south of the other,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Civil Court is south of Bushwick
        Houses, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Civil Court, Queens
        is not located north of Bushwick Houses Bldg 8, Brooklyn." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Kew Gardens
        (where Civil Court is) is "south and east" of Bushwick, indicating a clear
        directional difference. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (one south of the other), not because
        they are at the same location. The model explicitly states "Kew Gardens is
        south of Bushwick" as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Bushwick
        being north of Kew Gardens. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with one location being "further north" than the other. This difference in
        position is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides it as a direct comparative result based on the relative positions
        of the two locations.

    21921980-cad6-42bc-bf18-3386d045d734:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location (Randall's Island)
        is "slightly south" of the area where the other location (Washington Heights)
        is situated. This difference in position, even though described as "slightly,"
        means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. The answer is
        definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly describes a difference in positions,
        stating that Washington Heights (where Yeshiva is) is in the very northern
        part of Manhattan while Randalls Island (where FDNY Academy is) is further
        south relative to it. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, FDNY ACADEMY CON
        ED TRANSFORMER is not located north of YESHIVA HECHAL MOSHE BETH JACOB" as
        its conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that the FDNY Academy is "east and slightly
        north" of Washington Heights but "not directly north" of the yeshiva. The
        NO answer is based on the fact that one location is not directly north of
        the other, not because they are at the same location or coordinates.

        with one being in the southeastern part and the other in the northern part
        of Queens.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states they are in different parts of Queens (southern
        vs northern) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - it explicitly states that "Newtown Creek is slightly south of the Pomonok
        Houses" indicating a difference in position, even if slight. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        the Pomonok Houses are "further north" and that one location is "west" of
        the other. The NO answer is based on these positional differences, not on
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Hillman
        Houses is south of Williamsburg, not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Hillman Houses
        is in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, which is south of Williamsburg in

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not cite equality of values as a reason for its answer - it rejected the
        premise of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question by stating
        "there is no 'Williamsburg, Manhattan'" and that the "question is based on
        a false premise." When a model rejects the premises of the question, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than taking the explicit "NO" at face
        value.

        were equal - it instead stated that one location doesn't exist in Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question by stating
        "Williamsburg is not in Manhattan" and concludes with "NO". Since the model
        explicitly rejects the premise by saying one location doesn't exist in Manhattan,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "roughly at the
        same latitude or slightly south," this statement presents two possibilities
        (equal OR slightly different) and is not definitively stating they are equal
        as the primary reason for the NO answer. The "or slightly south" part indicates
        a potential difference in position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Williamsburg is "positioned slightly more north
        compared to the Lower East Side of Manhattan" where Hillman Houses is located.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, HILLMAN HOUSES, Manhattan
        is not located north of WILLIAMSBURG, Brooklyn" as its final answer. While
        the model notes issues with the premise (Williamsburg being in Manhattan),
        it still provides a clear NO comparative answer based on comparing with Williamsburg,
        Brooklyn.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model's reasoning
        was not about equal values but about the premise being invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question by stating
        "Williamsburg is not in Manhattan." While it states "NO" at the end, this
        NO is rejecting the premise rather than making a comparative judgment. This
        falls under the case where "the model rejects the premises of the question"
        which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "roughly at the
        same latitude," it also states that Hillman Houses is "potentially being slightly
        south of Williamsburg." Since it indicates a directional difference (even
        if slight), this is not a case where equality is the primary reason for the
        NO answer.

        difference
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Hillman Houses is "slightly south
        of Williamsburg." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether one location is north of the other. While it notes an issue
        with the premise (Williamsburg being in Brooklyn not Manhattan), it proceeds
        to make and state a clear directional comparison.

        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the two
        locations.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2. The model did not give a NO answer based
        on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        with a clear and direct answer that HENRY STREET SETTLEMENT CCC MONTGOMERY
        ST is located north of AL MAMOOR SCHOOL.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    c2bf7100-066f-48b8-9de4-f22305043de4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        and directions (Manhattan being west of Queens, Lower East Side being south),
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes
        differences in location and uses these differences to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d729d16c-eb27-4cab-bd6b-e78d6722d179:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Al Mamoor School
        is likely north of Henry Street Settlement, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Henry Street Settlement
        CCC Montgomery St, Manhattan is not located north of Al Mamoor School, Queens"
        as its final answer. This is a clear NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
