      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its final answer
        section, though it adds caveats about uncertainty. Since we're instructed
        to use the explicit YES/NO statement when given, and the model clearly states
        "I would lean towards YES," this should be classified as YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates there is a directional
        difference, noting that Morrisania (where Morris II Houses is located) is
        "somewhat north or northeast of Highbridge." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

    83975ca7-7492-4265-9a2e-1f17c7b447ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes as the primary reason for its NO answer. While it mentions
        they could be "at a similar latitude," this is presented as one possibility
        alongside others (potentially south). The NO appears to be based on the model's
        analysis of general neighborhood locations rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the
        model acknowledges limitations in its data, it still provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    87c70867-4e42-437b-bee2-c1785b0e4b4d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - instead, it concluded NO because it determined Highbridge Senior
        Center was likely south of Morris II Houses Building 14. The model explicitly
        described different relative positions (Highbridge being southwest, Morrisania
        being more central/south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that the Highbridge Senior Center would be south, not north,
        of Morris II Houses Building 14.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Highbridge Senior
        Center would be south of Morris II Houses Building 14, indicating a difference
        in position (with Highbridge being described as more southerly than Morrisania
        where Morris Houses are located).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

    b3de0f1c-896b-45db-9f63-a233ee0bb268:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it suggests one location is "slightly west and possibly
        slightly south or at a similar latitude" than the other. Even though it mentions
        "similar latitude" as a possibility, it still indicates directional differences
        (west) and does not base its NO answer on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While it expresses some uncertainty in its
        analysis, it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it is not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states Liberty
        Island is southwest of Brooklyn, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its reasoning that one
        location is likely more southern than the other, even while expressing uncertainty
        about exact positions. The model specifically suggests EL PUENTE is "in a
        more southern part" relative to IS 192.

        would likely be south of IS 192 THE LINDEN, based on the general geographic
        relationship between Brooklyn and Queens. The model identifies a directional
        difference (Brooklyn being south of Queens), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the comparison but provides a "NO" answer anyway. The NO is not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it writes "YES/NO" in its response, it immediately notes this is just
        a placeholder and that an accurate answer would require actual location data.

        values (40.6452 vs 40.6783), not because the values were equal. Even though
        these were hypothetical values, the model used this difference to conclude
        that one location would be south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        based on a hypothetical comparison showing the Red Carpet Inn Hotel would

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given as a default conclusion after explaining it cannot access
        real-time data, rather than because the locations are determined to be at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a comparative result rather than a statement about
        inability to determine or rejection of premises. While the model expresses

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gives the opposite reason - it assumes
        the hotel is in southern Brooklyn while Hope Gardens is in northern Brooklyn,
        indicating different locations with the hotel being south (not north) of the
        building.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in its reasoning. While the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same latitude/position. Instead, it specifically indicated that Seward
        Park Educational Campus is likely south of Buckle My Shoe Nursery School,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Seward Park Educational Campus is north of Buckle My Shoe
        Nursery School. The answer was clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both locations are in "the lower
        part of Manhattan," it does not explicitly state they are at the same location
        or latitude. In fact, it makes a directional comparison, stating that "Grand
        Street (where Seward Park Educational Campus is) is likely to be south of
        or around the same latitude as Worth Street." The presence of any directional
        difference, even if described as approximate, means this is not a case of
        equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Seward Park Educational
        Campus is not north of Buckle My Shoe Nursery School.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "Grand St is generally south of Worth St" and
        concludes Seward Park Educational Campus is south of Buckle My Shoe Nursery
        School.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it bases the answer on Queens being generally
        northeast of Brooklyn, suggesting a directional difference. The model acknowledges
        there could be exceptions but still concludes NO based on typical borough
        positioning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it gave a NO answer because
        it determined that one location was likely south of the other (Brooklyn being
        south of Queens), indicating a difference in positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations are equal/same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Brooklyn
        is south of Queens, and therefore Stroud Playground must be south (not north)
        of August Martin High School. The model indicated a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Stroud Playground is north of August Martin High School.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference, with Queens
        being north of Brooklyn. The model concluded NO because it determined one
        location was north of the other, not because they were at the same location
        or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning about Queens being north
        of Brooklyn to support this conclusion.

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it specifically states that Stroud Playground
        in Brooklyn would "generally be south of" August Martin High School in Queens,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In
        fact, it discusses various possible relative positions (one could be north
        or south of the other depending on specific locations). The NO answer appears
        to be based on inability to verify rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, even though it earlier expressed uncertainty

        the same position or equal coordinates. Instead, it gives a NO answer based
        on reasoning about the general geography of Brooklyn and Queens, suggesting
        one location is likely south of the other. The model notes it can't be completely
        certain but bases its NO on probable relative positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of specific address information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it heavily
        qualifies this as "speculative" and explicitly states multiple times that
        it lacks the specific information needed to make a definitive comparison.
        The response emphasizes uncertainty and inability to determine the actual
        relative positions without exact addresses. This makes it a case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states it "cannot verify" the locations and lacks the necessary information.
        The NO appears to be given reluctantly because "the format demands a YES or
        NO answer". This indicates inability to make the comparison, which meets the
        criteria for UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        or imply that the locations are equal/identical/the same. In fact, it indicates
        it lacks the information to determine their relative positions. The NO appears
        to be given due to inability to verify the northward relationship, not because
        the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it spends most of the response explaining its limitations in making
        the comparison. Since it does provide a clear "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        Park is south of PS 11 Thomas Dongan, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        access the location data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response. However, this NO is given with a clear caveat that it "cannot
        definitively say yes or no" due to lack of access to location data. Since
        the model explicitly states it cannot determine the answer, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that PS 11 Thomas Dongan is "more central
        or northward relative to the park," suggesting a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        indicates that it lacks the specific location data needed to make the comparison,
        but still provides a NO answer without citing equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty about the data needed to make the comparison,
        it still provides this definitive comparative answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        the final answer as NO, the model never stated the locations were equal -
        it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clearly indicates it cannot determine the actual relative
        positions without specific location data, making this effectively a statement
        of inability to verify. The model even states "without actual addresses or
        a map to confirm the locations... I must default to a position of uncertainty."
        This makes it clear that the NO is given only because of the forced choice
        format, not as a genuine comparative result.

        qualifies this as speculative and explicitly states it cannot verify the locations.
        The model repeatedly emphasizes it lacks the necessary information to make

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        as a "placeholder" and indicates that "actual research is needed for a definitive
        response." Throughout the response, it emphasizes that it cannot make the
        determination without specific location data. This makes it clear that the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses doubt about the premises
        and locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or identical
        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO appears to be based on concerns about
        the validity of the comparison due to one location potentially being in a
        different borough, not because the locations are at the same coordinates or
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the premises. Since the
        NO is clearly stated as the answer (not as "NO, I cannot determine"), this

        that it "might not reflect the actual geographical relationship." The model
        explicitly states it's "challenging to provide a definitive answer" and lacks

        explaining that one location is south of the other (Colonel Charles Young
        Triangle is in Manhattan which is south of the Bronx where Bronx International
        Academy is located). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        PS 59 is north of TKTS Times Square ("PS 59 Beekman Hill International School
        is located north of the TKTS Times Square booth"), indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result based on geographic
        analysis. The answer is bolded and comes after clear reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes that PS 59 is at a higher street number and more
        north than TKTS Times Square. The NO answer is given because PS 59 is north
        of TKTS, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that TKTS
        Times Square is south of PS 59 (63rd Street is north of 46th-47th Streets).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether TKTS Times Square is north of PS 59 Beekman Hill International
        School. The model provides specific geographical reasoning and concludes with
        a definitive "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that TKTS Times Square is south of PS 59, being at a lower street number (42nd-47th
        Streets vs 63rd Street). The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result about the geographic relationship between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (PS 59 being north of TKTS), not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states that PS 59 is at 56th Street while TKTS is in the 42nd-47th
        Street range, indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        indicating a clear difference in location. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the relative positions
        of the two locations. The model explicitly states "the answer to whether TKTS
        Times Square is located north of PS 59 Beekman Hill International School is
        NO."

    b45b5682-1fc5-4933-8bd8-aaf4fd7d8909:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had classified the final word "NO" as the answer, there was no statement
        about equal values being the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning leading
        up to it explicitly states "we can't definitively conclude" and "a definitive
        answer cannot be precisely determined". The model acknowledges it's being
        speculative and lacks necessary data. This makes it a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c21a2c5e-881a-4f62-83e6-88ca135dead6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions without more specific information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" as its final
        answer, it heavily qualifies this as "a reasoned guess rather than a definitive
        answer" and repeatedly emphasizes throughout that it "cannot be determined
        with certainty without more specific location details." This indicates the
        model is actually expressing inability to make the comparison, making this
        an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same as its reason for saying NO. While it expresses uncertainty about
        the exact locations, it never claims they are at the same latitude or equally
        north/south. The NO appears to be given due to insufficient information rather
        than proven equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response. While it expresses uncertainty about the locations

        claimed the locations were equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "YES" at the end,
        it heavily qualifies this as "highly speculative" and explicitly states "a
        definitive answer can't be accurately provided." The model is essentially
        indicating it cannot determine the answer without specific location data,
        making this a case where it cannot make the comparison.

    f9db8fe5-90c8-4fda-a8a4-1e1fb190ddf5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO as an answer based on the lack of specific
        information to verify the north/south relationship, not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates or position. The model suggests that without address
        information, it cannot confirm if the preschool is north of the marina.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While the model acknowledges uncertainty and

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it stated "YES or NO" as a placeholder while emphasizing that it

        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it indicated it lacks sufficient
        information to make the comparison but provided NO as an answer anyway. The
        NO was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While it expresses uncertainty about the locations throughout its
        analysis, it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer, not
        a refusal to answer or rejection of the premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it suggests that Manhattan is generally southwest
        of Queens and concludes NO based on geographical positioning, not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. While it mentions they "might" be
        at "similar latitude," this is presented as a possibility rather than the
        reason for the NO answer.

        expressed, the model indicates a directional difference rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though it notes some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear directional conclusion rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine, this counts as a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or elevation. Instead, it indicates there is a directional
        difference, stating that Far Rockaway (where Ocean Bay Community Center is)
        is "south or southeast" of the Jamaica Bay area (where Vernam Basin is presumed
        to be). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative directional
        conclusion.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a difference in position, with "Vernam Basin being more to the north
        and the Ocean Bay Community Center being more to the south." This directional
        difference is the reason for the NO answer.

        locations were equal - it actually couldn't determine their relative positions
        due to missing data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning shows
        it cannot actually determine the answer due to missing location data for ORWELL
        HOUSE BUILDING. The model explicitly states "it's not possible to definitively
        answer the question" and only provides NO because it feels forced to choose.

        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it bases the NO answer on an assumption that the Boys Club
        is likely in Midtown or Upper Manhattan, which would make it north of the
        NYU residence hall in Greenwich Village. The model is suggesting a difference
        in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model discusses
        various scenarios and limitations, it ultimately commits to a NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        discusses uncertainty about exact locations but makes a determination based
        on typical distribution patterns, not because the locations are equal.

      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", the model extensively
        explains that it cannot determine the north-south orientation without precise
        mapping data and GPS coordinates. The model explicitly states "addresses alone
        do not conclusively determine north-south orientation without a map." This
        indicates the model cannot make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN

    5ef27dea-0650-49da-9c8b-3ef0a7d69441:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing some uncertainty in its reasoning. The
        answer was clearly stated as a comparative result.

    7ac09408-3c28-41d6-9aed-a9d5bd9ec317:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Mullaly Park (at 164th St) is south of the Bronx Center (at 180th-181st
        St), not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states there is a
        difference in their positions, with one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are "relatively
        close to each other," it explicitly states there is a difference in their
        positions, with one being "slightly south" of the other (Mullaly Park at E164th
        vs Bronx Center at E165th). The NO answer is based on this difference in position,
        not on the locations being equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. The answer is clear and
        direct, making this a definitive NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d23c5640-78bd-4c28-b736-4dee84ca8af3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that one location is south of the other (Mullaly
        Park at 164th St is south of Bronx Center at 172nd St). The NO is based on
        a directional difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the relative locations. The answer is definitive and based on a specific
        directional comparison.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        **YES**" at the end of its response after working through its reasoning steps.'

    0eb506ea-4efd-4d1a-88b9-3b3c5af42c98:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal or the same - it actually emphasized that it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions and lacks necessary information. The model states "we cannot determine
        their relative positions accurately" and the NO appears to be given only because
        it felt forced to choose between YES/NO. This makes it a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are likely
        very close or in the same complex, it never explicitly states they are at
        exactly the same location or have equal north-south positions. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to uncertainty about their relative positions rather
        than because of confirmed equality. The model specifically mentions that "the
        difference in their locations might be minimal" which acknowledges some potential
        difference exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format. While it expresses uncertainty and caveats throughout its
        reasoning, it ultimately commits to a NO answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it discusses them as potentially different locations
        within the same complex, with one being "BUILDING 5" and implies they might
        have different positions. The NO answer appears to be given due to inability
        to verify the relationship, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model discusses
        limitations in making the determination, it still provides a clear NO as its
        final comparative answer.

    80ef2fb7-c964-4763-9449-adfab8d9b219:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given despite uncertainty rather than because the locations
        are determined to be at the same position. The model does not cite equality
        of position as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal or the same - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as its final answer, but the
        explanation leading up to it indicates it "cannot be definitively determined"
        and there's "an inability to confirm the statement as true." This makes it
        clear the model is saying NO because it cannot determine the answer, not as
        a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      result: UNKNOWN
    8bb23ebe-be58-4960-99ca-59751674d182:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the final "NO" as the answer, the model never states the locations are equal/same/identical
        - it simply states it lacks information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but prefaces it by stating
        it cannot definitively determine the relationship and that any answer would
        be speculative. Since the model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        conclude the north-south relationship" and that answering would be "speculative,"
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        never claimed the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it
        couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning given indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        ("we cannot accurately determine the north-south orientation"). Since the
        model is essentially saying it cannot make the determination, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it suggests they are likely different buildings within
        the same complex. The NO answer appears to be given due to inability to verify
        the northern position, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model discusses
        limitations in making the determination, it still provides a clear NO as its
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal/identical - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, it explicitly states multiple times that it "cannot determine" the relationship
        and that it's "impossible to definitively say." The NO appears to be given
        reluctantly only because the model felt forced to give a YES/NO answer. This
        makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ea99faeb-2e6e-430f-86e7-a641e800ed25:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer due to equal values - it gave what amounts to an
        "unable to determine" response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO means an inability to confirm the location ("This answer reflects
        the inability to confirm the location based on the provided information").
        This makes it a case where the model is indicating it cannot determine the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in bold and as the "Actual Answer". Although it notes this is based on
        assumptions and hypotheticals, it still provides a clear YES answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked
        the data to make a comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, it indicates it cannot determine the actual positions due
        to lack of data ("without access to real-time data", "I will not be able to
        give an accurate answer based on actual locations"). Since the model explicitly
        states it cannot make the determination, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I will not provide a

        even if we had considered the hypothetical "NO" as the final answer, the model
        never stated the locations were equal/same/identical as a reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the end,
        it explicitly labels this as a "Hypothetical Answer for Exercise Purposes
        Only" and repeatedly emphasizes that it cannot make a real determination without
        actual location data. The model makes it clear it's not providing a genuine
        comparative result, but rather a placeholder answer. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison without
        the necessary information.

        that the values (latitudes) are equal as the reason. In fact, it doesn't specify
        the actual relationship between the locations at all. The NO appears to be
        given due to inability to verify the relationship rather than due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with a clear "NO" after explaining
        its reasoning process. While it discusses hypotheticals and limitations of
        data access throughout, it ultimately provides a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        the necessary data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately qualifies it as a "placeholder due to the lack of actual data."
        Throughout the response, it emphasizes that it cannot make the actual comparison
        without address data. This makes it clear that the model is indicating it

        it cannot verify the actual locations and lacks the data to make the comparison.
        The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it spends most of the response explaining why it cannot make the
        determination. Since it gives a clear NO rather than stating it cannot determine
        the answer, we classify based on the explicit final answer given.

        FOR LEADERSHIP AND JOURNALISM (231st Street), indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        of its response after extensive reasoning. While it expresses uncertainty
        throughout, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal or the same - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to lack of data. Since the model explicitly states it "cannot
        determine" the relationship and is only providing NO because it "must provide
        a YES or NO answer," this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to insufficient information to confirm a northern
        position, not because the locations are determined to be at the same position.
        The model never explicitly states the locations are equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations. While it expresses uncertainty about the exact locations throughout
        its analysis, it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it states it "cannot confirm the north-south
        relationship" due to lack of data. The NO is based on insufficient information
        to verify the relationship, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, providing a clear comparative answer rather than indicating inability
        to determine or refusing to answer. While it expresses uncertainty in its
        reasoning, it commits to a definitive NO answer.

        at a similar or slightly north latitude" and makes its NO determination based
        on Bensonhurst being more southern. Since it indicates a directional difference
        (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in

        locations and discusses the complexity of Brooklyn's geography, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. The model's NO answer appears
        to be based on its analysis of street layouts and general geography, not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model never claims the locations
        are at equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it arrives at NO because it believes Sperandeo Brothers
        Playground is likely south of Liberty Avenue Middle School, indicating a difference
        in position. The uncertainty in its reasoning doesn't change that it's describing
        a directional difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about precise
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it suggests there is a directional difference (with Liberty Avenue area being
        "more to the east and slightly north of Bensonhurst"). The NO answer is based
        on this perceived directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses some uncertainty about the precision of its comparison.
        Since it provides a clear directional conclusion rather than refusing to answer

        on the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        without any caveats about inability to verify or determine. While it discusses

    1cd1cedd-cd4e-4ec5-937b-a4483d534262:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions due to missing information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, it repeatedly emphasizes that it cannot make a definitive comparison
        without knowing Phyl's Academy's exact location. The model explicitly states
        "without the exact location, the precise answer cannot be definitively provided"
        and only gives NO as a "reasoned but uncertain response" because it was forced
        to choose. This indicates the model is actually expressing inability to determine
        the answer while complying with format requirements.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    45fbf8bc-910e-4555-9057-5efc6ec838d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it arrives at NO by assuming Phyl's Academy is in a
        more northern part of Brooklyn than the Sunset Park Bathhouse, which is explicitly
        described as being in the southwestern part. The NO answer is based on this
        assumed difference in positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" after making assumptions about the locations. While the model expresses
        uncertainty and makes assumptions, it does provide a clear NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.'

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sunset Park Bathhouse is south
        of Phyl's Academy, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on an assumed scenario where
        Phyl's Academy would be in a more northern location than Sunset Park Bathhouse.
        Even though there is uncertainty, the NO is based on a hypothetical difference
        in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer despite earlier

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer while acknowledging uncertainty
        about exact locations and indicating that Sunset Park is "somewhat central-south."
        The NO is not based on the locations being equal/identical, but rather on
        incomplete information and general geographic assumptions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it did not state that the locations were equal or the same. In
        fact, it based its NO answer on the reasoning about relative positions in
        Brooklyn, not on any equality between the locations. The model never claimed
        the locations were identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "ANSWER: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, even though it expressed uncertainty in its

        with Canarsie being southeast and Brooklyn College being in a more central-southern
        location but north of Canarsie. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        being more central but southern. The NO answer was given because Canarsie
        was determined to be south/southeast of Brooklyn College, not because they
        were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        it heavily qualifies this as "speculative" and repeatedly emphasizes that
        it "cannot definitively say" and lacks sufficient information to determine

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the explanation makes
        it clear that it cannot determine the actual locations or make the comparison.
        The model explicitly states "without access to real-time data or specific
        maps" and "I cannot perform this step with the provided information." This
        indicates an inability to make the determination rather than a comparative

        Marshall's Gateway Center is in the southern part of Brooklyn while the playground
        might be in a more central/northern area. Since the NO answer is based on
        a potential difference in position (even if uncertain) rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the very end of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While
        the model expresses uncertainty and caveats throughout, it ultimately commits

        Instead, it gave NO based on reasoning about relative positions, suggesting
        Gateway Center is likely south of the playground due to its waterfront location.
        The uncertainty in the reasoning doesn't change that equality was not given

        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests
        that Marshall's Gateway Center is "generally in the southern part of the borough"
        and implies a comparison would be possible with proper location data. The
        NO answer is not based on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about the actual locations. Since it provides
        a clear NO as the comparative result (rather than saying it cannot determine),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        any specific comparison of their positions at all, merely stating that the
        NO answer is based on "the structure of the question and the lack of specific

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges this is based on hypothetical reasoning rather

        stating that Dyckman is "south or more accurately, southwest of CO-OP CITY."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        other (the church is in Manhattan which is south of the Bronx where the building
        is located), and this difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        south of Queens, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model specifically mentions that Manhattan is "south of the majority of
        Queens" and concludes that "an apartment in Manhattan is likely to be south
        of a location in Queens."

        were equal/same/identical as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the very end, this
        appears inconsistent with its earlier reasoning where it explicitly states
        it "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer without performing the actual
        lookup of addresses." Given this contradiction and the model's clear statement

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it describes them as being in different areas with
        HELP USA being "south or at least not significantly north" of Montefiore.
        The NO answer is based on relative positions being different, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether one location is north of the other. The answer is clearly
        stated and presented as a comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its analysis that Crotona Park
        North is "likely not north of Westchester Square" because both are "in the
        southern to mid-sections of the Bronx." The model is making a directional
        comparison, not stating the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its analysis, making a clear comparative judgment about
        the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it specifically indicated that one location was "south or southwest
        of" the other, showing a directional difference. This difference, not equality,
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.

        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        though it heavily qualifies this with uncertainty and notes it's a "reasoned
        guess." Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit final answer regardless
        of qualifications, and the model clearly states "YES," this should be classified
        as YES.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it suggests that HCZ facilities are likely south of St.
        Nicholas Houses, indicating a difference in location. The uncertainty expressed
        doesn't change that the model's NO is based on a presumed difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about the exact locations. Since it provides
        a clear comparative answer despite the uncertainty, rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating it cannot determine, this counts as a NO answer.

        is likely south of the housing project due to street numbering patterns. The
        model notes potential differences in location, even while acknowledging some
        uncertainty.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately qualifies it as "speculative without actual location data"
        and throughout the response emphasizes it cannot make a definitive determination
        without specific geographic data. This indicates it cannot actually verify

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but qualifies
        this by saying it "cannot accurately determine the relative positions" and
        "the question cannot be definitively answered." This indicates the model is
        actually stating it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for
        UNKNOWN.

        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same in terms of their
        north-south positioning. The NO answer appears to be given despite uncertainty
        rather than due to equal positions. Since equality is not stated as the reason
        for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty about

        were equal - it stated it couldn't verify their locations at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but earlier states it
        "cannot verify" and "must conclude without a definitive YES or NO." Since
        the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to lack of verifiable
        data about the locations, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the

        due to lack of information. The NO answer is not based on the locations being
        equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their locations at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the locations or make
        the comparison ("lack of clear, verifiable information", "cannot accurately
        determine the relationship"). The model even states it would prefer to "acknowledge
        that we cannot accurately determine the relationship." This makes it clear
        that the NO is given because it cannot make the determination, not as a comparative
        result, which qualifies for UNKNOWN per the criteria.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        verify their existence or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does give "NO" as an answer, it explicitly
        states it "cannot accurately determine their relative positions" and that
        the premises (existence and locations) could not be verified. This makes it
        a case where the model is rejecting the ability to make the comparison, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but it clearly indicates throughout that it cannot verify the locations
        or make a determination due to lack of data. The model states "providing an
        accurate YES or NO answer based on actual geographical data is not feasible"
        and emphasizes that any answer would be speculative. This is effectively rejecting
        the premises of the question due to inability to verify the locations.

        it gives a NO answer based on the reasoning that Brooklyn is generally south
        of Queens. The model notes a directional difference (Brooklyn being south
        of Queens), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        noted some uncertainty about specific addresses, it based its NO answer on
        this directional difference.

        Even though this is described in general terms, it still indicates a directional
        difference rather than equality.

        of Brooklyn being south of Queens. The model actually emphasizes potential
        differences in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" as its answer, though
        it expresses some uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it does provide
        an explicit "NO" answer based on general geographic tendencies, rather than

        (central vs northwestern part of Staten Island) and uses this difference in
        location as the basis for its NO answer. The model specifically notes that
        Markham Gardens is "more north" than the area where the Reformed Church is

        it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal or identical in their
        north-south positioning. The model's uncertainty and lack of precise location

        or the same. In fact, it suggests they are likely in different areas (with
        Markham Gardens in the northwest Port Richmond area and the church potentially
        in central/southern parts). The NO answer appears to be based on their relative
        positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is presented as a comparative result based on its analysis of
        the locations, not as an inability to determine or verify. While the model
        expresses uncertainty in its analysis, it still provides a definitive NO answer.

        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO", it immediately qualifies
        this by saying a "definitive comparison cannot be made" due to lack of information

        to be at the same position. The model does not cite equality of position as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about being able to make the comparison due
        to lack of information about Gregory's Garden's location. Since this NO appears
        to be given despite the uncertainty rather than because of it (i.e., not "NO,

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly determines that they are at different
        positions, with the cruise terminal being south of the church. The NO answer
        is given because one location is south of the other, not because they are
        at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in locations,
        with the Church being at 74th Street and the Terminal being at 52nd-54th Streets.
        The NO was given because the relationship was reversed from what was asked
        (Church is north of Terminal, not Terminal north of Church).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, indicating that the Manhattan Cruise Terminal
        is NOT north of the Church of the Epiphany (in fact, it concludes the opposite
        - that the Church is north of the Terminal).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a difference in location, with the Cruise Terminal being south of
        the church ("the Cruise Terminal is actually south of the church, not north").
        The NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that the Manhattan
        Cruise Terminal is not north of the Church of the Epiphany. The model gives
        specific reasoning for this answer based on street locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the Church of the Epiphany
        (at 74th Street) is north of the Manhattan Cruise Terminal (at 52nd Street),
        indicating a clear difference in their positions. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that the Manhattan Cruise Terminal is
        not north of the Church of the Epiphany. This was a direct answer to the comparative

        the Terminal is south of the Church, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the relative positions of the two locations.

        in fact, it explicitly describes their differences, stating the cruise terminal
        is south of the church and that they are on opposite sides of Manhattan (west
        vs east). The NO answer is given because the cruise terminal is determined
        to be south of, not north of, the church.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that one location is likely
        south of the other ("assuming the school is in a more southern part of Manhattan").
        The model acknowledges uncertainty but provides directional reasoning for
        its answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it indicates that Manhattan is south of Queens,
        meaning there is a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be NO"
        as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative directional answer
        based on the relative positions of Manhattan and Queens.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it gives a NO answer based on the reasoning that the Brooklyn location could
        be north of the Manhattan location depending on specific positioning. Since
        the NO is not based on equality of positions, but rather on potential relative
        positions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about exact locations throughout
        its analysis. Since it provides this clear comparative answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine, the final answer should
        be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison,
        stating that Two Bridges in Manhattan would likely be south of the church's
        location in Brooklyn. The NO is not due to the locations being equal/same/identical,
        but rather due to one being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning for why TWO BRIDGES SENIOR

        without exact location data. This makes it clear that the model cannot actually
        determine the answer with confidence.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Ravenswood being "more south" and Bayside being "more north".
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a comparative directional analysis leading to this conclusion.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Ravenswood
        is "south or southwest of Bayside" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The model never states that the locations are at the same position
        or elevation, but rather identifies a specific directional relationship between
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        as its conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that Ravenswood Projects is "south of Bayside Annex Post Office"
        and gives this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographic analysis,
        not as a refusal or inability to determine.'

        locations are in different positions (Ravenswood is south of Bayside), not
        because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about locations
        and indicates it lacks data to make a proper comparison, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer appears to be given
        due to insufficient data rather than because the locations are determined
        to be at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it spends most of the response explaining why it cannot make a
        determination without addresses. Since it provides a clear "NO" at the end,
        we must classify based on this explicit final answer, regardless of the reasoning
        leading up to it.

        NO), this is automatically False per the criteria. Additionally, the response
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions due to missing address data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot accurately determine" and "cannot be definitively answered" due
        to missing location data. The NO appears to be given reluctantly just to comply
        with the format request, while actually indicating inability to determine.
        This matches the UNKNOWN criteria of "cannot make the comparison".
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    6777e262-2cf3-4547-8005-aebdf8c9f496:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked the data to make any
        determination.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it explicitly
        says this is speculative and that a "YES or NO answer requires actual location
        data." The model clearly indicates it cannot make the determination without
        access to the necessary data. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it as a "placeholder" and indicates it cannot make the actual comparison without
        location data. This makes it clear that the model cannot determine the answer,
        so this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        because one location is south of the other, not because they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and determining that Parkside Preparatory Academy
        is south of (not north of) Explore Charter School.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        school is south of the other, not because they are at the same location. The
        model explicitly states "PARKSIDE PREPARATORY ACADEMY, located near Prospect
        Park, would typically be south of EXPLORE CHARTER SCHOOL." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a difference in position,
        stating that "Parkside Preparatory Academy is located south of Explore Charter
        School." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Parkside Preparatory Academy is located north of Explore
        Charter School. The model provides a detailed analysis leading to this definitive
        comparative conclusion.

        locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions without address data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first says "YES or NO" and then chooses
        "NO" as a "placeholder answer" while acknowledging it cannot actually determine
        the answer without specific location data. This indicates it cannot make the
        comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO.

        relative positions without access to specific location data. Since the model
        explicitly states it "cannot definitively determine the relative positions"
        and gives a NO answer only because it's forced to provide one without having
        the necessary information, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide this
        definitive comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        that the locations could have "the same latitude", it does not state this
        is actually the case, nor does it give this as the reason for its NO answer.
        In fact, it suggests this scenario is "less likely". The NO appears to be
        given due to inability to verify rather than due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about the data throughout. Since it provides
        a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

        is in the northern part of Brooklyn, making it less likely for another location
        to be north of it. The model's NO is based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response after working through its reasoning steps. While it expresses

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        labels this as a "placeholder answer" and indicates it cannot make the actual
        determination without specific location data. This effectively means the model
        is indicating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        it did not state that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it suggested
        they could be in different parts of Brooklyn. The NO answer appears to be
        based on insufficient information rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        analysis, though it expressed uncertainty about the exact locations. Since
        it provided a clear NO as its final comparative answer, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN, even though the reasoning suggested uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was determined to be southwest of the other, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison showing GOWANUS HOUSES BUILDING
        8 is southwest of MOFFAT STREET COMMUNITY GARDEN.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    99923b53-4367-400e-bb56-05f0108e337f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Gowanus Houses being south of Moffat Street Community Garden), not because
        the locations are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison (indicating one location
        is south of the other, not north).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        also did not claim the locations were equal/identical - it simply stated it
        couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it explicitly
        acknowledges this is speculative and that it cannot actually determine the
        relative positions without data. The model clearly indicates it cannot make
        the comparison ("without access to real-time mapping data", "challenging to
        provide a definitive answer", "don't have the specific data to accurately
        compare"). This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its reasoning that
        Gowanus is generally southwest of Bushwick, indicating a difference in relative
        positions. While it expresses uncertainty about exact locations, it never
        suggests the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response after working through the reasoning steps. While it expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear final NO answer.'

    efcf61d2-f5f1-4fa2-820d-3d4a80583816:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Gowanus Houses would be south of Moffat Street Community Garden, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was given because one location was
        determined to be south of the other, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative positions of
        the two locations. The answer is explicitly stated and used as a comparative
        result.

        locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked the data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but indicates
        it cannot make the determination due to lack of data ("without specific data
        to compare their locations"). Since the model indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "YES / NO" without clearly choosing
        either option. Throughout the response, it explains that it cannot determine
        the actual answer without specific location data. This makes it an UNKNOWN
        response since no clear YES/NO answer was provided.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but qualifies
        this by saying it cannot make an accurate determination due to lack of specific
        location data. Since the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        notes this is speculative and that it cannot verify locations without data.
        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison without actual location
        data, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the response never suggests
        the locations are equal - it simply states it lacks information to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning leading
        up to it explicitly states it cannot determine the locations and lacks information
        to make the comparison. The "NO" appears to be given as a "default response
        based on the inability to determine their locations accurately" rather than
        as a comparative result. This makes it a case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

        locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but indicates this is because it cannot make the determination due
        to lack of data ("without direct access to current, specific data on these
        locations"). This is effectively stating it cannot verify or determine the
        answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the possibility of schools
        being "at the same latitude" as one scenario that would result in NO, this
        is not stated as the actual reason for its final NO answer. The model explicitly
        states it lacks the data to make the comparison and appears to default to
        NO due to inability to verify, not because of confirmed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty about the actual locations. Since
        it provides a clear NO answer (not a "NO, I cannot verify" or similar qualification),
        this should be classified as NO.

        the final "NO" as the answer, the model never stated the locations were equal
        - it simply couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, it explicitly indicates this is just a placeholder answer due to inability
        to determine the actual locations. The model clearly states it "cannot perform
        the actual lookup or comparison without more data" and lacks "specific geographic
        information about both schools." This makes it a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        answer as NO, the model never stated the locations were equal - it simply
        stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but indicates
        it cannot actually verify the locations and is only providing this answer
        because it feels compelled to give a YES/NO response. Since the model clearly
        indicates it cannot determine the actual comparison and is only giving NO
        as a forced guess, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        they might be in different positions based on their numbering sequence, though
        it's uncertain about the direction. The NO answer appears to be based on speculation
        about navigational sequencing rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty and caveats about making the comparison. Since
        it provides this definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same
        - it actually specified that one location was more south than the other (Jerome
        Hardeman Early Childhood Center being more south than Bowne Street Community
        Church). The NO answer was based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, without indicating inability
        to determine or rejecting premises.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, it gives NO due to lack of information
        about one location's position ("without the exact address of CAFE METRO").
        Since equality is not stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should
        be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after some
        deliberation, though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison due to
        incomplete information about one location. Since it ultimately provides a
        clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to missing information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it explicitly
        indicates this is just a "placeholder response" and that it's "not possible
        to provide a definitive YES or NO answer" due to missing location information.
        The model is effectively indicating it cannot determine the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the possibility of locations
        being "at the same latitude" as one scenario that would result in NO, this
        is not stated as the actual reason for the NO answer. The model gives a hypothetical
        NO that could be due to the location being either south OR at the same latitude.
        Since equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this
        should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO" after its analysis. While the model acknowledges uncertainty in the
        premises, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to

        positions due to missing information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as its final answer,
        the bulk of the response indicates it cannot make the comparison without knowing
        CAFE METRO's specific location. The model explicitly states "we cannot definitively
        say whether it is located north of the BROOKLYN SUPREME COURT CIVIL" and acknowledges
        that a precise answer would require more information. This makes it clear
        that the model cannot determine the answer, despite providing a "NO" at the
        end.

        on the final explicit answer, and the model clearly states "YES" at the end,
        this should be classified as YES.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" but indicates
        it cannot make the determination due to lack of data about CAFE METRO's location.
        Since the model states it "cannot definitively determine" and gives NO because
        it lacks information, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        scenarios. The NO is not based on the locations being equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations. Since it
        provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot

        It describes a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Newtown
        Creek Water Pollution Control Plant Digester Building in Brooklyn is not located
        north of Pomonok Houses Building 17 in Queens." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were at equal
        latitude/longitude. Instead, it explained that one location is south of the
        other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given because
        the model determined the Newtown Creek facility is south of (not north of)
        Pomonok Houses.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the Newtown Creek facility is north of Pomonok Houses.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines
        one location is south of the other (Brooklyn location is south of Queens location).
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in bold, making a direct comparative judgment about the relative
        positions of the two locations.

        concluding that "the Newtown Creek Water Pollution Control Plant Digester
        Building in Brooklyn is generally south of the Pomonok Houses Building 17
        in Queens." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined the
        Newtown Creek facility is south of Pomonok Houses, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, indicating that the Newtown Creek facility is
        south of Pomonok Houses. This directional difference, not equality, was the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion, providing
        a direct comparative answer based on its geographical analysis that the Newtown
        Creek facility is south of Pomonok Houses.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference, concluding that one
        location was likely south of the other. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that the Newtown Creek facility is likely south

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated that
        one location doesn't exist in Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but it also indicates that the premise is flawed since Williamsburg
        is in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. Since the model rejects the premises of the
        question by stating one location doesn't exist in Manhattan, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations are in a "similar
        latitude," it also notes that Hillman Houses would be "slightly north" of
        the Williamsburg Bridge area. Since it indicates there is a directional difference
        (even if slight), this does not qualify as stating the values are exactly
        equal. The NO answer appears to be based on the premise that Hillman Houses
        is not significantly north of the reference point, rather than being at exactly
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it points
        out that Williamsburg isn't even in Manhattan and discusses relative positions,
        suggesting Hillman Houses would be south of many Manhattan locations. The
        NO appears to be based on rejecting the premise that Hillman Houses is north
        of Williamsburg in Manhattan, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it discusses issues with the premise (Williamsburg being in Brooklyn),
        it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equality of
        values is not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not indicate the locations were equal - it actually stated they couldn't
        be compared because one location wasn't in Manhattan at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one of the locations (Williamsburg) is not in
        Manhattan as the question premise assumes. When a model rejects the premises
        of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than taking the
        explicit NO at face value.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/identical. Instead, it explained that one location
        (Williamsburg) isn't even in Manhattan, and discussed relative positions with
        Hillman Houses being south of Williamsburg (in Brooklyn). The NO wasn't based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" at the end
        of its response, though it noted issues with the premise. Since it provided
        a clear NO as its final comparative answer (rather than rejecting the comparison
        entirely), this should be classified as NO.

        the locations are equal or the same. The NO appears to be based on the fact
        that Williamsburg is in Brooklyn rather than Manhattan, pointing out an error
        in the premise. The model does not state that the locations are at the same
        position or elevation.

        the final answer as NO, the model never states the locations are equal - rather
        it explains they're in different boroughs entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its "Direct Answer"
        at the end, but the explanation indicates this is primarily because one location
        (Williamsburg) is not in Manhattan as assumed by the question. Since the model
        rejects a key premise of the question (that both locations are in Manhattan),
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        and "would not be significantly north," but still implies some positional
        difference. The NO answer appears to be based on this relative positioning
        rather than exact equality.

        a clear comparative conclusion based on the general geography of NYC.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9bd1433d-810d-451b-84fa-753f64d65900:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO because Manhattan is generally south of
        Queens, indicating a directional difference. While expressing uncertainty
        about exact locations, it never claims the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer, even though it expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b8cda030-858b-48cf-b878-fa0d5e5426b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same in terms of their
        north-south position. The NO answer appears to be given due to inability to
        make a determination rather than because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about making the determination. Since
        it provides a clear NO answer (not saying "NO, I cannot determine"), this
        should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ca8231f2-19c3-4a2c-9786-79c58678b72c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it gives a NO answer because
        it believes one location is likely south of the other (specifically mentioning
        that the Lower East Side of Manhattan is generally south of Queens). Even
        though it expresses uncertainty about exact positions, it bases its NO on
        a directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, based
        on general principles and the information provided: NO". While it expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear final NO answer
        to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e30c2eb9-d0f3-4ff8-b6fb-f5fd961a8b59:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes HENRY
        STREET SETTLEMENT is likely south of AL MAMOOR SCHOOL, indicating a directional
        difference. Even though there is some uncertainty, the model suggests a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it both in the conclusion and as a clear "Answer: NO" at the end.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
