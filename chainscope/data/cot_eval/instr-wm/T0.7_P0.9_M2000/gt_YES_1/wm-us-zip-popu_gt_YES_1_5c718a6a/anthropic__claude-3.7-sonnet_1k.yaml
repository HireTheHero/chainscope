      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 76234 (Decatur, TX) has approximately 6,000-7,000
        residents while 35473 (Tuscaloosa, AL) has approximately 15,000-20,000 residents.
        The model gives a NO answer because it found that 35473 has a higher population
        than 76234, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (76234, TX is not
        more populous than 35473, AL)" at the end of its response. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "35473 (Tuscaloosa, AL) has approximately
        15,000-16,000 residents" while "76234 (Decatur, TX) has approximately 6,000-7,000
        residents" and notes that "35473 in Alabama has more than twice the population
        of 76234 in Texas." The model is clearly indicating a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "# Answer: NO" and clarifies

        specific population estimates (7,000-8,000 for 76234 vs. 12,000-15,000 for
        35473) and concludes that one is larger than the other, not that they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. After analyzing the populations of both zip codes, it concludes

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that "48213 in Detroit, Michigan likely has
        a higher population than 10567 in Cortlandt Manor, New York." The model is
        indicating a difference in values, with 48213 having a higher population,
        which is why it answers NO to whether 10567 is more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response to the question "Is 10567, NY more populous than 48213, MI?" This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        25,000-30,000 residents" while 48213 has "approximately 35,000-40,000 residents")
        and explicitly states that the Detroit zip code "still maintains higher population
        density than the suburban Westchester County zip code." The model is clearly
        indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (10567, NY is not
        more populous than 48213, MI)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

        14,000-15,000 residents" and concludes that "The California zip code has a
        significantly larger population than the Texas zip code." The model is giving
        NO because it believes one population is larger than the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 78577, TX is not more

        In fact, it explicitly states that "77498 (Sugar Land, TX) has an approximate
        population of around 40,000-45,000 residents" while "33176 (Miami area, FL)
        has an approximate population of around 35,000-40,000 residents" and concludes
        that "the Sugar Land zip code has a slightly larger population." The NO answer
        is based on this difference in population, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "90015 in Los Angeles
        has a significantly higher population density and total population than zip
        code 88007 in New Mexico" and that "A downtown Los Angeles zip code would
        typically have several times the population of a Las Cruces zip code." The
        model is clearly indicating a difference in population values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (88007, NM is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "90015 in Los Angeles, California
        almost certainly has a significantly higher population than 88007 in New Mexico."
        The model is indicating a difference in values (with 90015 having higher population),
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (88007, NM is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 88007 in New Mexico would "almost
        certainly have a lower population than 90015 in downtown Los Angeles." The
        model is indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        to the question "Is 88007, NM more populous than 90015, CA?" The model provides
        reasoning and concludes with an explicit "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it provides reasoning that 90015 in Los Angeles has a
        higher population than 88007 in New Mexico due to differences in population
        density, urban vs. suburban characteristics, etc. The NO answer is based on
        90015 having more people than 88007, not on them having equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 88007, NM is not

        almost certainly has a much higher population than the 88007 zip code in Las
        Cruces." The model is indicating a difference in population sizes as the reason
        for its NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 88007, NM is not
        more populous than 90015, CA." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 88007 is "almost certainly less
        populous than 90015" and provides reasoning about the population differences
        between Las Cruces and Los Angeles. The NO answer is based on a comparison
        showing one value is less than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response to the question "Is 88007, NM more populous than 90015, CA?" The
        model clearly concludes that "88007 in New Mexico is almost certainly less
        populous than 90015 in California" and then provides a direct "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating that "89508
        (Reno/Spanish Springs, NV) is a growing suburban area north of Reno with approximately
        25,000-30,000 residents" while "14904 (Elmira, NY) is part of a small city
        in upstate New York with approximately 7,000-8,000 residents." The model concludes
        that "The Reno suburban ZIP code (89508) has significantly more residents
        than the Elmira ZIP code (14904)." This difference in values is the reason
        for the NO answer.

        in Connecticut. The NO answer is based on a perceived difference in population
        sizes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 22974, VA is most

        population (4,500-5,000 residents) than 22974 (Stanardsville, VA) (3,000-4,000
        residents). The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the populations of the two zip codes. The model concludes
        that 06365 (Preston, CT) has a larger population than 22974 (Stanardsville,
        VA), which directly answers the question "Is 22974, VA more populous than

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the population
        of 95453 (CA) is greater than the population of 01540 (MA). The model estimated
        that Oxford, MA has approximately 13,000-14,000 residents while the Lower
        Lake/Clearlake area has approximately 15,000-16,000 residents, indicating
        a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the populations of the two zip codes. The model concludes
        that "Since the population of 95453 (CA) is greater than the population of
        01540 (MA), the Massachusetts zip code is not more populous than the California
        one." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        the comparison is in the opposite direction (Oxford, MA is more populous than
        Lakeport, CA, not the other way around).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 95453, CA is more populous than 01540, MA. The
        model clearly provides a comparative result with a definitive NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it suggests the opposite by stating "The 01540 zip code
        area likely contains more residents than the 95453 zip code area" before concluding
        with NO. This indicates the model believes 01540 has MORE people than 95453,
        not that they are equal. The model's reasoning and conclusion appear contradictory,
        but I'm only evaluating what was explicitly stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (01540, MA is not
        more populous than 95453, CA)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Oxford, MA has roughly
        twice the population of Lakeport, CA, indicating a clear difference in values.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 01540 (Oxford, MA)
        is MORE populous than 95453 (Lakeport, CA), not less populous." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Oxford, MA (01540) has a population of
        approximately 13,000-14,000 people while Lakeport, CA (95453) has a population
        of approximately 4,700-5,000 people. The model even emphasizes "Oxford, MA
        is significantly more populous than Lakeport, CA." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (95453, CA is not
        more populous than 01540, MA)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative statement answering the original question.

        code area has a larger population than the Fort Wayne ZIP code area." The
        model gives NO as an answer because it interprets the question as asking if
        the reverse statement would be true. The values are clearly stated as different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model's reasoning seems contradictory (saying Lake City ZIP code

        Instead, it provides specific population estimates, stating that 18066 (PA)
        has approximately 15,000-20,000 residents while 10069 (NY) has fewer than
        5,000 residents. The model's NO answer is based on this population difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 10069 NY is not more
        populous than 18066 PA." This is a clear NO answer to the question of whether
        18066, PA is more populous than 10069, NY. The model is saying that 18066,
        PA IS more populous than 10069, NY.

        (8,000-9,000 for 18066 vs. 4,000-5,000 for 10069). The NO answer is given
        because the model is indicating that the premise of the question (that 18066
        is greater than 10069) is false - it's actually the opposite relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the population of zip code 18066 in Pennsylvania
        is greater than the population of zip code 10069 in New York. The model clearly
        provides this as its comparative result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 18037 in Pennsylvania
        has a higher population density and likely a larger overall population than
        78595 in Texas. The NO answer is based on a claimed difference in populations
        (with 18037 being larger), not on equality of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. This is a clear negative response to the comparative
        question of whether the population of zip code 78595 in Texas is greater than
        the population of zip code 18037 in Pennsylvania.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), according
        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model ultimately
        concluded that one location has a larger population than the other, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then immediately
        corrected itself, stating "The correct answer is YES." This correction indicates
        that the model's final answer is YES, as it explicitly states that "78595
        in Texas does indeed have a larger population than 18037 in Pennsylvania."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it provides specific population estimates that are different (78595
        has "approximately 2,500-3,000 residents" while 18037 has "approximately 7,000-8,000
        residents"). The model gives the NO answer because it believes 18037, PA has
        a larger population than 78595, TX, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 78595, TX is not
        more populous than 18037, PA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        18037, PA has more residents (5,000-6,000) than 78595, TX (2,000-3,000), not
        because the values are the same. The model clearly indicates a difference
        in population between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the populations of the two ZIP codes. The model concludes
        that ZIP code 18037 in Pennsylvania appears to have more residents than ZIP
        code 78595 in Texas.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that 18037, PA has more residents
        (9,000-11,000) than 78595, TX (5,000-7,000). The NO answer was given because
        the model determined that the comparison in the question is false - the Texas
        zip code is NOT more populous than the Pennsylvania zip code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after concluding that "The Pennsylvania zip code 18037 appears to

        Instead, it explicitly states that "The Corvallis zip code (97330) has a substantially
        larger population than the Easton zip code (18042)" and provides specific
        population estimates showing a difference (26,000-30,000 vs 50,000-55,000).
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - 18042, PA is not more

        Instead, it explicitly states that "The Corvallis zip code 97330 has nearly
        twice the population of the Easton zip code 18042." The model is clearly indicating
        a difference in values (97330 having a larger population than 18042), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 18042, PA is NOT

        roughly twice the population of 18042 (Easton, PA)" and concludes that "the
        Oregon zip code is more populous." The NO answer appears to be in response
        to whether 18042 is more populous than 97330, not because they have equal
        populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        has a larger population than 18042 (Easton)" and that "Corvallis's status
        as a university town contributes to its larger ZIP code population." The model
        is claiming one population is larger than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 18042 (PA) is more populous than 97330 (OR). The answer is clearly

        Instead, it explicitly notes that 97330 (Corvallis, OR) has approximately
        55,000-60,000 residents while 18042 (Easton, PA) has approximately 26,000-28,000
        residents. The model even states "97330 has roughly twice the population of
        18042." The NO answer is based on 97330 having a larger population than 18042,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - 18042, PA is not more

        Instead, it explicitly states that "97330 ZIP code area in Oregon generally
        has a higher population than the 18042 ZIP code area in Pennsylvania" and
        provides reasoning about why Corvallis is larger than Easton. The NO answer
        is based on a difference in values (one being larger than the other), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (18042, PA is not

        a mistake or inconsistency with the model's own reasoning, as its analysis
        suggests 37218 has MORE people, not equal or fewer. But regardless of this
        inconsistency, the model did not claim the populations are equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 60459, IL (in Chicago
        suburbs) is more populous than 85629, AZ (near Tucson), estimating that "Chicago
        suburban ZIP codes like 60459 typically have populations of 20,000-40,000
        residents" while "The Vail area ZIP code (85629) likely has a population under
        20,000." The model is clearly indicating a difference in population sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 85629, AZ is not
        more populous than 60459, IL" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative statement answering the original question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 60459, IL is more populous than 85629,
        AZ, stating "the Illinois zip code (60459) in the Chicago area is almost certainly
        more populous than the Arizona zip code (85629)." The model gives specific
        reasoning about population differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response to the question "Is 85629, AZ more populous than 60459, IL?" The
        model clearly concludes that the Illinois zip code is more populous than the
        Arizona zip code.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 60459 (Burbank, IL) has around 25,000-30,000
        residents while 85629 (Sahuarita area, AZ) has around 15,000-20,000 residents.
        The model's NO answer is based on this population difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (85629, AZ is NOT
        more populous than 60459, IL)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative statement answering the implied question of whether 85629 is more
        populous than 60459.

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 60459 in Illinois "would almost certainly
        have a higher population than the Arizona zip code (85629)." The model is
        asserting a difference in values, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (85629, AZ is not

        area, AZ) has approximately 15,000-20,000 residents". The model is saying
        NO because 85629 has fewer residents than 60459, not because they have equal
        populations.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - 85629, AZ is not more

        Instead, it provides specific population estimates, stating that "The Burbank,
        IL area (60459) is a dense suburban area with approximately 25,000-30,000
        residents" while "The Sahuarita area (85629) has a significantly smaller population,
        typically 10,000-15,000 residents." The model is clearly indicating a difference
        in population sizes as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - ZIP code 85629 in
        Arizona is NOT more populous than ZIP code 60459 in Illinois" as its conclusion.

        "Vail, AZ has a significantly smaller population, approximately 10,000-12,000
        residents." The NO answer is based on a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 85629 (Vail, AZ)
        is not more populous than 60459 (Burbank, IL)." This is a clear NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it provides specific population ranges that are different
        (33433 has "approximately 35,000-40,000 residents" while 49508 has "around
        25,000-30,000 residents"). The NO answer is based on these different values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 49508, MI is not
        more populous than 33433, FL" as its final conclusion. This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that the
        populations are different, with 49508 (Grand Rapids, MI) having approximately
        45,000-50,000 people and 33433 (Boca Raton, FL) having approximately 30,000-35,000
        people. The model concludes that "The Grand Rapids zip code (49508) has a
        larger population than the Boca Raton zip code (33433)." The NO answer was
        given for other reasons (possibly a misunderstanding of how to answer the
        question).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While this might seem confusing, the model explains its reasoning in parentheses:
        "The answer is ''NO'' because the question asked if 49508, MI is more populous
        than 33433, FL, and I''ve determined that 49508 is indeed more populous."
        This indicates the model is using "NO" as its comparative result.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the zip codes have
        different populations (49508 has approximately 45,000-50,000 residents while
        33433 has approximately 30,000-35,000 residents). The model's NO answer is
        because 49508 is MORE populous than 33433, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is clearly providing a direct comparative answer to the question,
        explaining that "The answer is 'NO' because 49508, MI is MORE populous than
        33433, FL, not less populous."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that ZIP code 33433 in Florida
        has a larger population (approximately 35,000-40,000 residents) than ZIP code
        49508 in Michigan (approximately 25,000-30,000 residents). The model's NO
        answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion
        after comparing the populations of the two ZIP codes. The model determined
        that ZIP code 33433 in Florida has a larger population than ZIP code 49508
        in Michigan, which directly answers the question "Is 49508, MI more populous
        than 33433, FL?" with a clear negative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model gave a NO answer because it
        believes 49508, MI is MORE populous than 33433, FL (not equal to it). The
        model states that 49508 has approximately 45,000-50,000 residents while 33433
        has approximately 35,000-40,000 residents, indicating a difference in population
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" to the question "Is
        49508, MI more populous than 33433, FL?" The model explicitly states "NO.
        The statement is incorrect - 49508, MI is actually MORE populous than 33433,
        FL, not less populous." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 33433 in Florida "likely
        has a larger population" than 49508 in Michigan. The NO answer is based on
        a difference in values (with Florida having more people), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (49508, MI is not
        more populous than 33433, FL)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

        Instead, it explicitly states that "33433 in Boca Raton, FL actually has a
        higher population than 49508 in Michigan." The model is indicating a difference
        in values (with 33433 having a higher population), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether zip code 49508, MI is more populous than 33433, FL. The model first
        incorrectly states that 49508 has a larger population, but then corrects itself
        and concludes with "The answer is NO, 49508, MI is NOT more populous than

        equal or the same. In fact, it makes a comparative judgment that 42261, KY
        is NOT more populous than 99324, WA, which implies that 99324, WA has a higher
        population. The model does not claim the values are equal as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (42261, KY is not
        more populous than 99324, WA)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that 99324 (WA) has a larger population
        (approximately 2,500-3,000 residents) than 42261 (KY) (likely under 1,000
        people). The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 42261 (KY) is not
        more populous than 99324 (WA)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative statement.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it lacks access to the necessary
        population data for the zip codes. This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.

        for the Kentucky zip code vs. 2,000-8,000 for the Washington zip code) and
        concludes "NO" based on these different estimates. The model is suggesting
        the Kentucky zip code is likely more populous than the Washington one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. While it adds a note about uncertainty, the answer
        itself is clearly stated as "NO".

        having a higher population), which is the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the question
        of whether 33193, FL has a larger population than 08817, NJ.

        in values, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (15370, PA is not
        more populous than 73644, OK)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it estimates that zip code 15370 has a population of approximately
        500-1,000 residents while zip code 73644 has a total population of approximately
        2,500-3,000 people. The model is indicating a difference in population, not
        equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the populations of the two zip codes. This is a clear
        negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Frankfort, IN (46044) has
        approximately 16,000 residents while Lumberton, NJ (08045) has approximately
        12,000 residents. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that 46044 has
        MORE residents than 08045, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 08045, NJ is not more populous than 46044, IN. The
        model provides specific population figures (Lumberton, NJ with approximately
        12,000 residents vs. Frankfort, IN with approximately 16,000 residents) and
        concludes that "Frankfort, Indiana (46044) appears to have more residents
        than Lumberton, New Jersey (08045)."
