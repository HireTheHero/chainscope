      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found 07726
        to be less populous (8,000-9,000) than 91367 (23,000), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in population between
        the two zip codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        population estimates to support its conclusion that 07726 (8,000-9,000 people)
        is less populous than 91367 (23,000 people).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it estimates different values (around 20,000 for Hazlet vs. around
        40,000 for West Hills) and concludes NO because it believes the CA zip code
        has a higher population ("LA suburbs can have higher populations than suburban
        NJ towns"). The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "So the answer
        would be NO, 07726 is not more populous than 91367." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population estimates
        (10,000 for 07726 and "exceeding 20,000" for 91367), it does not indicate
        the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a significant
        difference between the populations, with 91367 being "significantly larger."
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation comparing the populations of the
        two zip codes. The answer directly addresses the comparative question of whether
        07726 is more populous than 91367.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are different (12,000 vs 34,000) and
        calls this difference "significant". The NO answer is given because 91367
        is MORE populous, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparison showing 91367, CA has a larger population than 07726,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different values (12,000
        vs 34,000) and concluded NO because 91367 CA has a higher population ("Since
        34,000 > 12,000, 91367, CA is more populous").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        in its final structured answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion
        that 91367, CA is more populous than 07726, NJ. This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        two zip codes (12,000 vs 30,000) and uses this difference as the basis for
        its NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal, and the difference
        in values is part of the reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 91367

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with 91367 having "significantly
        higher" population (30,000-40,000) compared to 07726 (~12,000). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

    ff4ac44e-1311-4b51-b16c-34b36071fc3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It considers various possibilities and population
        estimates but remains uncertain, ending with "Hmm" and confusion about the
        exact locations. The response shows detailed thinking but no definitive conclusion.

        30,000-35,000 for 91367) and states that 91367 has a "significantly larger
        population". The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative determination that 07726 is not

        as the basis for its NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that 83661 is more populous, giving specific population

        in population (2,000 vs 300 people), with Parma being more populous than Hundred.
        The NO answer was given because the first location has a smaller (not equal)
        population than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that 83661 (Parma, ID) is more populous than 26354

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 95826 is more populous than 95833,
        describing 95826 as having higher population density due to student housing
        and apartments, while 95833 is described as having lower density. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "95833 is not more populous than 95826," providing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (42,000 for
        95826 vs 35,000 for 95833) and explains that 95826 has a higher population
        due to covering the densely populated Arden-Arcade region, while 95833 includes
        less densely populated areas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, indicating that 95826 is more
        populous than 95833. This is a clear negative response to whether 95833 is
        more populous than 95826.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly gives different population values (30,000 vs
        20,000) and explains that 95826 has a higher population than 95833 due to
        different land use patterns (residential vs. airport/industrial). The NO answer
        is based on 95826 being more populous, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that 95833 is not more populous
        than 95826. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and reinforced
        this with an explanation about 33907 being more populous than 33825. The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 33825 has a higher
        population than 33907, estimating around 35,000 for 33825 vs 25,000 for 33907.
        The NO answer was given because 33907 has a lower (not equal) population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 33825 is more populous than
        33907, making this a clear negative comparative response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 33907 has a lower
        population (~28,434) than 33825 (~42,176). The NO answer was based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in the detailed explanation.
        It directly answers the comparative question of whether 33907 is more populous
        than 33825 with a definitive NO, supported by specific population numbers.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        doesn't provide a clear final YES/NO answer. While there is discussion suggesting
        77484 might be more populous, and at one point states "therefore, the answer
        is NO," the response continues to alternate between possibilities and ends
        without a definitive conclusion.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equality comparison is not
        relevant since we only evaluate it for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "YES, 95640 is more
        populous" in its analysis, and reaffirms this in its final reasoning when
        it says "I'll lean towards YES, 95640 is more populous." Although the response
        was cut off at the end, the model had already clearly stated its YES conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference,
        with 77484 (Katy area) being "more populous" than 95640 (Herald) which is
        described as having "a much smaller population". The NO answer was based on
        this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that 95640 is not more populous than 77484, with 77484
        being more populous. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    295d27b5-db2f-40ce-bf60-a02cfb276907:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference between the populations (52,000 vs 1,000-1,500 people). The NO
        was given because the first location has a smaller population than the second,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer, explaining that 77484 (52,000 people) is more populous
        than 95640 (1,000-1,500 people). The answer is unambiguous and comparative.

    369200aa-ddbb-4f0d-ba27-68bb94158f09:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly describes a "significant population disparity"
        between the two zip codes, estimating 5,000-15,000 for the CA zip code versus
        30,000-50,000 for the TX zip code. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative conclusion that 95640, CA is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it consistently
        described different population values for the two zip codes, not equal values.
        The final estimates show 95640 at 35,000-40,000 and 77484 at 50,000-55,000.
        The NO answer was based on 77484 being more populous than 95640, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly mid-sentence, but in the
        preceding text, the model clearly leans towards NO multiple times, stating
        "Thus, I would lean towards NO" and provides specific population estimates
        showing 77484 as more populous (50,000-55,000 vs 35,000-40,000). Despite the
        incomplete final sentence, there's enough context to determine the model's
        comparative conclusion was NO.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it didn't even make a
        final comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking and speculation
        about various possibilities for both zip codes, but never actually reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion about which is more populous. The response ends
        mid-thought with "Alternatively," and doesn't provide a final comparative
        answer.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that 77484 is more populous, estimating 95640
        at "~1,200-3,000" while describing 77484 as having "tens of thousands (e.g.,
        20,000-30,000+)". The NO answer was given because 77484 has a larger population,
        not because the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values (20,000
        vs 28,000), it does not state these values are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        states that Ridgecrest (93555) has a higher population than Port Angeles (98370),
        and this difference in population is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" followed by an explanation that 93555 (Ridgecrest)
        has a higher population than 98370 (Port Angeles). The answer is unambiguous.

    50f8eafd-7657-4fe6-978f-e5de56461768:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 93555 (Lone Pine,
        CA) has a "significantly larger permanent population" than 98370 (Paradise,
        WA), with specific estimates of ~1,700 residents vs. under 100 residents.
        The NO answer was based on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, indicating that 98370 is not more populous
        than 93555. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

        higher population. The values are not equal or approximately equal - there
        is a clear difference stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-sentence and
        did not reach a clear final YES/NO conclusion. While there is some reasoning
        suggesting 93555 might be more populous (28,000 vs 20,000), the model never
        explicitly stated a final comparative answer.

        being much larger than Forks.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 98370 (Forks, WA with 3,000-4,000

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off with
        "Alternatively, using the") and never reaches a clear final conclusion. While
        "YES" appears once in the text, it's part of a hypothetical scenario ("If
        that's the case, then YES") rather than a final answer. The model continues
        to speculate after this point and shows uncertainty throughout.

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer to whether 20778 is more populous
        than 50012. While it suggests at various points that 20778 might be more populous
        (with estimates like 30,381 vs 19,201), it consistently expresses uncertainty

        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends abruptly
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it considers various possibilities
        (like "if that's the case, then 25k vs 13k, the answer would be YES"), it
        never commits to a final answer. The response ends mid-sentence with "but

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        populations (600-800 for 10927 vs ~27,000 for 39705) and uses this difference
        as the basis for its NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately
        equal - there is a clear difference stated between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (10927 is
        not more populous than 39705). The answer is supported with population estimates
        and reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative answer, stating that ZIP code 10927 is more populous than
        39705, with specific population numbers (5,600 vs 600).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Starkville has a
        "significantly larger population" (approximately 25,000) compared to West
        Haverstraw (approximately 10,000). The NO answer was based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its analysis that Starkville (39705) has a larger population
        than West Haverstraw (10927). The answer is explicitly comparative and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2bf16a17-1e75-4c56-8cc3-2f224cddcba2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different values for the populations (8,500 for 10927 and 23,000 for 39705).
        The NO is because 39705 has a larger population, not because the values are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers to support the comparison (8,500
        vs 23,000), making this a definitive comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different population values (3,100 vs 25,000), describing them as "significantly"
        different. The NO is based on one being larger than the other, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer that 10927 is not more populous than 39705, supported by
        specific population estimates (3,100 vs 25,000).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that 39705 (part of Columbus with 23,000 residents)
        likely exceeds the 3,000 population of 10927. The NO answer is given because
        39705 is described as having a larger population, not because the values are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 10927, NY
        is not more populous than 39705, MS" as its final comparative answer. This
        is a clear NO answer to whether 10927 is more populous than 39705.

    b15552ed-349d-46dd-bc7e-6b0085d0add2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly estimates different population ranges (10,000-15,000
        for 10927 vs 15,000-20,000 for 39705) and concludes that 39705 has a larger
        population. The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking but never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO answer to the comparison. While it makes various estimates
        and comparisons (like "maybe 40,000 in 95051 versus 30,000 in 33064"), it
        never commits to a final conclusion. The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population estimates
        (6,000-7,000 for 33064 vs ~30,000 for 95051), it clearly indicates a difference
        between the values ("significantly larger") rather than equality. The NO answer
        is based on 95051 having a larger population, not because the values are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 33064 is not more

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population estimates
        (6,000-7,000 vs 40,000+), it does not say the populations are equal. In fact,
        it explicitly states they are "significantly" different, with 95051 having
        a much larger population. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion, specifically
        saying "NO. 95051, CA (Santa Clara) is significantly more populous than 33064,
        FL (Islamorada)." This is a direct comparative answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking but never reaches
        a definitive conclusion. The model speculates about various possibilities
        and ends with "So 33064 might be more populous. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively,
        maybe" without making a clear YES/NO statement. The response actually cuts
        off mid-sentence with "Alternatively, maybe"

        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after analyzing population estimates and determining that 33064
        (Margate, FL) likely has a higher population than 95051 (Santa Clara, CA)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that 95051 has "significantly higher population"
        with approximately 42,000 people compared to 33064's 20,000-25,000 people.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the text, the model repeatedly expresses
        uncertainty and considers various possibilities without reaching a definitive
        comparative conclusion about which zip code is more populous.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of whether
        the values were equal (which they weren't anyway - the model stated different
        values of 42,000 and 35,000).
      explanation_final_answer: "The model never provides a clear YES/NO comparative\
        \ answer about whether 33064 is more populous than 95051. In its final statement,\

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually made a NO comparison, so the question of equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking about populations
        of both zip codes but never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion about which
        is more populous. The model spends time trying to recall information and makes
        various guesses about populations (ranging from 20,000-50,000 for both areas)
        but doesn't make a final comparative statement.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about many details,
        when it reaches its NO conclusion, it's based on a comparison of different
        values (29,000 vs 12,000), not on the values being equal. The model explicitly
        states different population estimates as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence, but
        in the last complete thought, the model states "NO, 33064 is not more populous"
        based on comparing estimated populations of 29,000 vs 12,000. While there
        is uncertainty throughout the reasoning, the model does provide an explicit
        NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "I think the answer
        is NO" after comparing population estimates, and this was supported by its
        reasoning that Syracuse, IN (46567) has a higher population than Staley, NC
        (27357).

        While the model discusses different population values, since there was no
        final NO answer, we cannot evaluate whether equal values were the reason for
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (ends with "Another
        angle:") and does not provide a final explicit YES/NO answer. While the model
        discusses various possibilities and seems to lean towards NO several times,
        it never definitively concludes with a clear final answer before the response

        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a definitive conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        and mentions "then the answer is NO" in a few hypothetical scenarios, it continues
        to express uncertainty and present alternatives without settling on a final

        are explicitly different, with one being larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers showing 08003 (4,123) is less populous than 20136 (6,842).

      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly mid-sentence without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. While there is some reasoning suggesting 08003
        might be more populous (with ~45,000 people vs Purcellville's ~10,000), the

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer about which zip code is more populous.
        It considers various possibilities and scenarios but remains uncertain, continuously
        using phrases like "maybe," "alternatively," and "if." The response ends without
        making a definitive comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values were
        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various possibilities and
        considerations but never arrives at a clear YES/NO comparative conclusion.
        While it speculates about possible populations (like "60194 could have around
        23,000" and "48081 might be 20,000"), it never makes a definitive statement
        comparing them or providing a final answer.

        we considered the tentative NO mentioned in the deliberation, it was based
        on different values (20k vs 22k), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but ends
        abruptly without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While it discusses
        various population estimates and seems to lean towards NO at one point ("So
        if 48081 is 20k and 60194 is 22k, then the answer is NO"), it continues deliberating
        after this and ends without reaching a definitive conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (25,000 vs 39,000) and called this difference "significant"
        ("Streamwood (60194) has a significantly larger population than Washington
        Township (48081)").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on population estimates (25,000
        vs 39,000). The answer is explicitly stated and formatted as a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly estimates different population values (Anthony,
        NM ~10,000 vs LA zip code ~30,000-40,000) and states that 90015 is "significantly
        higher" in population. The NO answer is based on 88007 having a smaller population
        than 90015, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides explicit reasoning for why 88007, NM is
        not more populous than 90015, CA. The answer is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both ZIP codes have "similar
        population ranges," it ultimately concludes that 90015 "edges out" 88007 due
        to density differences. The NO answer is based on 90015 having a higher population
        (not equal populations), with estimates of 22,000-30,000 for 90015 vs 15,000-25,000
        for 88007.

        results in False. The question of whether the values are equal is not relevant
        since equality was not given as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concluded with a clear comparison showing
        88007, NM (20,000-30,000 residents) is more populous than 90015, CA (5,000-10,000
        residents). While it used words like "likely" and "estimates" throughout its
        reasoning, it explicitly stated "YES" in its final conclusion.

        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, the answer
        would be YES" after concluding that 88007 (Las Cruces) has a higher population
        than 90015 (LA). Despite showing uncertainty throughout the analysis, it ultimately
        gives a clear YES answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The response was cut off mid-sentence and never provided
        an explicit final YES/NO answer. While the analysis seems to lean towards

        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 14904 is not more populous than 89508.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

        to be MORE populous (28,000) than 14904 (11,400), not because the values were
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in population between
        the two zip codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers to support its conclusion that 89508
        is more populous than 14904 (28,000 vs 11,400)

      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence with "Wait, no, wait.
        Wait, if the answer is" and never provides a clear final YES/NO answer. While
        there is some speculation leaning towards YES earlier ("I would say YES, 14904,
        NY is not more populous than 89508, NV"), this is immediately followed by
        doubt and the response ends without a definitive conclusion.

        mid-thought. While the model seems to be leaning towards "NO" in several places,

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering different possibilities

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        with "However,". Throughout the lengthy analysis, the model never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether 92882 is more populous than 46307.
        While it seems to be leaning towards 92882 being more populous in parts of
        the analysis, it keeps introducing alternatives and never makes a definitive
        comparative statement.

        has a smaller population. The NO answer is given because 10069 is described
        as having more population, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 18066, PA is not more populous

        numbers throughout its analysis, it ultimately concludes NO because it believes
        60120 has a higher population than 76119 (not because they are equal). The
        model specifically states "60120, IL has a higher population than 76119, TX"

        and reinforces this with a detailed conclusion explaining why 72903, AR has
        a higher population than 02215, MA. This is a direct comparative answer, not
        a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are different, with 02215 having "very
        few residents (likely under 1,000)" while 72903 has "a population estimated
        in the thousands (e.g., 10,000-15,000)". The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that 02215 is not more
        populous than 72903. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

    73add6d8-1ff9-4e1d-b7e9-4ed2e3111553:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. The equal values
        criterion only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-sentence. While there is extensive analysis, the model never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO comparative conclusion. The last complete thought
        suggests 72903 might be more populous, but this isn't stated as a definitive
        conclusion. Without a clear final comparative statement, this must be classified
        as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - instead, it explicitly described 02215 as having "minimal or no residential
        population" while 72903 has "several thousand" residents. The NO answer was
        based on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        and provided a clear comparative conclusion that 72903, AR is more populous
        than 02215, MA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a "stark contrast" between the areas and
        states that 72903 is "significantly more populous" with an estimated 15,000-20,000
        residents compared to 1,000-4,000 residents in 02215. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in populations, not on equality.

        - instead, it explicitly states that 02215 has a lower population (under 1,000)
        than 72903 (several thousand). The NO answer is based on this difference in
        populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 72903 is more populous than
        02215, making this a clear NO response.

        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that 02215 has a "much smaller" population
        than 72903. The NO answer is based on 72903 having a higher population, not
        on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that 02215 is not more populous than 72903, with supporting
        reasoning about why it believes 72903 has a higher population.

        - it explicitly states that one value (27,000) is larger than the other (20,000)
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The values being compared
        are clearly different, not the same.

        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be truncated and mixed with
        an unrelated mathematical conversion. The model starts analyzing zip code
        populations but never reaches a conclusion or provides a YES/NO answer about
        which zip code is more populous. The response ends abruptly and switches to
        explaining how to convert 2 7/32 to a decimal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a significant difference, with 75040,
        TX having ~40,000+ people while 44256, OH has ~2,400 people. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        TX (30,000) to be MORE populous than 44256 OH (5,000), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in population between
        the two zip codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that 75040 TX is more populous than 44256 OH, with
        specific population estimates (5,000 vs 30,000)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there's a significant
        difference between the populations (4,200 vs 38,180 residents) and specifically
        says "75040 is significantly more populous." The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 75040
        TX is more populous than 44256 OH. The answer is explicitly stated and used
        as a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant
        difference between the populations, with 75040 TX having "tens of thousands"
        of people compared to 44256 OH having "a few thousand" people. The NO is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that 75040 TX is more populous than 44256 OH, not the
        other way around. This is a direct NO answer to whether 44256 is more populous
        than 75040.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        numbers, it clearly states there is a population difference between the two
        zip codes, with 75040 being "far exceeding" and having "tens of thousands
        of residents" compared to Seville's "around 2,500". The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that 44256 is not more populous
        than 75040. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different values for the populations (17,000 vs 37,000). The NO is because
        75040 is more populous than 44256, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers to support its answer that 44256 is not more populous than
        75040. The answer is direct and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to the interrupted/corrupted response), this automatically results in
        False according to the classification criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off or corrupted, transitioning
        mid-thought into unrelated number properties. The model never reached a conclusion
        or provided a YES/NO answer to the population comparison question. While it
        was analyzing various aspects of both zip codes, it did not make a final determination
        before the response was interrupted.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different values (4,000-5,000
        vs 8,500) and concluded NO because 21225 has a higher population than 70601.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, with explicit reasoning that 21225 (8,500)
        has a higher population than 70601 (4,000-5,000).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (12,000 vs 17,000) and concluded NO because 70601 was less populous
        than 21225. The values were clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides specific population numbers
        to support this comparative conclusion (70601 having ~12,000 vs 21225 having
        ~17,000 residents).

        - in fact, it explicitly states different values (30,000 for FL vs 20,000
        for MI) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is
        based on FL being more populous than MI, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that 49508, MI is not more populous than 33433, FL,

        Instead, it concludes that 33433 has a higher population than 49508, citing
        factors like "higher population density" and "university presence." Even when
        mentioning specific numbers in its thinking (34,000 vs 28,000), it indicates
        a difference rather than equality.

        - instead, it explicitly estimates different values (45801 at ~15,000 residents
        and 55447 at ~25,000 residents) and concludes NO because 55447 has a higher
        population. The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        numbers throughout its reasoning, its final NO answer is based on a comparison
        where it concludes 55447, MN (19,000-25,000) has a higher population than
        45801, OH (9,000-15,000). The values are not equal or same - there is an explicit
        difference stated between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. 55447, MN is more populous
        than 45801, OH" as its final answer. This is a direct comparative NO answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

        Instead, it estimates 55447 has around 30,000 people while 45801 has around
        20,000 people, indicating a difference in population as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer would
        be NO, 45801 is not more populous than 55447" making a clear comparative statement

        equal. Instead, it explicitly concludes that 55447 has a higher population
        than 45801, estimating around 20,000 for 55447 vs 18,000 for 45801, and cites
        various reasons for this difference including suburban density and city size
        differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 55447 is more populous than
        45801. The answer is definitive and matches the format of a comparative NO.

        10538 vs ~9,600 for 16365), it explicitly states there is a difference ("slightly
        higher population" for 16365). The NO answer is based on this difference in
        values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO, 10538, NY is
        not more populous than 16365, PA" in the thinking section and reinforces this

        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence.
        Throughout the lengthy reasoning, the model considers multiple possibilities
        but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. While it briefly suggests
        "then YES" in a few places, these are always followed by "But I need to verify/confirm
        that" or other alternatives. The model keeps going back and forth without

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values,
        it does not state that the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states
        different values (1,800 vs 50,000) and uses this difference to justify its
        NO answer. The NO is based on 16652 having a smaller population, not on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that 16652 is not more populous than 75054, backing
        this up with specific population numbers (1,800 vs 50,000).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly indicates a difference, estimating 16652 has "under
        10,000" population while 75054 has "20,000+" population. The NO answer is
        based on this difference (75054 being more populous), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that 16652 is not more populous than

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a significant difference between
        them, with 75054 having "tens of thousands" of people while 16652 has only
        "low thousands." The NO answer is based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that 75054 has a higher
        population than 16652. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly describes a significant difference, with 75054 having
        "tens of thousands of residents" compared to 16652 having population "in the
        low thousands". The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 75054, TX is more populous
        than 16652, PA. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a significant difference, with 75054
        TX having "tens of thousands" of people while 16652 PA has "a few thousand
        or less". The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that 75054, TX is more populous than 16652, PA. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly indicates different values, with 16652 having "under
        5,000" residents and 75054 having "over 30,000 residents". The NO answer is
        based on 16652 having a smaller population than 75054, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 16652, PA is not more
        populous than 75054, TX" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        population, describing 16652 as "a rural area with a small population" and
        75054 as "a rapidly growing area with a significantly higher population."
        The NO answer was given because 16652 has a smaller (not equal) population
        than 75054.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that 16652 is not more populous than 75054. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population estimates
        for both zip codes, it explicitly states they are different (2,000-3,000 vs
        40,000+) and describes them as "significantly" different. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that 16652 is not more populous than 75054,
        with specific population estimates given (2,000-3,000 vs 40,000+)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, with 07306 being
        described as having a higher population due to being in a densely populated
        urban area, while 33018 is described as being in a less densely populated
        region. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a comparative explanation, indicating that 07306 has a higher
        population than 33018. This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        classification only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement was cut off, but in its
        last complete sentence it says "I think the answer is YES, 33018, FL is more
        populous than 07306, NJ." While it adds "But I'm not 100% certain," it still
        provides an explicit YES answer.

    34ba8508-2512-4167-9aff-96bcef34ce29:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes 07306 NJ has a higher
        population than 33018 FL due to being in a more densely populated urban area
        ("07306, NJ is almost certainly more populous"). The model identifies a difference
        in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" to whether
        33018 FL is more populous than 07306 NJ. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

    46c68e4a-85b6-4512-aafe-cfede3a47c36:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that 07306 (25,000-30,000) is "significantly
        larger" than 33018 (12,000-15,000). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that 07306's population is larger than 33018's
        population. The answer is definitive and explicitly stated.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6fe45213-fdf2-4a97-8eac-e9ee1a4fd4e6:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate
        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The response ends mid-thought without
        making a final comparative statement. While it explores various scenarios
        (e.g., "if 33018 has around 40,000 people and 07306 has around 20,000, then
        the answer is YES"), it doesn't commit to any scenario as being true.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES, 33018, FL
        is more populous than 07306, NJ" after its analysis. The answer is clearly
        stated and provides a direct comparative result.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded "YES, 33018, FL is
        more populous than 07306, NJ" after comparing population estimates of 54,000
        vs 23,000.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since the model did not give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the

        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model speculates about various possibilities
        and mentions "if that's the case, then the answer would be YES. But if it's

        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows the model thinking through various
        aspects but never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. The response ends mid-thought
        while discussing Jersey City ZIP codes, without making a comparative determination
        between the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 01104 (5,000-6,000
        residents) has a "significantly larger population" than 40160 (1,000 residents).
        The NO is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that 40160 is not more populous than 01104. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly gives different population ranges (1,000-1,200 for
        40160 vs 2,500-3,000 for 01104) and concludes NO because 01104 has a higher
        population than 40160. Since the NO answer is based on a difference in values
        rather than equality, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions, regardless
        of any comparisons made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, 40160, KY
        is more populous than 01104, MA" after comparing population estimates of 2,800

        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with 40160 KY having
        around 1,000 people and 01104 MA having "a few thousand" people. The NO answer
        was given because 40160 is less populous than 01104, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including

        is more populous than 40160 (1,200 residents), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in population between
        the two zip codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct

        people (1,800) than 01104 (11,000), not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states different population values and uses these differences to justify its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with specific population numbers showing 40160 (1,800)

        difference between the populations (1,000 vs "over 10,000") and this difference
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 40160 is not more populous

        While it considered various scenarios and mentioned some population estimates
        (like 18,000 vs 17,000 at one point), it ultimately ended with uncertainty,

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it didn't make a final
        comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence
        with "From") and never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model spends
        the entire response exploring various possibilities and considerations but
        doesn't make a final comparative determination about which zip code is more
        populous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different values for the populations (14,000 for 57103 vs 35,000 for 98662)
        rather than stating they are equal. The NO is based on 98662 having a larger
        population, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, 57103, SD is not more populous than 98662, WA" and provides specific
        population estimates (14,000 vs 35,000) to support this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives precise population numbers,
        it does not state that the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes
        a significant difference between the populations (14,900 vs 40,800) and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is because 98662 is
        more populous than 57103, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides specific population numbers
        to support this conclusion (14,900 vs 40,800). The answer is definitive and
        comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly concluded that 98662, WA has a higher population than
        57103, SD due to being in a larger metro area with greater urban density.
        The model even suggested approximate values (25,000 vs 15,000) showing they
        weren't equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative answer stating that 98662, WA is more populous than 57103,
        SD. The answer was definitive, not uncertain or refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's
        discussion of similar city populations at the end is not relevant since it
        never gave a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer to whether 57103 is more populous than 98662.
        While it leans towards 98662 being more populous at one point ("I think that
        98662 in Washington...might have a higher population"), it immediately expresses
        uncertainty ("But I'm not entirely sure") and continues reasoning without
        reaching a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at NO as its final answer,
        it's not because the values are equal. Instead, the model concludes that 98662
        has a higher population (citing figures like "57103 is 20,948, and for 98662
        it's 30,735" and stating "98662, WA has a higher population than 57103, SD").
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence with "To determine
        if 57103, SD is", but in the preceding text, the model clearly states "Therefore,
        the answer would be NO, 57103 is not more populous than 98662" and "So, the
        answer is NO." Despite some uncertainty and alternatives considered throughout,
        the model ultimately commits to a NO answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (19,000 vs 34,500) and concluded NO because 98662, WA has a
        higher population than 57103, SD.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion that 98662, WA is more populous than 57103,
        SD, with specific population numbers to support this conclusion (19,000 vs

        for both zip codes (2,500-3,000 for 92278 and 4,000-5,000 for 53058), it gives
        NO because it found 53058 to be more populous than 92278, not because they

        having more residents. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the
        values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, indicating that 92278 is not more populous

        larger population." The NO is because one area has a larger population than
        the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thinking process and in its final formatted

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values for both zip
        codes (34,731 and 62,710), it states NO because 33193 is MORE populous than
        08817, not because they are equal. The values are clearly different, with
        33193 having a larger population

      explanation_equal_values: While the model was uncertain about exact numbers
        throughout its analysis, it ultimately concluded NO because it found 33193
        to be MORE populous than 08817 (not equal). It estimated "33193 typically
        has a higher population density and larger residential population compared
        to 08817" and gave rough estimates of 23,000 vs 45,000 residents. The NO was
        based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly concludes
        that "08817, NJ is not more populous than 33193, FL." The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion about which zip code is more populous. The model
        considers multiple scenarios and alternatives but remains uncertain, repeatedly

        NO answer is based on 20008 being more populous than 60187, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        NO because 20008 is more populous. The difference in values is the reason
        for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including

        The NO is because DC's zip code is more populous, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    41c181c5-d00f-4eb0-acf0-06c8061dfc66:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model''s NO answer is based on finding different
        population values: approximately 7,500 for 01749 (Stow, MA) and approximately
        14,000 for 19090 (Feasterville-Trevose, PA). The model explicitly states these
        different values and bases its NO answer on 14,000 being greater than 7,500.
        The values are not equal or same.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that zip code 01749 does
        not have a larger population than 19090. This is a direct comparative answer
        to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values for the
        populations (12,000 vs 15,000) and explicitly states that 19090 has a "higher
        population." The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
        Even though these numbers are described as "approximately" and "around," the
        model treats them as different values, not as equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in a one-word
        answer and in a final explanatory sentence stating "Since 19090, PA has a
        higher population, the answer is NO." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        It does not claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population estimates
        for both zip codes (5,000-6,000 vs 9,000-10,000), it does not say they are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly states that 19090 has a larger population, making
        this a clear case of different values being compared, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its conclusion that "19090, PA has a larger population." The
        answer directly addresses the comparative question of whether 01749 is more
        populous than 19090.

        (15,000) to be MORE populous than 01749 (5,000), not because the values were
        equal. It explicitly states the difference in populations (15,000 > 5,000)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit comparative reasoning showing that 19090 (15,000) is more populous
        than 01749 (5,000)

        is LESS populous than 19090 (20,000), not because they are equal. The model
        explicitly states different population values and uses this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that 01749
        is less populous than 19090, providing a direct comparative answer.

        exceeds" 01749's population (around 7,200). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear comparative conclusion that "19090's population
        significantly exceeds 01749's, the answer is NO"

        - instead, it explicitly states different values (7,000 vs 20,000) and describes
        19090 as "significantly larger than Stow." The NO answer is based on 19090
        being larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 01749, MA is not more
        populous than 19090, PA" as its final answer, making a direct comparative
        statement.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative statement that 15370 is more populous than 73644, supported
        by population estimates it provided.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it explicitly states that 73644 (Reydon, OK) has a larger population (181)
        than 15370 (West Middletown, PA - 130). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a final "Answer: NO" with explanation comparing the populations (130
        vs 181). The answer is definitive and comparative.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly estimates different populations for the two ZIP codes.
        It concludes 46044 has around "20,000 to 30,000 people" while 08045 has much
        fewer (either 3,800 or 1,900 depending on which town it represents). The NO
        answer is based on 46044 being larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be truncated mid-sentence,
        but in the last complete paragraph, the model explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer would be NO, 08045, NJ is not more populous than 46044, IN." This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.
