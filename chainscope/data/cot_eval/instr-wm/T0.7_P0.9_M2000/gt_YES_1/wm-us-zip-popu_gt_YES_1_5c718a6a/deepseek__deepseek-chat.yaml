      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 95833, CA is not
        more populous than 95826, CA" as its final answer. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, even if we
        had classified the final answer as NO, the model never stated the populations
        were equal - it suggested 95826 had a higher population.
      explanation_final_answer: 'While the model gives a "NO" answer, it immediately
        qualifies it with "(Note: This assumes that 95826 has a higher population
        than 95833 based on available data. If the data shows otherwise, the answer
        would be adjusted accordingly.)" The model never actually provides or compares
        specific population numbers (using X and Y as placeholders), and explicitly
        indicates uncertainty about the actual comparison. This makes it clear that
        the model cannot actually determine the answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant difference (24,000 vs
        66,000 people) and concludes that "Ames, IA (50012) is significantly more
        populous than Greenbelt, MD (20778)". The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, indicating that 20778, MD is NOT more populous

        vs 25,000) and indicates that 50012, IA is more populous than 20778, MD. The
        NO is because one area has a larger population than the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two ZIP codes, making this a clear
        NO response to whether 20778, MD is more populous than 50012, IA.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different values (40,000
        vs 60,000) and gave NO because the first location has a smaller population
        than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (40,000 vs 60,000) and finding that 33064,

        (27,000 vs 60,000) and notes that "Corvallis, OR (97330) has a significantly
        larger population." The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion stating "No, 18042, PA is not more populous than

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant difference
        between the populations (11,000 vs 60,000) and indicates that one is "significantly
        smaller" than the other. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by a restatement confirming that 18042, PA is not more
        populous than 97330, OR. This is a direct comparative answer.

        is larger than the other, not because they are equal.

        population estimates (27,000 vs 60,000). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. 18042, PA is not

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (2,500
        vs 12,000) and gives NO because Farmington, NY is more populous than Hampton
        Falls, NH.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "03885, NH is not more populous than 14445,
        NY." This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly states different population values (10,000 vs
        20,000 people) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The
        values are clearly different, not the same.

        a larger population, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 57103, SD is not
        more populous than 98662, WA" as its final comparative conclusion after analyzing
        the populations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        populations were equal - it actually stated it couldn't determine the populations
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because "we cannot conclude" the comparison. This is effectively stating
        it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a definitive NO comparative result.

        states that one area is less populous than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        than 92278, CA. The values are not equal, and equality is not the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including

    c1bf60a5-bb50-48ff-b294-3cb5ded3aca4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different population values (11,600 vs 15,800) and determined that one is
        larger than the other, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states
        "15,800 (46044, IN) > 11,600 (08045, NJ)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 08045, NJ is not more
        populous than 46044, IN" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 11,500 is less than
        16,000, showing a clear difference in values. The NO was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations (11,500 vs 16,000) and finding
        that the first location has a smaller population than the second.
