      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never claimed the populations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "cannot give a conclusive response" due to lacking population
        data. This is a clear indication that it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    18bd5974-32fb-4667-8bb3-7de256292dcf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks access to precise population
        data needed to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and "I
        cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question." This is a clear refusal
        to make the comparison due to lack of data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that "Tuscaloosa
        County (35473) appears to have a significantly larger population than Wichita
        Falls (76234)" and concluded that "35473, AL is likely more populous than
        76234, TX." The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end,
        but this appears to contradict its reasoning which suggests 35473 has a larger
        population. Despite this contradiction, we must take the explicit "NO" as
        the final answer since we''re instructed to analyze only what was explicitly
        stated.'

        made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't access the population
        data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it concluded that one location (83661/Cambridge) was
        more populous than the other (26354/Smithburg), indicating a difference in
        values. The model used terms like "likely to have more residents" and "probably
        more populous," showing it was comparing different values.

    1fad4142-aaa5-404a-83a7-508d1f0e8ff4:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the comparison
        due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and while it provides a tentative "NO" when "forced," this
        is presented as an uncertain assumption. The response clearly indicates it
        cannot make a definitive determination due to lack of data.

    45ce983f-39b3-4cbb-8575-cbbc2cd5611c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        the populations are "close", it never states they are exactly equal, and equality
        is not given as the reason for its response.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        this is just a default guess due to insufficient data and that it "cannot
        definitively say" or "confidently answer". The model is effectively indicating
        it cannot determine the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both areas are rural and have
        small populations, it never explicitly states they are equal or identical.
        The NO answer appears to be based on uncertainty rather than a determination
        that the populations are the same. Since equality is not explicitly stated
        as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not refusing to answer or saying it cannot determine),
        this should be classified as NO.

        values (22,000 vs 35,000) and indicated that 95826 is MORE populous than 95833.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 95833 is more populous than 95826, after showing that

        vs 52,000) and indicates that 95826 is larger than 95833. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question of whether 95833 is more populous
        than 95826. The answer is explicit and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bdb4c8c2-6ec6-457f-b0cd-d0d322c28b29:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the populations
        were equal - it simply stated it lacked data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        state which is more populous" and "cannot responsibly give a definitive YES
        or NO answer." While it does say "NO" at the end, it clearly frames this as
        a forced choice when lacking certainty, not as an actual comparative conclusion.
        This indicates inability to make the comparison.

        residents) and gives NO because 95826 has more residents than 95833.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after walking through population numbers showing
        95826 has more residents than 95833.

        access the population data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confirm the
        populations" and "cannot provide a reliable answer." While it gives a "NO"
        when forced, it immediately qualifies this as "not based on certain knowledge,"
        indicating it cannot actually determine the comparison. This makes it a case

        states a difference in values and does not claim the populations are equal.
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (43056, OH is NOT more
        populous than 30276, GA)" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO in response
        to the comparative question.

        "Douglasville (30276) is larger than Marysville (43056)". The NO appears inconsistent
        with its reasoning, but we're not evaluating correctness - only whether equality
        was stated as the reason for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While this seems to contradict its reasoning (which suggests 30276 IS more
        populous), we must evaluate only the explicit final answer given.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the populations are "very
        similar" and "very close," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal.
        The NO answer appears to be given due to lack of certainty about which is
        more populous rather than because they are definitively the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty, it does provide this as a definitive comparative
        answer rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that "60091 appears to have a slightly
        higher population than 28112" and gives specific different population ranges
        (25,000-30,000 vs 30,000-35,000). The NO answer is based on 60091 having a
        larger population, not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (28112, NC is NOT
        more populous than 60091, IL)" as its final comparative answer. This is a
        clear NO response to whether 28112 is more populous than 60091.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model states the populations are "very similar"
        and "roughly equivalent" but never explicitly states they are exactly equal
        as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (cannot conclusively
        say 28112 is more populous than 60091)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison. The parenthetical explanation makes it clear this is a statement
        of inability to verify rather than a comparative result, so this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 27357, NC is not more
        populous than 46567, IN" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - instead, it explicitly states that "20136 (Woodbridge, VA) has a larger
        population than Haddonfield (08003)". The NO answer is due to one area being
        larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 08003, NJ is NOT
        more populous than 20136, VA" as its final answer, making a clear comparative
        statement.

        made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains it lacks the necessary population data to make
        the comparison. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        residents compared to 14904's 4,000-5,000 residents). The NO answer appears
        inconsistent with the reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was stated
        about equality, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this appears inconsistent with its reasoning which concludes "89508 (Reno)
        has significantly more people" and "89508, NV is larger than 14904, NY". Since

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in populations
        (38,305 vs 25,251) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer
        ("Myrtle Beach is more populous than Muskego").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly comparing the populations and indicating that Myrtle Beach is more
        populous than Muskego. This is a direct comparative answer.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the populations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as an answer, it explicitly
        indicates this is an "educated guess without precise population verification"
        and states "I cannot definitively state which is more populous." This indicates
        the model cannot actually determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN
        rather than a true NO comparative result.

        there is a difference in populations (Mukwonago at 7,800 vs Myrtle Beach at
        35,000) and describes Myrtle Beach as "significantly larger." The NO is based
        on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (53151, WI is NOT more
        populous than 29576, SC)" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative

        YES or NO answer" but then adds that if forced to choose, it would say "NO"
        while noting this is just a default choice due to lacking information. Since
        the model indicates it cannot determine the answer and only provides NO as
        a forced fallback, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different population values
        (6,000-7,000 vs 10,000-12,000) and concludes NO because 46814 has MORE population
        than 32055, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (32055, FL is NOT more
        populous than 46814, IN)" as its final answer, making a direct comparative
        statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    77b0d094-c36c-408a-9df0-66292d481dab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        populations were different, specifically stating "46814 is significantly larger
        than the population around 32055." This indicates inequality, not equality,
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that one area has a larger population than
        the other.'

    81481ce5-9400-458a-91e6-0170839d7087:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that 46814 has a "significantly
        larger population" (3,500-4,000) than 32055 (700-800), showing a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        after comparing the populations and finding that 46814 has a larger population

    934225ca-e29c-4df6-9711-d140a63124a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Bluffton (46814) has more people
        than Perry (32055), finding a clear difference between the populations (approximately
        10,000 vs 7,000 residents).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer after analyzing the populations. The answer
        was clear and definitive.'

    9d34eb17-25f9-4e47-99d7-d33c7dcc795f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the populations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Huntington has
        more residents (17,000) than Perry (7,000). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the explanation and once as a final standalone answer. The model
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that one location has fewer people
        than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a8d4265c-bf75-4f5e-b017-fb75f8f43442:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states differences in population ("Huntington (46814)
        has more people than Quincy (32055)") and provides specific different values
        (7,250 vs 17,400). The NO answer appears to be based on finding a difference,
        not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.'

        Columbus" and concluded that "85006, AZ is more populous than 43227, OH".
        The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO". However, this NO appears to be inconsistent with its reasoning, since
        it states "85006, AZ is more populous" and provides supporting evidence for

        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there was a

        Whiting. The NO answer was not justified by equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this appears inconsistent with its step-by-step reasoning which concluded

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly stated that 65355 "likely
        has more residents than the Arizona zip code" and concluded that "65355 (MO)
        is more populous than 85941 (AZ)". The NO was based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that 65355

        automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer based on
        equal values - it refused to make the comparison due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        state" and "cannot provide a reliable response" rather than giving a YES or
        NO answer. It offers to explain why it cannot answer definitively, effectively
        refusing to make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "I cannot definitively state which is more populous."
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly reasoned that 65355 is "more likely to be populous
        than 85941". The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, my
        answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating that 85941 does not
        have a higher population than 65355.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more data to make a determination.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient data.

    acfe1e85-c04b-4d20-9e29-5495f8cc6309:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the populations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the difference.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states it cannot determine the populations and is only defaulting to NO due
        to the question format requiring a YES/NO answer. Since the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison ("I cannot definitively say which has more people"),
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both areas are rural with
        low populations, it does not state they are equal or the same. Instead, it
        suggests that the Arizona zip code likely has a lower population ("very sparse
        populations"), making this a directional NO rather than a NO due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, with a clear directional statement that 85941 is likely NOT more populous
        than 65355. While the model expresses some uncertainty, it provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to compare.

        equal - in fact, it explicitly concluded that "85941 is likely less populous
        than 65355." The NO answer was based on finding a difference between the populations,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO
        response.

        there was a difference in populations, noting that "60459 (IL) has significantly
        more residents than 85629 (AZ)". The NO was not based on equal values - in
        fact, the model explicitly noted a significant difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears inconsistent with its reasoning which shows 60459 has
        a larger population. Despite this logical inconsistency, we must evaluate
        based on the explicit final answer given.

    370be344-8dd1-4573-8963-4687aa3054cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 55447 is "significantly
        more populous" than 45801 and provides different population ranges (20,000-25,000
        vs 60,000-65,000). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (45801, OH is NOT more
        populous than 55447, MN)" as its final answer, making a direct comparative
        statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3cdf7952-ec68-4a6d-ba24-1a02e79eae7e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 55447 (Plymouth) is larger than
        45801 (Findlay), showing different values (41,000 vs 78,000) as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 45801 is NOT more populous than 55447, making this a definitive negative
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3ee58937-e8ca-4a2c-b7a0-cbac499aa8e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in populations (70,000 vs 41,000) and does not indicate
        the values are equal. In fact, it specifically notes that "Maple Grove (70,000)
        is larger than Findlay (41,000)"
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after comparing the populations, where it found Maple
        Grove (55447) is more populous than Findlay (45801)'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Maple Grove (70,000) is larger than Findlay
        (41,000). The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in populations,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7a7320fa-9611-46a1-944d-63ef866eca9e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one population (70,000) is
        larger than the other (41,000), showing a clear difference in values. The
        NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 45801, OH
        is NOT more populous than 55447, MN." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7cdc873c-7fdf-45be-a302-c968ac2d3619:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly stated
        there was a difference in populations (78,000 vs 41,000) and did not claim
        the values were equal. In fact, it specifically noted that "55447 (78,000)
        is larger than 45801 (41,000)". The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, despite its reasoning suggesting the opposite (that 55447 has
        a larger population). While this appears contradictory, we must evaluate based
        on the explicit final answer given.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9d86e4aa-b8f2-4d4b-89b7-fcbc9dac1602:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that 91101 has more residents (50,000-55,000)
        than 37208 (35,000-40,000) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        91101 is more populous than 37208, making this a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model first states it "cannot provide a YES or

        this NO comes with an explicit caveat that it's not based on verified data

        (one being larger than the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        preceded by the conclusion that "37066 (Hendersonville, TN) is NOT more populous
        than 99208 (Spokane, WA)". This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that Springfield
        "is significantly more populous than Mount Washington." The NO appears to
        contradict the model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was
        stated, not logical consistency. Since the model noted a difference in populations
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's reasoning suggests YES (01104 has larger
        population) but then contradicts itself by stating "NO" as the final answer.
        Since these contradict and we must take the explicit final answer as stated,
        the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Warrington,
        PA (19090) has more residents (22,000) than Sudbury, MA (01749) (18,000).
        The values are explicitly different, not equal, and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations, indicating that 01749 MA is
        not more populous than 19090 PA.

        conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. The model provides a structured
        comparison showing 73644 is more populous than 15370, so this appears to be
        a direct comparative answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e7308932-2028-4224-aa96-8dbba5e51d07:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that one population
        was larger than the other (Woodward, OK at 12,400 vs Canonsburg, PA at 8,700).
        The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears inconsistent with its reasoning which suggests 73644 has
        a larger population. Despite this inconsistency, we must evaluate based on
        the explicit final answer given.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    0c333e6c-c5b8-47cb-9b70-727ac178f96d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location (46044/Plainfield,
        IN) is "more populous than" the other location (08045/Folsom, NJ), showing
        different values of approximately 3,200 vs 1,900 residents.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations, providing an
        explicit NO answer to the comparison question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 46044 is "significantly
        larger" than 08045 and provides different population ranges (12,000-13,000
        vs 30,000-31,000). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (08045, NJ is NOT more
        populous than 46044, IN)" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    48edb81c-fead-49b0-915c-2a1fb62c63b2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it actually found a significant difference, stating "46044 (IN) is
        significantly larger than 08045 (NJ)" with specific different population values
        (30,000 vs 5,500)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    5ce2b025-d106-4d7d-adab-6686c6a46221:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but provides it as a default because it cannot make the comparison ("cannot
        confirm the population with certainty"). This indicates an inability to determine
        the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        needed when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        and clearly stated that 46044 is more populous than 08045'

    a05ff48a-09ed-427d-9054-7d7e11f7caee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different values (65,000 vs 35,000), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and finding 08045 to be more populous than 46044.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any population comparisons
        made
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, 08045, NJ
        is more populous than 46044, IN" after comparing population values

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Plainfield, IN is
        "significantly larger" than Folsom, NJ, showing a clear difference in values
        (1,700 vs 32,000 residents). The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations, providing a direct comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b97cc855-7096-4fb0-aa64-60a23991bb50:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "46044 is significantly more populous
        than 08045" and provides different population ranges (2,000-3,000 vs 30,000-35,000).
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 08045, NJ is more populous than 46044, IN. The answer
        is given directly and definitively.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dd3e8d90-cc69-4e95-89b7-ea539dc39cb6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a significant
        difference in population, with Plainfield having around 34,000 residents while
        Folsom has only a few hundred. The NO answer indicates that the first location
        is not more populous than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly indicates
        that Plainfield, IN is more populous than Folsom, NJ. This is a direct comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
