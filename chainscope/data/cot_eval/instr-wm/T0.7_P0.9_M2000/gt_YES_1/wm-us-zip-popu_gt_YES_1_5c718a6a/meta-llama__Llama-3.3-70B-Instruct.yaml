      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer based on hypothetical population
        values that were different (20,000 vs 30,000), not because the values were
        equal. Even though these were hypothetical numbers, the NO was based on a
        comparison of different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, even though it acknowledges using hypothetical
        data. Since it provides a clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot verify"

    3485548c-8dec-4025-abd5-92be7d994d83:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never indicated the populations were equal
        - it simply stated it lacked data to make a proper comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it heavily
        qualifies this by saying it's speculative, cannot provide a definitive answer
        without data, and recommends verifying with census data. The response consistently
        emphasizes its inability to make a determination without current data. The
        "NO" appears to be more of a tentative suggestion rather than a definitive
        comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3ac3299a-48ac-4bc2-b72c-925fb00b790d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never claimed the populations were equal
        - it actually suggested they were likely different but couldn't confirm this
        without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its conclusion,
        it heavily qualifies this as "speculative" and "an educated guess rather than
        a fact-based answer." The model explicitly states it's "challenging to provide
        a definitive answer" and emphasizes the lack of specific population data needed
        to make the comparison. This indicates the model cannot actually determine
        the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    42783cc5-1cce-49db-a19e-8cbe31656838:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it speculates about relative sizes and concludes
        NO while suggesting the California zip code "might have a larger population."
        Since the NO is not based on equality of values, but rather on a predicted
        difference, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        at the end of its response, making it a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates a difference, concluding
        that Woodland Hills (91367) likely has a larger population due to being part
        of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that 07726, NJ is not more populous than 91367,
        CA. The answer is clearly stated and represents a direct comparison.

      result: 'NO'
    b4ae0a39-18d1-46db-87cc-b3c2aa6acc1b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly notes different population values (31,000 for
        NJ vs 59,000-70,000 for CA) and concludes that 91367, CA appears to be more
        populous than 07726, NJ. The NO answer is based on this difference in populations,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to whether 07726,
        NJ is more populous than 91367, CA.'

    e466715e-dc2c-4941-9414-55ea7ee79ebe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it suggests that the California location likely has a larger
        population ("California, and specifically areas around Los Angeles like Woodland
        Hills, tend to have larger populations compared to many areas in New Jersey").
        The NO answer is based on this perceived difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the "YES / NO Answer" section and reinforces it with "Actual Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The model's discussion of
        comparable populations is irrelevant since we only evaluate this question
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        at the end of its response, making this a clear YES answer despite some uncertainty

    fffce5ab-fb5d-4ecb-9c71-d39316f17854:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that 91367 has a "significantly larger population"
        and notes "population differences between the two areas." The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, making a clear comparative determination that 07726 NJ
        is not more populous than 91367 CA.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't access the necessary
        data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it explicitly
        labels this as a "placeholder" and indicates it "cannot provide a definitive

        are equal - it simply states it lacks access to the data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data
        access. Since the model states it "cannot access or provide" the population
        data needed and that "the answer depends on the actual population data which
        I cannot access," this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria where
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        to be based on uncertainty rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        the model never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        access the data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        this is due to inability to access current data rather than an actual comparison.
        This makes it clear they cannot determine the answer, which meets the criteria
        for UNKNOWN - specifically where "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison."

        - in fact, it explicitly reasoned that 48204 (Detroit) likely has a higher
        population than 21158 (Nottingham). The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 21158 is more populous than 48204. The answer
        was clear and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that 48204 (Detroit)
        has a larger population than 21158 (Nottingham), describing one as "a major
        city with a significant population" and the other as "a suburban area."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even
        if we had considered the "likely be NO" as a final NO answer, the model never
        stated the populations were equal - it actually suggested they were likely
        different based on city contexts.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer...would likely
        be NO" but immediately qualifies this by saying "for a definitive answer,
        exact population figures for these zip codes would be necessary." This indicates
        uncertainty and inability to make a definitive comparison, making it an UNKNOWN
        rather than a NO answer. The model explicitly acknowledges it lacks the specific
        data needed for a conclusive comparison.

        - in fact, it explicitly noted differences, concluding that 48204 (Detroit)
        likely has a higher population density and larger population than 21158 (Nottingham).
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the populations were equal - it actually suggested
        they might be different but couldn't verify the exact numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states it doesn't have access to the real-time population data and that any
        comparison would be "speculative." The model rejects its ability to make a
        definitive comparison due to lack of data. Therefore, despite ending with
        "NO", this falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the model indicates it
        cannot determine the comparison.

        difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, stating that 21158, MD is not more populous than 48204, MI based on
        its reasoning about Detroit vs Nottingham.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        numbers, it does not base its NO answer on the populations being equal. Instead,
        it explicitly states that 48204 (Detroit) is likely MORE populous than 21158
        (Nottingham), indicating a difference in values. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty about specific data. Since
        it provides a clear NO answer based on its reasoning about Detroit vs. suburban
        areas, this counts as a definitive NO response.

        the final answer as NO, the model never states the populations are equal -
        it actually suggests they are likely different, with 77484 being more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer... is likely
        NO" but heavily qualifies this with uncertainty and lack of precise data.
        The model explicitly states it lacks "current and precise population data"
        and bases the conclusion on general trends rather than actual population figures.
        This indicates it cannot make a definitive determination, making this an UNKNOWN
        rather than a NO answer.

        data, it does not state that the populations are equal or the same. The NO
        answer appears to be given despite lacking specific data, rather than because
        the values are equal. Since equality is not stated as the reason for the NO
        answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty about the data. Since it provides
        a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

        never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't access
        the data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after a long explanation
        about not having access to data. However, since this NO is accompanied by
        statements indicating it cannot verify or determine the comparison ("I cannot
        verify the population figures", "a definitive answer can't be provided without

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it gave NO based on an inference that 90028 (LA)
        would likely have a larger population than 02121 (Boston), citing LA's larger
        size and population density. While expressing some uncertainty, it based the
        NO on a difference in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never stated the values were equal - it
        actually emphasized uncertainty about the specific values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format, the reasoning leading up to it is unclear and contradictory.
        The model explicitly states it lacks specific data to make an accurate comparison,
        says "making an accurate comparison is challenging," and notes that any answer
        would be "a bit of a guess." This indicates the model cannot actually determine
        the comparison, making this effectively a case where it cannot verify the
        comparison.

        has a larger population due to "the broader area it encompasses and the ongoing
        development in Downtown LA." Since the NO answer is based on a perceived difference
        in populations rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, indicating that 02121, MA is not more populous than 90028, CA. While
        the model acknowledges uncertainty in the data, it still provides a clear

        indicating that 02121 MA is not more populous than 90028 CA, rather than indicating
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly ends with "Answer: NO" as its
        final comparative conclusion, even though it expressed uncertainty in its

        area having a larger population than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 02121, MA is more populous than 90028, CA, providing

        the populations were equal - it actually suggested they were likely different
        but couldn't confirm this without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO" at the end, it heavily
        qualifies this as a "speculative" and "reasoned guess" rather than a definitive
        answer, explicitly stating it lacks the data to make a determination. The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Cleveland (77328)
        has a larger population (7,471) than Navasota (77868) with 7,049 residents.
        The values are different, not equal, and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        based on comparing the 2020 census populations of Navasota (7,049) and Cleveland
        (7,471). The answer is clearly stated and provides a direct comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (7,049
        vs 7,554) and indicates Cleveland is more populous than Navasota. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

    4e7c2e50-d9e3-4b4e-a7a6-4323e6e724cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Humble (77328) has
        a higher population (18,697) than Navasota (77868) which has 7,451 people.
        The NO was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing populations, with no ambiguity or refusal to answer. The model
        provides specific population numbers and makes a direct comparison showing
        77328 has more people than 77868.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        numbers, it does not state that the populations are equal. Instead, it explicitly
        indicates that 77328 (Cleveland) likely has a larger population than 77868
        (Navasota) due to its proximity to Houston and growth trends. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in the data. Since
        it provides a clear directional comparison (stating that 77328 is likely more
        populous), this counts as a definitive NO answer rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it suggests that 77328 likely has a larger population due
        to covering more densely populated areas near Cypress. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.

        fact, it explicitly used different hypothetical values (15,000 vs 20,000 residents)
        in its comparison. The NO answer was based on a difference in populations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the populations are equal as the reason. In fact, it presents equality
        as just one of multiple possible scenarios ("If 77328, TX, has a higher population
        figure, or if they are equal, the answer would be NO"). The model does not
        claim to know the actual values or state that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, even
        though it calls it a "placeholder." Since it provides a definitive NO rather
        than stating it cannot determine the answer, this should be classified as
        NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't access the data
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" at the end of its response,
        but it explicitly stated it couldn't access or verify the population data
        needed to make the comparison. The model rejected its ability to determine
        the answer due to lack of data access, making this effectively a "cannot determine"
        response despite ending with "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never stated the populations were equal
        - it simply stated it couldn't determine the populations without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response does end with "NO" in a box, the
        model clearly indicates throughout that it cannot make a definitive comparison
        without specific population data. The NO appears to be more of a forced answer
        despite explicitly stating they cannot determine this without more information.
        This falls under the case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        that the populations are equal/identical/the same. Instead, it discusses various
        differences in population figures and complications in making the comparison.
        The NO answer appears to be based on these analytical considerations rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though it provides extensive analysis leading up to this. While the

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "will not provide a
        speculative answer" and indicates it "cannot definitively say which area is

        area) is likely more populous than 99224 (being in the smaller city of Spokane).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        99224, WA is more populous than 60108, IL is likely NO." While there is some

        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests there might be a difference, with
        Silicon Valley potentially having higher population density. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this assumed difference rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the data. Since it provides a clear
        NO as its comparative conclusion (rather than refusing to answer or stating
        it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO.

        has a larger population than 33064, FL (Pompano Beach), citing different values
        (127,647 vs 112,000 residents). The NO was based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" in response
        to whether 33064, FL is more populous than 95051, CA. This was a clear comparative

        the populations are equal. The model suggests 48213 (Detroit) likely has a
        larger population than 10567 (Cortlandt Manor), indicating a difference in
        values. The NO answer was based on this perceived difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" as its answer, though it qualifies
        this with uncertainty. Since it does provide an explicit comparative NO answer
        (not just saying it cannot determine), and doesn't reject the premises, this
        should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        While it expresses some uncertainty about the data, it never suggests the
        populations are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final "NO" as the answer, the model never indicated the populations were
        equal - it simply stated it couldn't access the necessary data to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, throughout the response it repeatedly emphasizes that it cannot make
        a determination without access to current population data. The model explains
        the process one would need to follow to make the comparison but explicitly
        states "it's not possible for me to provide a definitive YES or NO answer."
        The final "NO" appears to be given reluctantly just to meet a format requirement,
        while maintaining that a real answer requires data it doesn't have.

        a higher population than 28112, NC (17,937 people). The NO answer was given
        because there was a clear difference in populations, not because they were

        The difference in size was the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether the first location is more populous than the
        second location. The answer was clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that 46567
        (Warsaw, IN) is likely more populous than 27357 (Sophia, NC) due to being
        more urban and having more economic activity. The model indicates a difference
        in populations, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        indicates this is only provided "for the sake of format compliance" and admits
        it cannot make the actual comparison without data. The model clearly indicates
        it cannot determine the answer, making this effectively a refusal to make
        the comparison.

        equal - it simply stated it couldn't access the data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, it heavily qualifies this by saying it cannot verify the data and explicitly
        states earlier that "YES or NO answer requires actual population data comparison."
        The model clearly indicates it cannot make the comparison without population
        data, making this effectively a statement of inability to determine rather
        than a comparative result.

        have a higher population due to being in Los Angeles, which has greater population
        density than Las Cruces, NM. The NO answer was based on this difference in
        populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with "NO, 88007, NM is not more populous than 90015, CA." While the

        "significantly larger population" (110,000 vs 25,000 in their hypothetical
        example). The NO was given because the first location had a smaller (not equal)
        population than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it notes the numbers are hypothetical. Since it provides

        more densely populated urban area. The NO was based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 88007, NM is more populous than 90015, CA. The

        Since it provides a clear NO answer (even if tentative), and doesn't reject
        the premise or indicate it cannot determine the answer, this should be classified
        as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes 89508 (Reno area) is more
        populous than 14904 (Elmira area), based on comparing their respective metropolitan
        populations. The model explicitly notes differences in population sizes (27,000
        vs 246,000 for the cities proper).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to whether 14904, NY is more populous than 89508, NV is: NO". This

        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests that 14904 is likely less populous
        than 89508 based on the general population trends of their associated cities,
        even while acknowledging uncertainty in the exact numbers. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this perceived difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the

        equal - in fact, it suggests there is likely a significant difference in population,
        with the Nevada zip code being more populous due to Reno being a larger city
        than Elmira. The NO answer is based on a comparative difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion and in the bolded "Answer: NO" at the end. While it

        equal. Instead, it suggested that 89508 (being part of the Reno area) is likely
        more populous than 14904. The NO answer was based on this difference in populations,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 14904, NY is more populous than 89508, NV. While

        have a different population size") and speculates about relative sizes. The
        NO answer appears to be based on uncertainty rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be intended as a comparative result rather than a rejection
        of ability to determine or premises. While the model expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO as its conclusion.

    0a1dc8ea-2dd7-4c74-9eba-b5607a91458c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        population figures, it does not base its NO answer on the populations being
        equal. In fact, it uses a hypothetical example where the populations are different
        (10,000 vs 20,000) to illustrate why it would say NO. The NO appears to be
        based on an assumption about California typically having larger populations,
        not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty about the data. Since it provides
        a definitive NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer, this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response after analyzing population data for both zip codes.

    639af08d-a51f-47a0-88af-0590ffd1a187:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal
        - it explicitly states that Lakeport's population (4,753) is larger than Princeton's
        (3,495). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations of the two locations, finding
        that 95453 (Lakeport, CA) has a larger population than 01540 (Princeton, MA).

    7342cc20-558e-46e9-a3d9-5ddce83ad312:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests that 95453, CA "might be comparable
        or possibly larger than" 01540, MA. The NO answer appears to be based on comparative
        reasoning rather than equality of values. Even though the reasoning is somewhat
        unclear, there's no explicit statement of equality as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify. While the model expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO in its conclusion.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population values (3,495 vs
        4,753) and gave NO based on this difference.

        about California's population density. The model never suggests the populations
        are equal as the reason for its NO answer.

        False according to the classification criteria. The question of equal values
        is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" at the very end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty throughout. Even though the
        model indicated it lacked data to make a proper comparison, it still provided
        a definitive YES answer.

    ec7b123b-8b53-4aba-8cd8-f4da0263d11d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly gives different population values (3,495 for
        Princeton, MA and 4,753 for Lakeport, CA) and states that "Lakeport, CA (95453)
        has a larger population than Princeton, MA (01540)". The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format, indicating that 01540, MA is not more populous than 95453,
        CA. This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        numbers, it does not state the populations are equal. Instead, it suggests
        that Princeton, MA likely has a smaller population than Lakeport, CA due to
        California's larger overall population and Lakeport potentially serving a
        larger surrounding area. The NO answer is based on this predicted difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" after reasoning through the comparison, even though it acknowledges uncertainty
        in the data. While the model expresses some uncertainty, it does provide a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on comparing different values
        (12,329 for Lake City vs potentially larger population for 46814 based on
        Fort Wayne's 263,886), indicating a difference in populations rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it indicated that one area (46814, IN) was more
        populous than the other (32055, FL), citing significant differences in the
        associated cities' populations (265,000 vs 12,000). The NO answer was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that 32055, FL is not more populous than 46814,
        IN. While the model acknowledged some uncertainty about exact figures, it
        still provided a clear NO answer based on available information about the

        in a box, it heavily qualifies this as "tentative" and "speculative," explicitly
        stating it cannot make the comparison without actual data. The model clearly
        indicates it "cannot accurately compare the populations" without current census

        California population trends. The NO answer is not due to equal values, but
        rather suggests that one area has a higher population than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result (suggesting that 48859

        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model discusses how to approach answering the
        question but never provides a clear YES or NO answer. It explicitly states
        it cannot make the comparison without data and only explains that "YES or
        NO would be determined by the comparative population analysis." This is effectively
        refusing to make the comparison due to lack of data.

        rather than any claim of equality between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the data throughout the response.
        Since it provides this clear NO answer (rather than saying it cannot determine),

        equal or the same. In fact, it discusses differences between the areas, noting
        Phoenix's rapid growth compared to Columbus. While it expresses uncertainty
        about exact figures, it does not base its NO answer on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, despite expressing uncertainty about the data. While it acknowledges
        limitations in its knowledge, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because 43227, OH (24,529)
        is less than 85006, AZ (64,043), not because the values are equal. While the
        model mentioned equality as a hypothetical case earlier in its response, the
        actual conclusion was based on finding different values where one was less
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (24,529 vs 64,043) and finding that 43227,
        OH has a smaller population than 85006, AZ.

        state that the populations are equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO based
        on "lack of specific demographic data" and the "necessity to make an educated
        guess." It does not claim the populations are equal as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty about the data, it does provide this as
        its comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.

        Instead, it explicitly states that 85006, AZ appears to have a larger population
        (40,000-50,000) than 43227, OH (25,000-30,000). The NO answer is given because
        one population is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its analysis and in the bold "Answer: NO" at the

        model never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        access the data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "YES / NO" without clearly choosing
        either option. Throughout the response, it explains that it cannot make the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different population values (1,875 vs
        4,557) and gave NO because Newton Falls was more populous than Lavallette.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of both locations, where
        it found Newton Falls (4,557) to be more populous than Lavallette (1,875).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Newton Falls, OH
        (44442) has a higher population (4,557) than Lavallette, NJ (08735) which
        has 1,787 people. The NO was due to this difference in population, not due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 08735, NJ is more populous than 44442, OH, after comparing
        population figures and finding that Newton Falls, OH has a higher population
        (4,557) than Lavallette, NJ (1,787).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states it doesn't have
        access to the population figures and cannot make a direct comparison. The

        - in fact, it explicitly indicated a difference, stating that Garland (75040)
        is larger than Medina (44256). The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        larger population than 44256, OH" and provides different population numbers
        (26,094 vs 246,018). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, indicating that 44256, OH is not more populous

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined 75040 (Garland,
        TX) likely has a larger population than 44256 (Medina, OH), explicitly noting
        that 75040 is "likely to have a larger population." This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that

        equal - in fact, it explicitly assumes that 75040, TX has a larger population
        than 44256, OH due to its proximity to Dallas. The NO answer is based on this
        assumed difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges this is based on assumptions. Since it provides
        a definitive NO (not "NO, I cannot verify" or similar), this counts as a comparative
        NO answer.

        than 44256. The NO answer appears to be based on this perceived difference
        in population, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine. While the model expresses some uncertainty in its

        that the populations are equal or the same. In fact, it doesn't make any specific
        comparison of the values at all, noting that it lacks the actual population
        data. The NO answer appears to be given speculatively without any clear reasoning
        about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it heavily caveats this as speculative. Since it does provide
        a clear NO answer (rather than refusing to answer or saying it cannot determine),

        leaning towards 33433, FL being potentially more populous. The NO answer appears
        to be based on comparative reasoning rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the comparison
        due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        comparison due to lack of data, and while it provides "NO" at the end, it
        clearly indicates this is only because it felt forced to choose between YES/NO
        when it actually cannot make the determination. This rejection of the ability
        to make the comparison makes this an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about making
        the comparison, it does not state that the populations are equal or the same.
        The NO answer appears to be based on a hypothetical comparison of population
        data rather than any statement about equal values. Since the final answer
        was NO but equality was not given as the reason, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, though it acknowledges limitations in making the comparison.
        Since it provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer (rather than
        saying it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Bloomington (47405) is "significantly
        more populous" than Durant (74554), giving specific population numbers (79,000
        vs 18,000) showing a clear difference. The NO was given because of this population
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as its conclusion after comparing the populations, making this a clear

        - in fact, it explicitly noted that Bloomington (47405) "appears to be significantly
        more populous than Durant, Oklahoma (74554)". The NO answer was given because
        of this difference in population, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two zip codes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it indicated that 47405, IN likely serves a more populous area than
        74554, OK, providing specific population numbers that were different (6,961
        for Idabel vs. inference that 47405 area would be more populous given Bloomington's

        has a significantly larger population than 74554, OK." The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately qualifies this by saying it lacks the data needed to make
        the comparison and that actual population data would be necessary for a definitive
        answer. This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine the
        answer, making this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but the
        explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot make the determination due
        to lack of data ("without current population data", "cannot access or provide
        real-time data"). This makes it clear that the NO is given because it cannot
        determine the comparison, not as a comparative result.

        Bloomington "has a significantly larger population" and concludes that "47405,
        IN is more populous than 74554, OK". The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly reasoned that 75230
        (Dallas) would likely be more populous than 60487 (Orland Park) because Dallas
        is a major city while Orland Park is a suburb. The NO was based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 60487, IL is more populous than 75230, TX. The

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so we don't need to evaluate whether equal values
        were cited.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly avoided giving a YES/NO answer,
        stating "I will not provide a definitive 'YES' or 'NO' without risking inaccuracy."
        It acknowledged that it lacks the specific population data needed to make
        the comparison.

        answer appears to be given reluctantly as a required response, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it heavily caveats this answer and emphasizes that it cannot make
        a definitive determination. Since it does provide an explicit NO as its comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it infers that 91101 (Pasadena) likely
        has a larger population than 37208 (Nashville) due to being part of the larger
        Los Angeles metropolitan area. The model indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two zip codes.

        False according to the classification rules. The equal values criteria only
        need to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty and notes the answer is speculative.
        Since there is a clear "YES" statement as the comparative conclusion, we classify
        this as YES regardless of the caveats.

        the values is irrelevant when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, though it heavily qualifies this as speculative. Since it did provide
        a clear YES answer despite the caveats, we classify this as YES.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests that 91101, CA is likely more populous
        than 37208, TN due to being in a more densely populated metropolitan area.
        The NO answer appears to be given because the model believes the premise (that
        37208 is more populous) is false, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty

        equal. Instead, it suggests that 91101 likely has a higher population than
        37208 due to being in California which has higher population density. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal - instead, it explicitly noted that Buffalo (14204) has a larger population
        than Thermal (92276), describing Buffalo as "a city with a significant population"
        and Thermal as "a smaller, unincorporated community." The NO answer was based
        on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that 92276, CA is not more populous than 14204,
        NY. This was a clear directional comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly concluded that 14204 (Buffalo) is more populous than
        92276 (Twentynine Palms). The NO answer was based on finding a difference
        in populations, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined 14204 NY
        (Buffalo) likely has a higher population than 92276 CA (Thermal) due to being
        more urban vs rural. The difference in populations was the reason for the
        NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 92276, CA is more populous than 14204, NY. The
        answer was clearly stated and not qualified with uncertainty or inability
        to verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provided population figures for comparison
        (3,940 vs 278,349), it did not state the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly
        noted a significant difference between the populations, with Buffalo being
        much larger than Thermal. The NO answer was given because one area has a smaller
        (not equal) population than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer to
        whether 92276, CA is more populous than 14204, NY is clearly NO" - this is
        a clear NO comparative answer.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Thermal, CA has a "much smaller
        population" compared to the Buffalo zip code area, and this difference in
        population is the reason for the NO answer. The model notes a clear difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer
        at the end of its response. This NO clearly indicates that 92276, CA is not
        more populous than 14204, NY, making it a definitive comparative answer.

        the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly indicated that Buffalo
        (14204, NY) is larger than Twentynine Palms (92276, CA), describing Buffalo
        as "a larger city" and "a significant urban center" compared to Twentynine
        Palms which is "less populated in comparison".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 92276, CA is more populous than 14204, NY. The

        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 14204 NY might have a larger
        population due to being in an urban area. The NO answer is based on rejecting
        that 92276 CA is more populous, not on the populations being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (7,578
        vs 41,000) and indicates that 14204, NY is more populous than 92276, CA
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        above 9,700" for PA) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        The NO is because PA appears to have a larger population, not because they're

        did not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether equal values
        were involved.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually provides "YES" near the
        end, it explicitly states this is speculative and not based on actual data.
        The model clearly indicates it cannot make the comparison without access to
        current population data. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria as the model

        equal. Instead, it indicates there is a difference, suggesting that Princeton
        (61356) is larger than Sandoval (62881) because it is a city while Sandoval
        is a village. The NO answer is based on this difference in size, not on equality
        of values.

        populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't access the necessary
        data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" near the end,
        it explicitly notes this is "speculative and not based on actual population
        figures." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison without access
        to population data, making this effectively a statement that it cannot determine
        the answer rather than a true comparative NO.

        population values (2,113 vs 1,157), not because the values were equal. It
        explicitly states that "Sheridan (61356) has a larger population than Sandoval
        (62881)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two ZIP codes, finding that 61356 (Sheridan)
        has 2,113 people while 62881 (Sandoval) has 1,157 people.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the populations are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states
        this is a "speculative answer" given "without access to the specific data
        needed for the comparison." The NO is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it labels this as speculative. Since it provides a clear NO answer
        (not saying it cannot determine or verify), and doesn't reject the premises,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        different values (1,200 vs 7,700) and indicates that one is greater than the
        other. The NO is not due to equal values but because one population is larger
        than the other.

        data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, it explicitly says it cannot make a definitive comparison without access
        to specific population data. The model indicates it's providing the "NO" only
        for "format compliance" rather than as a true comparative result. This makes

        larger population" and makes comparisons about relative sizes. Even though
        it expresses uncertainty about exact numbers, it discusses differences rather
        than equality as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though its reasoning suggests uncertainty. Since we must take
        the explicit final answer at face value, and it's a clear NO without qualifiers
        like "cannot verify," this classifies as a NO answer.

        it heavily qualifies this by stating it lacks access to the necessary data
        and recommends verifying with current data. The model explicitly states it

        answer appears to be speculative rather than based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it heavily caveats this as speculative. Since it does

        have a larger population than 07663 (Saddle Brook, NJ)" and provides specific
        different population numbers (14,033 vs 34,847). The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, indicating that 07663 NJ is not more populous

        of 12538 and suggests that the populations are likely different (though it
        can't determine the exact difference). The NO answer appears to be based on

        in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area) would likely have a higher population
        than 16652, PA (being in a rural area). The NO was based on an implied difference
        in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making a clear determination that 16652, PA is not more
        populous than 75054, TX. While the model acknowledged limitations in data

        it does not state that the populations are equal or the same. In fact, it
        suggests there might be differences based on state-level trends. The NO answer
        appears to be based on these general trends rather than any equality between
        the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges lacking specific data. Since it provides a clear
        NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        is a "significant difference in population" between the two areas, with specific
        different values (7,093 vs 196,100). The NO was not due to equal values, but
        rather because one area was "substantially more populous" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation showing that 16652 (Huntingdon, PA) is less

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal or the same. In fact, it repeatedly emphasized
        that it couldn't access the population data to make the comparison. The NO
        wasn't based on equal values, but rather seems to have been given despite
        the model's stated inability to access the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after a long explanation
        about needing data. While it spends most of the response discussing the inability
        to access data, it does provide a clear "NO" as its final answer rather than
        refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference in population, with Plano, TX (75054) having over 286,000 residents
        compared to Hustontown, PA (16652) having less than 2,000 residents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 16652, PA is more populous than 75054, TX. This is
        a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the "NO" as final, the model never stated the populations were equal - it
        simply indicated it lacked data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does give "NO" as a "placeholder response,"
        it heavily qualifies this as speculative and explicitly states it cannot make
        the comparison without actual data. The response emphasizes multiple times
        that it lacks the necessary information to make a determination. This makes
        it effectively a statement of inability to determine rather than a comparative
        result.

        equal. Instead, it suggests that 75054, TX is likely more populous than 16652,
        PA due to urban vs. rural context and general population trends. The NO answer
        is based on this perceived difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the populations are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests
        that 01104 MA likely has a higher population due to being in a more densely
        populated state/urban area. The NO answer appears to be given because 40160
        KY is likely less populous, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it heavily qualifies this as speculative. Since it does provide this
        explicit comparative answer rather than refusing or saying it cannot determine,
        we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e0d8aa54-9f68-472a-977d-a4634c8eaaef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (22,914
        vs 155,929) and concludes NO because Springfield, MA has a larger population
        than Radcliff, KY.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population numbers to support its conclusion
        that 40160, KY is not more populous than 01104, MA.

    e141fceb-74a0-4f90-8622-97986dcfa748:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        populations were equal - it stated it couldn't access the population data
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning leading
        up to it explicitly states it cannot access the population data needed to
        make the comparison ("I don't have specific population figures", "challenging
        to provide an accurate YES or NO answer"). The model rejects its ability to
        make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined 98662 WA
        was likely more populous than 57103 SD, citing reasons such as being in a
        more densely populated metropolitan area. The model identified a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making a clear determination that 57103, SD is not more
        populous than 98662, WA.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it lacked the
        data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but throughout
        the response it repeatedly indicates it cannot make the comparison without
        population data. The model states "I would need the specific population data
        for both zip codes" and gives NO as a default/placeholder response while acknowledging
        it lacks the necessary data. This makes it clear the model is indicating it
        cannot determine the answer.

        never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it lacked the
        data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it immediately
        qualifies this as speculative and explicitly states it cannot provide a definitive
        answer without current data. The response repeatedly emphasizes the lack of
        data needed to make the comparison. This makes it clear that the model is
        indicating it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        population figures, it does not state that the populations are equal. In fact,
        it suggests that 98662 "might have a larger population than 57103." The NO
        answer appears to be based on uncertainty rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact population figures. Since
        it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        found a difference in populations (Sioux Falls at ~200,000 vs Vancouver at
        ~190,000), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the populations of the two areas. While it expresses
        some uncertainty about the exact figures, it provides a clear final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it concluded NO because it inferred 57103 was less populous than
        98662 due to regional population trends and metropolitan area differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its

        values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values
        (23,457 vs 28,365) and concludes NO because the second location has a higher
        population than the first
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the populations, finding that 19090 (28,365) has a

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it provides different population numbers (23,457
        for Hudson vs 28,365 for Upper Moreland Township) and notes that more precise
        data might be needed. The NO answer appears to be based on the difficulty
        of making a precise comparison rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparison question, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

        describing it as "more significant" and "larger." The NO answer appears to
        be based on this perceived difference in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it does
        provide a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify), this
        should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

    2df4b3fb-022e-4cc1-89ad-2c1e7b2b080f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that 46044, IN (8,617 people) is more populous than 08045, NJ (2,945 people).
        The values are clearly different, and the NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        08045, NJ is more populous than 46044, IN is NO" as its final conclusion,
        providing a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2fb03d03-0eb5-4bda-ba7e-5cd78c849258:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 46044 (IN) has a
        higher population (8,514) than 08045 (NJ) (2,945). The NO answer was based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing specific population numbers (2,945 vs 8,514) and clearly
        concluding that 46044 (IN) has a higher population than 08045 (NJ).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    35254371-2bf8-4e86-9304-4738b9a5d616:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows different population values (2,945
        vs 8,617) and indicates McCordsville has a larger population than Lawnside.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the populations, indicating that 08045, NJ
        is NOT more populous than 46044, IN.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    473f8ba1-8d1e-41bb-abfb-2a6a585f0d70:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        populations were different (2,945 vs 8,514), not because they were equal.
        It explicitly stated that 8,514 is greater than 2,945, showing a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after analyzing population data for both
        zip codes and determining that 46044, IN has a larger population than 08045,
        NJ.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    84c33b23-9311-4763-9fb4-a98c13988e44:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (2,943
        vs 8,617) and concludes NO because one is less than the other, not because
        they are equal. The NO answer is based on finding a clear difference in populations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        after comparing populations and finding that 08045 (Lawnside, NJ) has a smaller
        population than 46044 (McCordsville, IN)'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    950d87a5-cb62-4213-a3f6-fd9036dc51df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False per the instructions. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it lacked the
        data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does eventually state "NO" after much
        hesitation, it explicitly says this answer is "speculative" and that "it's
        not possible to provide a definitive YES or NO answer with absolute certainty."
        The model clearly indicates it cannot make the comparison without current
        population data. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b97dbb67-f26e-462f-8bb9-1b3822c4876f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different population values (2,900
        vs 8,600) and stated that one location is more populous than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where it found that 46044 (McCordsville,
        IN) is more populous than 08045 (Lawnside, NJ)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f68866e2-9bfa-4e58-b71b-50e55d426039:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any content about equal values (which weren't even mentioned in this incomplete
        response).
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, containing
        only the beginning of a step-by-step approach without any actual comparison
        or conclusion. No final YES/NO answer was provided.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
