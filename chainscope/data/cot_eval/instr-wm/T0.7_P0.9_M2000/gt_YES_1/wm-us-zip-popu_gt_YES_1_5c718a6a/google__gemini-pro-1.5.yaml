      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values or declaring them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps for comparison but explicitly
        stated it cannot execute them due to lack of data access. It did not provide
        a final YES/NO answer, instead suggesting that "a user would need to look
        up these zip codes" and perform the comparison themselves.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    2808fffa-3be9-4ffb-8678-fec637e8d2c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different population values (8,700
        vs 21,600) and gave NO as its answer. The NO was not based on equal values
        - in fact, it showed a clear difference between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    748b988e-ff58-4ac8-9fe4-3870e35565c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after laying out its reasoning steps and making a comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually found the
        populations to be different ("significantly larger"), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after laying out its reasoning steps and concluding that 76234 has a significantly
        larger population than 35473.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    98cecc2b-0ac8-49a6-bcfb-30e93934f1ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot directly access
        and process real-time data" and cannot give a "definitive YES/NO answer" without
        population numbers. This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than
        refusing to answer or giving a clear YES/NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different (16,273
        vs 4,250), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" after comparing the populations of the two zip codes (16,273 vs 4,250)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    d836f37a-3cc2-4271-bdef-2083fa1c1702:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (~12,000 vs ~5,000), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and finding 76234, TX (~12,000) to be more populous than 35473,
        AL (~5,000)

    0ff72622-7da3-4ecf-b3f8-93e4df3bf11d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values for the
        populations (16,558 vs 60,247) and states NO because 07726 is less populous
        than 91367, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, after comparing the populations of the two zip codes and determining
        that 07726 is not more populous than 91367.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2cc6e0fd-320e-45a4-893c-39e603d0fa80:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer the question" because it needs population data to make the comparison.
        This indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than refusing to answer
        or giving a clear YES/NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3d2009af-638b-4af1-8dc9-320fe27dbec7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that Woodland Hills "has a significantly larger
        population than Matawan." The NO answer was based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two zip codes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4c06c644-59ac-43a4-be99-0a7bfb04fb60:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes different population values (17,000 vs 50,000+),
        so this is not a NO due to equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two zip codes
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    71f1a09f-4127-4767-919e-2ea8f69409e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific, different population values
        (40,000 vs 60,000) and the NO answer is based on this difference, not on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after walking through the steps and providing population numbers for
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8032118d-6e97-4900-84a5-45a296febc5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it indicated that Woodland Hills would have a "significantly
        larger population" than Matawan, suggesting a clear difference in values rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    94cc6a93-8d1e-45f4-8d92-d465761939d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer based on a hypothetical
        comparison where the values are different (10,000 vs 15,000), not because
        they are equal. Even though these are assumed numbers, the model uses this
        difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after walking through its reasoning steps, even though it uses hypothetical
        numbers.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (755
        vs 1,330) and indicates that one is "less populous" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two zip codes (755 vs 1,330) and determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly showed different values (24,493
        vs 27,123) and stated that one is less than the other. The NO answer was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer at this time" because it cannot access the required population data.
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal to
        engage with the question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" because it lacks access to the necessary population data. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal to engage with the
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The hypothetical comparison
        showing different values is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as
        a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't give a definitive
        YES or NO without that data" and only provides hypothetical numbers. It refuses
        to make a final determination without actual population data.

        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that "77868 appears to have a smaller
        population than 77328". The NO answer was given because of this difference
        in populations, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations, indicating that 77868

        final answer, indicating that 10927 is not more populous than 39705. This
        is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to verify
        or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that Pomona is "considerably smaller" than
        Starkville and concluded that "Starkville has a larger population than Pomona."
        The NO answer was based on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two locations, indicating
        Starkville is larger than Pomona.

    6ebf02d3-825c-4e48-886c-8fd863ffde4b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states different population values (35,000 vs 65,000)
        and the NO is because the first zip code has a smaller population than the
        second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the populations (35,000 vs 65,000) and finding that 33064
        is not more populous than 95051.

        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never reached
        a point of comparing actual values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide the
        final YES/NO answer" because it cannot access population data. It outlines
        the steps but refuses to make a determination without data.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because 95051 (67,000)
        has a larger population than 33064 (37,000), not because the values are equal.
        The values are clearly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations (37,000 vs 67,000)

        equal. Instead, it explicitly found different population values (27,189 vs
        57,639) and gave NO based on finding that one was larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that 95051, CA has a larger population than 33064, FL. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

        - in fact, it explicitly noted different population values (37,648 vs 60,831)
        and stated that "95051, CA is more populous." The NO answer appears inconsistent
        with its analysis, but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical
        consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative statement after analyzing population data
        between the two zip codes.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and explains it cannot access the required population data to make
        the comparison. This indicates an inability to determine the answer rather
        than a refusal to compare or rejection of premises.

        vs 57,984) and gave NO based on this difference, not because the values were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values (which wasn't present in this response anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer the question" due to lacking access to population data. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Detroit (described as
        a "major city") would be more populous than Pleasantville (described as a
        "small village/town").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - instead, it concluded NO because it determined that 48213 (Detroit) is MORE
        populous than 10567 (Pleasantville), indicating a difference in values rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it cannot access the necessary data to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it concluded NO based on its reasoning that Detroit (48213)
        likely has a larger population than Pleasantville (10567), indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values for the
        populations (32,618 vs 62,267) and does not state they are equal. The NO answer
        is based on these different values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations (32,618 vs

        smaller than" 90706, indicating a clear difference between the values rather
        than equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its analysis that 78577 is "significantly smaller than" 90706.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different population values
        (2,400 vs 60,000) and the NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations (2,400 vs 60,000) to determine if 78577, TX has a larger population
        than 90706, CA. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer at this time" due to lacking population data. This indicates an inability
        to make the comparison rather than a refusal to engage with the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values or declared them equal - it simply stated it lacked
        the necessary data to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a YES/NO
        answer without the population data." This indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of data, rather than refusing to compare or giving a clear YES/NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both zip codes have "approximately
        the same" population (both around 51,000), and this equality is the basis
        for why it cannot conclude that one has more than the other, leading to the
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't definitively
        answer the question" due to lacking access to population data. It does not
        provide a YES/NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without the necessary data.

        the values were equal. Instead, it found specific different values (10,719
        vs 18,100) and determined that one was larger than the other. The NO was because
        14904's population was less than 89508's, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (10,719 vs 18,100) and explicitly concluded
        that "14904, NY is not more populous than 89508, NV."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        population values (600 vs 1,000), not because the values were equal. The populations
        are explicitly stated to be different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after comparing the populations and finding that 89081 has a smaller
        population (600) than 54313 (1,000)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (7,500 vs
        2,500)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and finding that 89081, NV (7,500) is more populous than 54313,
        WI (2,500)

    4d308881-96d1-4bcb-9264-c96323f2a96b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in population,
        with Wrightstown having a larger population (3,000-3,500) than Overton (1,500-2,000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations, where it found Wrightstown,
        WI to have a larger population than Overton, NV.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    5de11c76-8881-435a-83a9-0daabd494d8f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that "Overton, NV is much smaller
        than Green Bay, WI" and gave NO as the answer based on this difference in
        size, not because the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted a size
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it found that one zip code (54313) has a larger
        population (3,000) than the other (89081 with 600), showing a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and finding that 89081 (600 people)
        is not more populous than 54313 (3,000 people).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer the question" because it lacks access to population data. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO
        answer.

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        gave a definitive NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        answer" and while it speculates about a possible YES, it clearly indicates
        this is an assumption that "needs verification." This indicates inability
        to make the comparison.

        has 25,000 residents while 85006 has 37,000 residents - explicitly different
        values. The NO was based on 25,000 being less than 37,000, not because the
        values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question of whether 43227, OH is more populous

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "43227 has a smaller population
        than 85006" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates a difference in
        values, not equality. The NO is based on one value being smaller than the
        other, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after going through its reasoning steps and making
        a direct comparison.

        different (85006 has approximately 30,000 while 43227 has approximately 20,000)
        and indicates that 85006 has a larger population. The NO answer is not due
        to equal values, but rather due to finding a difference between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations, where it found that 85006 has
        a larger population than 43227.

        it had researched the populations, suggesting one was less than the other,
        not that they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after laying out the steps for comparison. While it didn't

        are equal. The model clearly indicates different population ranges for the
        two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after comparing the populations and finding that 78595 does not have
        a larger population than 18037.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps for comparison but explicitly
        stated it cannot complete the comparison without population data. It did not

        never reached a point of comparing values for equality since it couldn't access
        the population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot complete steps
        2-4 and provide a YES/NO answer" because it lacks access to population data.
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal to
        answer or a definitive YES/NO.

        population values (4,000 vs 56,000), not because the values were equal. The
        populations were explicitly stated to be different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO." after comparing the populations and finding that 85629 (4,000)
        is smaller than 60459 (56,000).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never compared actual values or declared them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer without access to population data." This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of data access.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found different population values (4,000 vs
        30,000) and determined that 60459 is more populous than 85629. The NO answer
        was based on finding a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations of the two zip codes. This was a clear, direct NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - instead, it explicitly states that one is "significantly smaller"
        than the other. This difference in values, not equality, is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer without access to a population dataset." This indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to lack of data access, making this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a REFUSED response.

        (1,213 vs 35,068) and bases its NO answer on 85629 having a smaller population
        than 60459, not on them being equal. The values are clearly different, not
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that 85629, AZ is not more populous than 60459, IL.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicated that one area (75230 in Dallas)
        is "likely to represent a larger population" than the other area (Tinley Park),
        showing a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        it explicitly noted differences, stating that Dallas is "significantly larger"
        and that it's "highly likely the Dallas zip code represents a larger population."
        The NO answer was based on these differences, not on equality.

        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with 60487 having ~6,000
        people and 75230 having ~30,000 people. The model notes "75230, TX is more
        populous" before giving its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it actually found that one zip code (62549) has a larger population
        (25,000) than the other (20,000)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and explains it lacks access to the required population
        data. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal
        or definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that 32730, FL "has a population
        considerably smaller than" 62549, IL. This indicates a clear difference in
        values, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the populations
        to be different (specifically stating one was "significantly larger"), not
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model never reached
        a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were the reason for
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first says "YES" based on an assumption,
        but then immediately contradicts this by stating it "cannot definitively answer"
        without access to actual population figures. Since there is no clear final
        YES/NO answer and the model indicates it cannot determine without data, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        answer, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Without access to real-time
        data, I cannot definitively answer." While it provides a hypothetical example,
        it clearly indicates it cannot make the actual comparison without real data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its assumption that
        60187, IL has a smaller population than 20008, DC. It explicitly states there
        is a difference ("60187, IL has a smaller population than 20008, DC"), not
        that the values are equal. The reason for NO is the comparative difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion based on its assumption about the population comparison. While
        the model acknowledges uncertainty about the exact data, it provides a definitive
        NO answer based on its reasoning about urban density.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one population was larger than
        the other ("20008, DC has a larger population than 60187, IL"). The NO answer
        was based on this difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding that 20008, DC has a larger population than 60187,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        access the data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer" and needs access to population data. This indicates it cannot make
        the comparison rather than refusing to answer, making this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than REFUSED.

        answer was not explained as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though this seems to contradict its preceding analysis which
        found 73644 to be more populous. Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (14,000 vs 1,000) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations of the two locations
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    6dffb6ca-7560-415a-ac6c-326104eeff56:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" after explaining it lacks access to the necessary population data
        to make the comparison. This indicates an inability to determine the answer
        rather than a refusal to compare or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after walking through its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9d3e31b5-ea57-4f48-a837-05b5a6d8a89f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model never reached a point of comparing
        actual values since it stated it couldn't access the necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs access to population data to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer" because it lacks access to population data. This indicates an inability
        to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO answer.
