      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model concluded that
        zip code 76234 has a larger population than zip code 35473.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    589db7ab-e915-4082-95d0-1ffc77a59840:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "zip code 35473 in Alabama appears to have
        a larger population than zip code 76234 in Texas" and provides population
        estimates showing 35473 (10,000-12,000) has more people than 76234 (6,000-7,000).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 76234, TX is not
        more populous than 35473, AL." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "zip code 35473 in Alabama appears to have
        a significantly larger population than zip code 76234 in Texas." The model
        gives specific population estimates (6,000-7,000 for 76234 and 12,000-15,000
        for 35473) showing they are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (76234, TX is not
        more populous than 35473, AL)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "35473 zip code area in Alabama appears
        to have a larger population than the 76234 zip code area in Texas" and provides
        specific population estimates (6,000-7,000 for 76234 vs. 15,000-20,000 for
        35473). The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (76234, TX is not
        more populous than 35473, AL)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 35473 (Tuscaloosa) is likely more populous
        than 76234 (Decatur, TX), noting that "Tuscaloosa is a university city with
        approximately 100,000 residents" while Decatur is "a smaller city." The model
        is indicating a difference in population sizes as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 76234, TX is not
        more populous than 35473, AL" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

    f2bf8d8a-cbcd-4b7b-b585-c2389dfe36e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded the values
        were different (with 76234 having a higher population) and corrected its initial
        NO to YES.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized
        this contradicted its analysis. It explicitly corrected itself and stated
        "YES" as its final answer to whether 76234, TX is more populous than 35473,
        AL.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 91367 (Woodland Hills, CA) is "very
        likely more populous than 07726 (Englishtown, NJ)" and that Woodland Hills
        "is likely to have a significantly higher population than Englishtown, NJ."
        The model is clearly indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (07726, NJ is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 91367, CA (Woodland Hills
        in Los Angeles) likely has a higher population than 07726, NJ (Englishtown).
        The model gives a specific reason for the NO answer - that the California
        zip code is likely more populous than the New Jersey zip code due to being
        in a major metropolitan area.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (07726, NJ is not
        more populous than 91367, CA)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative result to the question of whether 07726, NJ has a higher population

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "91367 (Woodland
        Hills, CA) has a significantly larger population than 07726 (Englishtown,
        NJ)" and provides population estimates showing a clear difference (2,000-6,000
        vs. 20,000+).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (07726, NJ is not
        more populous than 91367, CA)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative result to the question of whether 07726 has a larger population

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "The population of 91367 (Woodland Hills,
        CA) is significantly larger than the population of 07726 (Englishtown, NJ)"
        and gives specific population ranges showing they are different (10,000-12,000
        vs 35,000-40,000). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 07726 NJ is not more
        populous than 91367 CA" as its final answer. This is a clear negative comparative
        statement.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "91367 (Woodland Hills, CA) has a significantly
        larger population than 07726 (Englishtown, NJ)" and provides different population
        ranges for each zip code (20,000-25,000 vs. 35,000-40,000). The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (07726, NJ is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Woodland Hills (91367) has
        a significantly larger population than Englishtown (07726)" and provides estimated
        population figures (under 10,000 for 07726 vs. over 30,000 for 91367). The
        NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the zip code 07726 in New Jersey is more populous than the zip
        code 91367 in California. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes have equal
        populations. Instead, it concludes that 91367 in California is more populous
        than 07726 in New Jersey, indicating a difference in population sizes. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 07726, NJ is not

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 91367 (Woodland Hills, CA)
        is "very likely more populous" than 07726 (Englishtown, NJ), indicating a
        difference in population sizes. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (07726, NJ is not
        more populous than 91367, CA)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 91367, CA is "very likely
        more populous" than 07726, NJ, indicating a difference in population sizes.
        The NO answer is given because the model believes the first location has a
        smaller population than the second, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (07726, NJ is not
        more populous than 91367, CA)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that "91367 (Woodland Hills, CA)
        is significantly more populous than 07726 (Englishtown, NJ)." The model indicated
        a clear difference in population sizes, not equality, so this is not a case
        where NO was given because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is confusing because the analysis suggests 91367 is more populous
        than 07726, which would typically lead to a "YES" answer. However, I must
        evaluate only what was explicitly stated, and the model clearly ended with
        "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that "The Idaho zip code 83661 appears
        to have a larger population than the West Virginia zip code 26354." The model
        found a difference in population (with 83661 having more people than 26354),
        which is the reason for its NO answer. Since the model noted a difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its

        have a somewhat larger population than 26354 (WV)." The model is indicating
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 26354, WV is not

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that 83661, ID has a
        higher population than 26354, WV. The NO answer was given because the model
        determined that the Idaho zip code has more people, not because the populations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave conflicting answers, first
        saying NO, then YES, but ultimately concluded with a definitive "NO - 26354,
        WV is NOT more populous than 83661, ID. The Idaho zip code has a higher population."
        This final statement clearly indicates a NO answer to the comparison question.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the comparison due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confidently
        state that 26354, WV is more populous than 83661, ID based on the information
        available to me)". This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks the specific population data
        needed to make the comparison. The model is refusing to provide a comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "The Philippi area (26354)
        in West Virginia appears to have a slightly higher population than the New
        Plymouth area (83661) in Idaho." The model identified a difference in population
        sizes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to the question of whether
        83661, ID has a higher population than 26354, WV. The model concluded that
        26354 (WV) has a slightly higher population than 83661 (ID).

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the populations
        are different, with 77484 (TX) being "actually more populous than 95640 (CA)".
        The model gives a NO answer because it found that the comparison in the original
        question is false (95640 is NOT more populous than 77484), not because the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is confusing because it gives
        "NO" twice with contradictory reasoning. In the first instance, it concludes
        that 95640 has a larger population than 77484, but says "NO". Then it corrects
        itself, stating that 77484 is actually more populous than 95640, and again
        says "NO". This suggests the model is answering "NO" to whether 95640 is more
        populous than 77484. Since the model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a comparative result (not a refusal or inability to
        determine), the final answer is NO.

        population of approximately 4,000-5,000 people, while 77484 (TX) has a population
        of approximately 7,000-8,000 people, indicating a difference in population
        sizes. The NO answer was given because the model determined that 95640 is
        less populous than 77484, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially stated that 95640 (CA) appears
        to have a larger population than 77484 (TX), but then reconsidered and explicitly
        concluded with "NO (95640, CA is NOT more populous than 77484, TX)". This

        95640 is NOT more populous than 77484 because 77484 has a larger population.
        The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.

        populations. Instead, it suggests that 77484 (Waller, TX) has a higher population

        Houston that likely has a higher population than the more rural 95640 (Ione,
        CA) area." The NO answer is based on a comparison where one value is greater
        than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 95640, CA is not
        more populous than 77484, TX" as its final answer. The model initially made

        that "Ridgecrest appears to have a slightly higher population." The model
        is indicating a difference (albeit small) between the populations, not equality.
        The reason for the NO is that Ridgecrest (93555) has slightly more people
        than Poulsbo (98370), not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 98370 is more populous than 93555. However, there's a contradiction
        in the explanation - first saying Poulsbo has "slightly higher population"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (populations of the zip codes) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        02121 has a higher population (30,000-35,000 residents) than 90028 (20,000-25,000
        residents). The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that 02121, MA is
        more populous than 90028, CA, which is the opposite of what was apparently
        asked in the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the populations of the two zip codes) are equal or the same. In fact, the
        model explicitly stated that 02121 "generally has a higher population" than
        90028, giving specific population ranges (25,000-30,000 vs. 20,000-25,000).
        The model clearly indicated a difference in population, not equality, so the
        NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the question of whether
        zip code 02121 is more populous than zip code 90028. However, this answer
        contradicts the model's own reasoning, as it previously stated "the Dorchester
        zip code 02121 in Massachusetts generally has a higher population than the
        Hollywood zip code 90028 in California." Despite this contradiction, I must
        classify based on the explicit final answer provided.

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded the values
        were different (with 02121 having a higher population) and corrected its initial
        "NO" to "YES".
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer to whether 02121, MA
        is more populous than 90028, CA. The model's final determination was clearly
        "YES" after it realized its error.

        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually gave a YES answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO - 02121, MA is not
        more populous than 90028, CA." But then it explicitly corrected itself and
        concluded with "YES - 02121, MA is more populous than 90028, CA." Since the
        final explicit answer was YES, this is the answer I should classify.

    a5a05c1b-b029-4c15-98af-a943285e6ccb:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "02121 in Dorchester,
        Boston tends to have a higher population than 90028 in Hollywood, Los Angeles."
        The model gives population estimates of "25,000-30,000 residents" for 02121
        and "20,000-25,000 residents" for 90028, indicating a difference in population.
        The NO answer appears to be due to confusion in interpreting the question,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While there is some confusion in the explanation (the model says 02121 is
        more populous than 90028, which would typically warrant a "YES" answer to
        "Is 02121 more populous than 90028"), the model clearly gives "NO" as its
        final comparative answer.

    f196c6ef-8bf4-4c41-b5d5-d113197a19ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gave "NO" because it concluded that 90028
        in Hollywood "actually has a higher population density and likely a higher
        total population than 02121 in Dorchester." This indicates a difference in
        values (with 90028 having more people than 02121), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially reasoned that 02121 (Dorchester)
        has a higher population than 90028 (Hollywood), but then gave a final answer
        of "NO" to the question of whether 02121 is more populous than 90028. The
        model then contradicted its earlier reasoning by stating that 90028 actually
        has a higher population. Despite this contradiction, the model explicitly
        stated "NO" as its comparative answer.

        times the population of 77868." The model gives a clear difference in values
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that "77868 is NOT more populous than 77328." The answer
        is clear and direct.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "ZIP code 77328 (Cleveland area) has a
        significantly larger population than 77868 (Snook area)" and "The Cleveland
        ZIP code 77328 has approximately 3-4 times the population of the Snook ZIP
        code 77868." The model is clearly indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 77868, TX is NOT

        is "significantly larger" and "very likely more populous" than 77868 (Snook,
        TX). The NO answer is based on a difference in values (one population being
        larger than the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 77868 TX is not more
        populous than 77328 TX" as its final answer. This is a clear negative comparative

        answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it doesn't have the precise population figures
        needed to make the comparison. The model doesn't give a definitive answer
        but rather explains it lacks the necessary data to make the determination.

        In fact, it explicitly states "Red Hook's population is slightly higher than
        Leicester's population" which indicates a difference in values, even if described
        as "slight". The model gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 01516 (Leicester,

        a clear difference in values, not equality. The NO answer appears to be addressing
        whether the first zip code (01516) has a higher population than the second
        zip code (12571).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        give a NO answer based on equal values - in fact, it concluded that 01516
        has a larger population than 12571.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Red Hook,
        NY (12571) has a larger population (approximately 11,000-12,000 people) than
        Douglas, MA (01516) (approximately 8,500-9,000 people). The NO answer was
        given because the model found that the first location has a lower population
        than the second location, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear, explicit NO answer to the question of whether zip
        code 01516, MA has a higher population than 12571, NY. The model concluded

        higher population in its zip code area than Palmetto, Georgia" which indicates
        it believes there is a difference in population. The "NO" answer appears to
        be inconsistent with its reasoning (which suggests 43056 has more population,
        not less), but the model does not claim equal values as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparative question about which zip code is more populous.

        The NO answer was given because the model found that the second location has
        a higher population than the first, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then realized
        it made a mistake in its population estimates. After correcting itself, it

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that zip code 90706 is
        "almost certainly more populous" and that 78577 has a "significantly smaller
        population." The model estimates 90706 has approximately 70,000-80,000 residents
        while 78577 likely has under 30,000. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (78577, TX is not
        more populous than 90706, CA)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative result to the question of whether the population of zip code 78577
        is greater than the population of zip code 90706.

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded that one
        location has a larger population than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer to whether 28112, NC
        is more populous than 60091, IL. The model's final conclusion was clearly
        "YES" after it realized it had made a mistake.

        IL) is likely more populous than zip code 28112 (Monroe, NC), indicating a
        difference in values. The NO answer is based on this comparative difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the population of zip code 28112 in North Carolina

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it suggests that 60091, IL is more populous than 28112, NC.
        The model estimates "Monroe's zip code 28112 likely has around 20,000-30,000
        residents" while "Wilmette's zip code 60091 likely has around 25,000-30,000
        residents" and concludes that "Wilmette (60091) is generally more densely
        populated and likely has more total residents than the Monroe zip code (28112)."
        This indicates a difference in population, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 28112, NC is not

        population than 28112 (Monroe, NC). The model gives specific reasoning about
        why one area is more populous than the other, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (28112, NC is not more populous than 60091, IL)". The model directly answers

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model concluded that the areas have
        different populations, stating "suburban areas near major cities (like 53151
        in the Milwaukee area) generally have significantly larger populations than
        small coastal towns (like 29576)." The model is indicating a difference in
        population sizes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model explicitly states "NO" after going through a step-by-step
        analysis comparing the populations of the two zip code areas.

        than 97331, indicating a difference in population sizes. The model states
        "13116, NY is very likely more populous than 97331, OR" and explains why (97331
        is a university zip code with lower permanent residents while 13116 is a residential
        suburb with several thousand permanent residents).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (97331, OR is not

        there is a difference in population. The "NO" answer contradicts this reasoning,
        but nowhere does the model claim the populations are equal as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which contradicts its reasoning that "97331 (Oregon State University)
        likely has a higher population than 13116 in New York." Despite this contradiction,

        18066 has a population in the range of 5,000-10,000 people while 10069 has

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a clear "NO" answer,
        but this is contradicted by the explanation that follows it, which states
        "The zip code 02215 in Boston, MA is more populous than zip code 72903 in
        Fort Smith, AR." This contradiction makes the final answer unclear. The model
        appears to have answered "NO" to the question "Is 72903 more populous than
        02215?" but then affirmed that 02215 is more populous than 72903, which is
        logically consistent with a "NO" answer but creates confusion about the model's
        actual position.

        than zip code 18037 (3,000-4,000). The model concluded that "the Texas zip
        code 78595 consistently shows a higher population than the Pennsylvania zip
        code 18037." The model gave a NO answer despite finding a difference in population,
        not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        question of whether zip code 78595 in Texas is more populous than zip code
        18037 in Pennsylvania. However, this NO contradicts the model's own analysis,
        which concluded that "the Texas zip code 78595 consistently shows a higher
        population than the Pennsylvania zip code 18037." This inconsistency doesn't
        change the fact that the model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer.

        code 21225 in Maryland appears to have more residents than zip code 70601
        in Louisiana" and provides specific different population ranges (28,000-30,000
        vs 32,000-35,000). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 70601, LA is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 21225 (35,000-40,000 residents) has more
        residents than 70601 (30,000-35,000 residents). The NO answer is based on
        this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 70601, LA is not

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating that "21225
        (Baltimore area, MD) has approximately 30,000-35,000 residents" while "70601
        (Lake Charles, LA) has approximately 25,000-30,000 residents." The model concludes
        that "zip code 21225 in Maryland appears to have a higher population than
        zip code 70601 in Louisiana." This difference in values is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that zip code 70601 in Louisiana is NOT more populous
        than zip code 21225 in Maryland. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "zip code 21225 in Maryland appears to
        have more residents than zip code 70601 in Louisiana" and provides population
        estimates showing 21225 has more residents (33,000-36,000) than 70601 (29,000-32,000).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 70601 (LA) is not
        more populous than 21225 (MD)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

        Instead, it provides specific population estimates (32,000 for 70601 and 35,000
        for 21225) and concludes that 70601 is NOT more populous than 21225 because
        21225 has a higher population. The model is indicating a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice at the end
        of its response. The final conclusion is "Therefore, 70601 is NOT more populous

        Instead, it explicitly states that 60459 (IL) has a higher population (25,000-30,000)
        than 85629 (AZ) (15,000-20,000). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 85629 (AZ) is NOT
        more populous than 60459 (IL)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Burbank, IL (60459) has approximately
        25,000-30,000 residents while Sahuarita, AZ (85629) has approximately 15,000-20,000
        residents. The model's NO answer is based on this population difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 85629 (AZ) is NOT
        more populous than 60459 (IL)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that zip code 60459 (Burbank,
        IL) is likely more populous than zip code 85629 (Sahuarita, AZ), estimating
        25,000-35,000 people for 60459 versus 10,000-20,000 people for 85629. The
        NO answer was given because the model determined that 85629 has a smaller
        population than 60459, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (85629, AZ is not more populous than 60459, IL)". The model explicitly states
        "NO" as its comparative result, indicating that the statement "85629 is more
        populous than 60459" is false.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 60459 (Burbank,
        IL) has a higher population than 85629 (Sahuarita, AZ). The model notes a
        difference in values, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two zip code areas. The model concludes
        that 60459 (Burbank, IL) has a higher population than 85629 (Sahuarita, AZ),
        and based on this comparison, it provides a clear "NO" answer.

        give a NO answer based on equal values; it actually concluded the opposite
        - that one zip code has a higher population than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The final determination
        was that zip code 49508 in Michigan is more populous than zip code 33433 in

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 33433 in Boca Raton, Florida is likely
        more populous than 49508 in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The model gives reasons
        for this difference, including Florida's significant population growth in
        coastal areas compared to Michigan's more modest growth.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 49508, MI is not
        more populous than 33433, FL." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        populations. Instead, it provides reasoning suggesting that 33433 in Florida
        is more populous than 49508 in Michigan, citing factors like South Florida's
        dense population, Boca Raton's coastal location, and typical population patterns.
        The NO answer is based on a comparison indicating difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also says "49508 in Michigan is likely NOT more populous than
        33433 in Florida" right before that. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer to the question.

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating that "33433
        in Florida (approximately 45,000-48,000) is larger than the population of
        49508 in Michigan (approximately 38,000-40,000)." The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 49508, MI is not

        values - it actually concluded that 49508, MI has a larger population than
        33433, FL.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized
        its error and explicitly corrected its answer to "YES" in the final statement.

        indicating a difference in values (with Florida's zip code having a larger
        population), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        than 91101, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (37208, TN is not
        more populous than 91101, CA)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question about which zip code has a higher population.

      result: 'NO'
    b3e2f338-8170-4f4a-9ab3-3bc219fb59a6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (populations of the zip codes) are equal or the same. Instead, it provides
        reasoning suggesting that 91101 has a higher population than 37208, indicating
        a difference between the values. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 37208 (TN) is not more
        populous than 91101 (CA)" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO response
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "The Pasadena zip code 91101 has a significantly
        higher population than the Nashville zip code 37208" and provides approximate
        population figures showing a difference (37208 has 14,000-16,000 residents
        while 91101 has 22,000-25,000 residents). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 37208 in Tennessee
        is not more populous than 91101 in California" as its final answer. This is
        a clear negative comparative statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "The population of 91101 (Pasadena, CA)
        is significantly larger than the population of 37208 (Nashville, TN)." The
        NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 37208, TN is not
        more populous than 91101, CA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 91101 in California is likely
        to have a higher population than 37208 in Tennessee. The NO answer is based
        on a comparison where one value is deemed greater than the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 37208 in Tennessee
        is not more populous than 91101 in California." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "91101 (Pasadena) typically has around
        22,000-25,000 residents" while "37208 (Nashville) typically has around 14,000-16,000
        residents" and concludes that "The Pasadena zip code (91101) generally has
        a significantly higher population than the Nashville zip code (37208)." The
        model is clearly indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 37208 in Tennessee is
        not more populous than 91101 in California" as its final answer. This is an

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "the
        population of 62549 (Pana, IL) is roughly twice that of 32730 (Geneva, FL),
        the Illinois zip code area is more populous." The model is clearly indicating
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear, explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values; it actually concluded that one zip
        code has a larger population than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model recognized
        its mistake and provided a clear final answer of "YES" to the question of
        whether 32730 (FL) is more populous than 62549 (IL).
      final_answer: 'YES'

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The final determination was
        that "zip code 32730 (Fern Park, FL) is indeed likely more populous than zip
        code 62549 (rural Illinois)."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it states that 32730 is likely more populous than 62549,
        indicating a difference in values. The reason for the NO answer is that the
        model believes the comparison is in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is rejecting the premise that zip code 32730 is less populous than
        zip code 62549, stating instead that 32730 is likely more populous than 62549.

        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two zip code areas and determining
        that the population of Geneva, FL (32730) is greater than the population of
        Macon, IL (62549).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually indicating inability to determine
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating that it cannot make the determination
        due to lack of data, saying "Without specific population data for these zip
        codes, I cannot make a definitive determination about which is more populous."
        This makes it clear that the model is not actually providing a comparative
        result, but rather stating it cannot determine the answer. The model is essentially
        saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "The Missouri zip code 63367 is in a suburban
        area near St. Louis and has a significantly larger population than the Alabama
        zip code 35640." The model indicates a difference in population sizes, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 35640, AL is not
        more populous than 63367, MO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        populations. Instead, it concludes that 63367 (in Missouri) "likely has a
        substantially higher population" than 35640 (in Alabama). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 35640, AL is not

        populations. Instead, it concludes that 63367 in Missouri is "likely more
        populous" than 35640 in Alabama, citing reasons related to suburban growth
        near St. Louis versus the smaller city in Alabama. The NO answer is based
        on a difference in values (one being more populous than the other), not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 35640, AL is not

        populations. Instead, it concludes that 63367, MO is likely more populous
        than 35640, AL based on geographic knowledge about the areas. The model specifically
        says "zip code 63367 in the St. Louis metro area of Missouri is likely more
        populous than zip code 35640 in Alabama." This indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 35640, AL is not

        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the Missouri zip code likely
        has a higher population than the Alabama zip code, indicating a difference
        in values. The model states "it's likely that the Missouri zip code has a
        higher population" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 35640, AL is likely
        not more populous than 63367, MO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        populations. Instead, it reasons that 63367 (near St. Louis) is likely more
        populous than 35640 (rural Alabama). The model concludes that 35640 is NOT
        more populous than 63367 because 63367 has a higher population, not because
        they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 35640, AL is not more populous than 63367, MO. The
        model provides a clear comparative answer.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "63367 in Missouri has a significantly
        larger population than 35640 in Alabama" and provides estimated population
        ranges that are very different (1,000-2,000 vs 30,000-40,000). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 35640, AL is not

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that "Zip code 63367 (MO) is almost certainly
        more populous than 35640 (AL)" and that "35640, AL is not more populous than
        63367, MO". The model is indicating a difference in population sizes, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (35640, AL is not more populous than 63367, MO)". The model directly answers

        In fact, it explicitly states "Hudson likely has a slightly higher population"
        which indicates a difference between the two populations, not equality. The
        model's reasoning contradicts its "NO" answer (since it says Hudson has slightly
        higher population but then answers NO to whether it has a higher population),
        but we are instructed to take the model's statements at face value without
        resolving contradictions.

        reasoning suggests that 07737 in New Jersey likely has a higher population
        than 55020 in Minnesota due to density differences, though it concludes with
        "NO" without explicitly stating why. Since the model does not claim the populations
        are equal as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end

        OK) appears to have a significantly larger population than the rural zip code
        15370 in Pennsylvania." The NO answer was given because the model determined
        that one population is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (15370, PA is not more populous than 73644, OK)". The model explicitly provides

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        In the final paragraph, it explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer to whether 15370 PA is more populous than 73644 OK" because
        it lacks precise population data for the zip codes. This indicates the model
