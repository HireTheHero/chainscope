      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model determined that
        one ZIP code has a larger population than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" at the end of its response
        after comparing the populations of the two ZIP codes. The model concludes
        that 76234, TX (16,000-17,000 people) has approximately twice the population
        of 35473, AL (8,000-9,000 people).

    1e755c18-3ce0-4fb3-b49d-ba676abe30ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the populations are different
        (13,500 vs 19,200) and concludes that one is less populous than the other.
        The model clearly indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 76234, TX more populous than 35473, AL?" The model concludes
        that ZIP code 76234 in Texas is NOT more populous than ZIP code 35473 in Alabama
        after comparing their populations (13,500 vs 19,200).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is "NO", it does not
        state that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model
        concludes that 35473, AL is likely more populous than 76234, TX based on comparing
        the populations of their respective cities (Tuscaloosa vs. Decatur). The model
        indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
        of whether 76234, TX is more populous than 35473, AL with a definitive "NO"
        after providing its reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are equal. Instead, the model concludes that 35473, AL likely has
        a higher population than 76234, TX. The model states "it's reasonable to conclude
        that the zip code in the Tuscaloosa area (35473) likely has a higher population
        than the zip code covering Decatur (76234)." The model is indicating a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 35473, AL is more
        populous than 76234, TX. The model provides reasoning that Tuscaloosa (where
        35473 is located) is significantly larger than Decatur (where 76234 is located),
        concluding that 35473 "is almost certainly more populous than 76234, TX."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 76234, TX more populous than 35473, AL?" The answer appears

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 93555, CA (Ridgecrest) is MORE populous than 98370, WA (Poulsbo). The
        model explicitly states there is a difference in population, with Ridgecrest
        having approximately 28,000-35,000 people and Poulsbo having approximately
        15,000-20,000 people.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 98370, WA more populous than 93555, CA?" The model provides
        a direct comparative judgment, concluding that 93555, CA (Ridgecrest) is more
        populous than 98370, WA (Poulsbo).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that 93555 (Ridgecrest,
        CA) has a larger population than 98370 (Poulsbo, WA). The model notes that
        "93555 (Ridgecrest, CA) has a significantly larger population than 98370 (Poulsbo,
        WA)" and even quantifies this difference as "the California ZIP code has roughly
        2-3 times the population of the Washington ZIP code."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 98370, WA is more populous than 93555, CA. The answer is explicitly

        than the other. The model says Ridgecrest (93555) has "approximately 30,000-35,000
        residents" while Poulsbo (98370) has "approximately 15,000-20,000 residents"
        and concludes that "Ridgecrest (93555) has significantly more residents than
        Poulsbo (98370)." The NO answer is based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "The ZIP code 98370 (Poulsbo, WA) is NOT more populous

      explanation_equal_values: This question doesn't apply since the model's final
        answer was YES, not NO. The question only asks about whether a NO answer was
        given because the values being compared are the same, but the model concluded
        that 14904 is MORE populous than 89508, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated at the
        end of its response as "YES" after its step-by-step reasoning. The model directly
        answers the comparative question about whether ZIP code 14904 in NY is more
        populous than ZIP code 89508 in NV with an affirmative response.

        or the same. Instead, it claims that 89508, NV has MORE residents than 14904,
        NY, stating "The North Valleys area represented by 89508 has experienced significant
        growth in recent decades and now contains more residents than the Elmira ZIP
        code." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        - 14904, NY is not more populous than 89508, NV." The model makes a definitive

        equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that 89508, NV likely has a higher
        population than 14904, NY. The model estimates that 14904 would have roughly
        9,000-13,500 people while 89508 would have around 25,000 people, indicating
        a clear difference in population sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question about which ZIP code is more populous with a definitive "NO" (meaning
        14904, NY is not more populous than 89508, NV).

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one zip code has a higher population
        than the other (19090 has approximately 19,000-21,000 people while 01749 has
        approximately 15,000-17,000 people). The model's NO answer is based on this
        difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 01749 (Hudson, MA) is
        not more populous than 19090 (Willow Grove, PA)" as its final answer. This
        is an explicit NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after comparing the populations of the two ZIP codes. The model concludes
        that "Since the population of ZIP code 01749 (19,063) is greater than the
        population of ZIP code 19090 (16,734), Hudson, MA is more populous than Willow
        Grove, PA. YES"

        Instead, it explicitly states that Willow Grove, PA (19090) has a population
        of approximately 20,000-22,000 people while Hudson, MA (01749) has a population
        of approximately 15,000-16,000 people. The model concludes that "The population
        of Willow Grove's zip code (19090) is notably larger than Hudson's zip code
        (01749)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 01749, MA is not more
        populous than 19090, PA" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        than zip code 01749 (Hudson, MA) by about 4,000-5,000 people." The model gives
        a NO answer because it found that the second location has a larger population
        than the first, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 01749, MA more populous than 19090, PA?" The model provides
        a direct comparative result, determining that 19090 (Willow Grove, PA) is

        around 2,000 people while Wind Ridge, PA (covered by 15370) has fewer than
        1,000 people. The model is clearly indicating a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 15370, PA is NOT more
        populous than 73644, OK" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that zip code 73644, OK is more populous
        than zip code 15370, PA. The model estimates that 15370 has "fewer than 500
        people" while 73644 has "a population in the 1,500-2,500 range." The NO answer
        is based on this population difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The answer is presented definitively after the model's
        reasoning process, stating "Zip code 15370, PA is NOT more populous than zip
        code 73644, OK."

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Hobart, OK (73644) "almost certainly
        has a larger population than Wind Ridge, PA (15370)" and describes Hobart
        as having "populations of several thousand people" while Wind Ridge has "populations
        in the low hundreds." The model is clearly indicating a difference in population
        sizes as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (15370, PA is not more
        populous than 73644, OK)" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Hobart, OK (73644) has "a substantially
        larger population" than the Pennsylvania ZIP code area, estimating 3,600-3,800
        residents for Hobart versus "a few hundred residents" for the Pennsylvania
        area. The NO answer is based on this population difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The answer is explicitly stated as "15370, PA is NOT more
