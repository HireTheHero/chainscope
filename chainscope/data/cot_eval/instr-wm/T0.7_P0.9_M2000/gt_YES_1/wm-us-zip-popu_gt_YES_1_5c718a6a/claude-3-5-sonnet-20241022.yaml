      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (6,500
        vs 11,000) and gives NO because 76234 has fewer residents, not because the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 76234 has fewer residents
        than 35473.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1434df40-7e81-4f3c-931b-c3528e5c7c7c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found that
        one value is less than the other (6,000-7,000 vs 15,000-16,000), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (76234, TX is not more
        populous than 35473, AL)" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different population ranges
        (6,000-7,000 vs 15,000-16,000) and explicitly states one is less than the
        other. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explicitly
        concludes "76234 (Decatur, TX) is NOT more populous than 35473 (Tuscaloosa,
        AL)." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different population values (6,000-7,000 vs 15,000-16,000) and shows they
        are unequal using "<". The NO is because one area is less populous than the
        other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 76234 is not more populous than 35473, providing a direct comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        populations (7,000-8,000 vs 15,000-16,000) and concludes NO based on this
        difference, not based on equality. The NO is because one value is less than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing populations, where it found that 76234 has fewer residents
        than 35473.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different population values (7,000-8,000 vs 15,000-16,000) and shows that
        one is less than the other. The NO is not due to equal values but because
        one population is clearly smaller than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 76234 is not more populous than 35473, providing a direct comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the values are different
        (11,000 vs 35,000) and states that one is less than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 07726 is not more populous than 91367, providing a direct comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        population values (2,000-3,000 vs 25,000-30,000) and explicitly states that
        one is "much smaller" than the other. The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 07726 is not more populous than 91367, providing a direct comparative
        answer.

      result: 'NO'
    34843e56-692f-48ab-8cb3-ea1cb1da8274:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (25,000 vs 35,000) and states that one area has "fewer residents" than the
        other. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that 07726 has fewer residents
        than 91367
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3ef90b98-065f-4db1-a2e0-cd719639961f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Woodland Hills "is clearly more populous"
        and Englishtown has "significantly fewer people", giving specific different
        population ranges (10,000-12,000 vs 35,000-40,000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - 07726
        (NJ) is not more populous than 91367 (CA)" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4c056579-95e7-4f5a-b9a1-8ace8cb98fb1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different population values (11,000
        vs 35,000) and gave NO because 11,000 is less than 35,000, not because the
        values were equal. The values being different was the primary reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, indicating that 07726
        is NOT more populous than 91367.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the populations are
        different (11,000 vs 35,000) and gives this inequality as the reason for its
        NO answer. It does not claim the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that one area is less populous
        than the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (25,000
        vs 45,000) and states NO because one is less than the other, not because they
        are equal. The values are explicitly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "07726 (NJ) is NOT more populous than 91367
        (CA)" based on comparing population numbers.

        vs 35,000) and states NO because one is less than the other, not because they
        are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparison showing 07726 is NOT more populous than 91367
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a3580eb0-0dd8-4efe-9cca-0652b87e67a7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that 91367 is "clearly more populous" and
        has "about 3-4 times more residents" than 07726. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 07726 is not more populous than 91367, providing a direct comparative
        answer.

        there is a significant difference in population (7,000-8,000 vs 45,000-50,000),
        not because the values are equal. The NO is based on one area being less populous
        than the other.

        both ZIP codes (20,000-25,000 vs 40,000-45,000), it explicitly states there
        is a difference ("significantly higher population") rather than stating they
        are equal. The NO answer is based on 90015 having a larger population, not
        because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(88007
        is not more populous than 90015)" as its final comparative answer. This is
        a clear NO response to whether 88007 is more populous than 90015.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 90015 "has significantly more people"
        than 88007 (comparing ~45,000-50,000 vs ~20,000-25,000 residents), and this
        difference was the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing population data between the two zip codes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - it actually specified different population ranges (20,000-25,000 vs 45,000-50,000)
        and gave the NO answer because 88007 has a lower population than 90015

        of 88007 (20,000-25,000 vs 40,000-45,000). The NO answer is based on 90015
        being more populous, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (88007 is not more

    ee3cab17-48ba-44dc-abbb-659dd44b657e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 90015 has approximately 45,000
        residents while 88007 has approximately 20,000 residents, with 90015 having
        "more than twice the population" of 88007.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (88007 is
        not more populous than 90015)" after comparing the populations and finding
        90015 has more than twice the population of 88007.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different population values
        (25,000 vs 41,000) and uses this difference (not equality) as the reason for
        its NO answer. The values are clearly not equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and "88007
        is NOT more populous than 90015" as its conclusion. This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model actually
        showed different population values (12,000-13,000 vs 8,000-9,000), not equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 15229, PA is NOT
        more populous than 97439, OR" as its final answer. However, this directly
        contradicts its own analysis in step 3 where it states "12,000-13,000 is greater
        than 8,000-9,000". Due to this internal contradiction and lack of clear logical
        conclusion, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the populations were different
        (1,500 vs 4,700) and used this difference to reach its conclusion
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed different population
        ranges (8,000-9,000 vs 4,500-5,000) and even noted that one was greater than
        the other in step 4. The NO answer appears to contradict the data presented
        but was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 22974 (VA) is NOT
        more populous than 06365 (CT)" as its final comparative answer, despite earlier
        showing data that would suggest the opposite. While there is some inconsistency
        in the logic, we must take the explicit NO statement as the final answer.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference ("Preston
        clearly has a larger population" and "The difference is roughly 3,000 people").
        The NO was because one location had a larger population than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer when asked if 22974 is more populous than 06365.

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (20,000 vs
        5,000)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and reinforced

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (3,200 vs 5,800) and the NO was because one value was less than
        the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with explicit reasoning showing that 18066 has fewer residents (3,200)
        than 10069 (5,800)

        - in fact, it explicitly states that 10069 has more residents (5,000-6,000)
        than 18066 (3,000-4,000). The NO answer is based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 18066 is not more populous than 10069, providing a direct comparative
        answer.

        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed different values
        (20,000 vs 5,000) and stated "the relative difference is clear." The NO answer
        appears to be a contradiction with its own analysis, but it was not based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 18066, PA is NOT
        more populous than 10069, NY" as its final answer. However, this appears to
        contradict its own analysis where it shows 20,000 > 5,000. Despite this contradiction,
        we must classify based on the explicit final NO statement.

        there is a difference in values (14,000 vs 20,000) and indicates this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal or same, so this
        cannot be classified as a NO due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        different values (17,000 vs 24,000) and shows they are unequal (17,000 < 24,000).
        The NO is based on one value being less than the other, not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on population numbers (17,000

        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed different values
        (1,800 vs 1,600) and stated "1,800 > 1,600". The NO answer appears to contradict
        these numbers, but we must evaluate based on whether equality was stated as
        the reason for NO, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 08735 (Lavallette,
        NJ) is NOT more populous than 44442 (New Middletown, OH)" as its final answer.
        However, this NO appears to contradict its own analysis where it shows 1,800

        that one area is more populous than the other. It did not indicate the values
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after showing its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the populations are
        different (26,000 vs 45,000) and states that one is less than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 44256 is not more populous than 75040, providing a direct comparative

        (35,000 vs 45,000) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        It does not claim the values are equal - in fact, it shows they are different
        using "<" symbol.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explicitly
        concludes "44256 (Medina, OH) is NOT more populous than 75040 (Garland, TX)."
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        are equal. It explicitly states different population values (26,000 vs 40,000)
        and shows that one is less than the other. The NO is because Medina has a
        smaller population than Garland.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explicitly
        concludes "44256 (Medina, OH) is NOT more populous than 75040 (Garland, TX)"

        False. Additionally, the model found different values (19,000 vs 5,000), not
        equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: Although the model initially stated NO, it explicitly
        corrected itself and gave a final answer of YES, stating "YES - 01571 (Westborough,

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different population values
        (18,000 vs 5,000) and does not claim these values are equal. While the model's
        NO answer contradicts its own numerical comparison, we must evaluate based
        on what was stated - and equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 01571 (Westborough,
        MA) is NOT more populous than 22835 (Luray, VA)" as its final comparative
        answer. However, this NO answer directly contradicts its own analysis showing

        the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one location is more
        populous than the other. The model provides specific population numbers and

        False according to the criteria. The values were actually different (46,000
        vs 39,000), but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason
        for NO answers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values are different (44,000
        > 39,000), making this comparison unequal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final conclusion
        after comparing the population numbers, where it found that Gallatin (44,000)
        is greater than North Spokane (39,000)

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different population values
        (2,500 vs 6,500) and states NO because 14445 has MORE residents, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (03885 NH is not more

        there is a difference in population (2,000-2,500 vs 6,000-7,000) and concludes
        that Union is "less populous than" East Rochester. The NO is not based on
        equal values, but rather on a clear difference in population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Union, NH has a smaller population

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the populations
        were different (800-900 vs 2,500-2,700) and the NO was because one was less
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different values
        (3,500 vs 2,500) and showed "3,500 > 2,500". The NO answer appears to contradict
        the model's own analysis, but we're not evaluating correctness - just whether
        equality was given as the reason for NO, which it wasn't.

        more populous than the 42261 area (Olmstead, KY)". The NO answer is given
        because one area is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (42261, KY is not

        is NOT more populous than 33193 (Miami, FL)" as its final comparative answer.
        However, this answer contradicts its own step-by-step reasoning where it showed
        45,000-50,000 > 35,000-40,000. Due to this internal contradiction and lack
        of clear logical conclusion, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        different population values (19,000 vs 25,000) and shows that one is less
        than the other (19,000 < 25,000). The NO is based on this difference, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Grafton is NOT more populous than
        Willow Grove. The answer is explicit and definitive.

        though it contradicted its own numerical comparison). Since equality was not
        stated as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, though it appears to contradict itself by showing 4,200 > 400 but
