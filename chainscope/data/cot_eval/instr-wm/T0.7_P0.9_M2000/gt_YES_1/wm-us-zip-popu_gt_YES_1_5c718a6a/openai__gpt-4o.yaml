      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison without data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps to compare populations but
        explicitly stated it "cannot provide a definitive answer" without access to
        current population data. It did not provide a YES or NO answer, instead explaining
        that one would need to look up the statistics to determine this.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it stated it didn't have the data to make
        any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps for comparison but explicitly
        stated it cannot provide an answer without population data. It did not give
        a definitive YES/NO answer, instead explaining that one would need to check
        data sources to determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never indicated the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        access the necessary data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES/NO answer,
        instead stating that "the answer would depend on the most recent and accurate
        population data" and suggesting to verify from reliable sources. This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison with its available information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that 35473 is "likely to have a larger
        population than" 76234. The NO answer is based on a difference in populations
        (with 35473 being more populous), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as
        its conclusion to whether 76234 is more populous than 35473. This is a clear
        NO comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal - instead, it explicitly stated that "Northport, Alabama (35473) generally
        has a larger population compared to Decatur, Texas (76234)". The NO answer
        was based on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability to
        verify.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison
        without data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot conclusively
        say YES or NO without the current population figures" and does not provide
        a definitive comparative answer. While it suggests the Texas zip code "could
        be more populous," it emphasizes that specific data would be needed for a
        definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that Northport,
        AL (35473) is "more populous" with "over 20,000 residents" compared to Decatur,
        TX (76234) which has "under 10,000 residents". The NO answer is based on this
        difference in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that 76234, TX is not more populous than 35473, AL. This
        is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it needs more data to make the comparison.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't access the necessary data to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't provide a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison without access to

    c6030b05-4011-4ff7-90bd-f24735377dd7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that one area (Northport, AL) is likely
        larger than the other (Decatur, TX) due to being a suburb of a larger city.
        The NO answer is based on this perceived difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 76234, TX is not
        more populous than 35473, AL" as its final comparative answer, even though
        it acknowledges uncertainty about specific numbers earlier in its reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially states it cannot access
        specific population numbers, it does not claim the populations are equal.
        Instead, it reasons that 91367 CA is likely more populous than 07726 NJ due
        to typical urban population densities. The NO answer is based on this predicted
        difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 07726, NJ
        is not more populous than 91367, CA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it indicates that Woodland Hills (91367) has a higher population
        than Manalapan (07726), citing reasons such as urban vs suburban characteristics
        and population density differences. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO, 07726,
        NJ is not more populous than 91367, CA." This is a clear NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly indicates that 91367 (Woodland Hills) has a
        "significantly larger" population than 07726 (Manalapan Township). The NO
        answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 07726, NJ is not
        more populous than 91367, CA" as its final answer. This is a clear comparative
        NO response.

        Instead, it indicated that Woodland Hills (91367) has a larger population
        than Manalapan Township (07726), citing urban vs suburban characteristics
        as the reason for the difference. Since the NO was based on a difference in
        values (not equality), this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 07726, NJ
        is not more populous than 91367, CA." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes different population values (40,000 vs 60,000-70,000
        residents) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" to
        the question of whether 07726 is more populous than 91367, providing a clear
        comparative result.'

    aa8e7741-cb59-40fa-af92-8b296f700d7c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it suggested that 91367 has a higher
        population than 07726, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer was
        not explained as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end,
        but this appears inconsistent with its reasoning which suggests 91367 is more
        populous. Despite this inconsistency, we must take the explicit "NO" answer
        at face value per instructions.'

        equal. Instead, it indicates that 91367 CA has a higher population than 07726
        NJ, citing reasons such as urbanization and density differences. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 07726, NJ
        is not more populous than 91367, CA" as a clear comparative answer.

    c3c9cdbc-54ad-4235-ba43-81d894a6b230:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes 91367 has a higher population,
        citing reasons like being in a more urban area and part of Los Angeles. The
        model indicates a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 07726, NJ is not
        more populous than 91367, CA" as its final comparative conclusion.

    cde766ff-8937-4a3b-9dd3-2523845d072b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it indicates that one area (91367) has a larger population
        than the other (07726), noting that Woodland Hills "has a substantial population"
        and Manalapan "typically has a smaller population." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 07726 is not more
        populous than 91367" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the

        equal. Instead, it explicitly indicates that 91367 (Woodland Hills) has a
        higher population than 07726 (Manalapan), citing reasons such as being in
        a major metropolitan area with higher density. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 07726, NJ is not

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs access to exact population data to
        make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it states
        "Payette, ID typically has a larger population than Grafton, WV" - indicating
        a difference in values, not equality. The NO is based on one location having
        a larger population than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the likely answer is NO"
        while acknowledging uncertainty about current data. Since it provides a directional
        NO answer (even with caveats), this should be classified as NO rather than
        UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        equal. Instead, it indicates that Payette, Idaho "is known to have a larger
        population" than Kingwood, West Virginia, showing a difference in values.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 26354, WV is not

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (5,000
        vs 7,000 residents) and indicates that 83661 is more populous than 26354.
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" after determining that 83661 is more populous than
        26354. This is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it didn't have the population data
        to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we can't give a definitive

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot affirmatively determine which zip code is more

        Instead, it explicitly states that Marlborough, CT has a "slightly larger
        population" (6,400 vs 6,200 people). This difference, even though described
        as "slightly larger," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        or suggest that the populations were equal. In fact, it argued that Memphis
        (38118) would have a higher population than Yakima (98908) due to being more
        urban with higher density. The NO answer appears disconnected from the reasoning,
        but nowhere does it claim equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this seems inconsistent with its preceding analysis which suggested
        38118 was more populous. Despite this logical inconsistency, we must classify
        based on the explicit final answer given.

        equal. Instead, it indicates that 38118 is more populous than 98908, noting
        that Memphis has higher population density than Yakima. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 98908, WA

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states that 50012 (Ames)
        has a higher population due to the university presence, while 20778 (West
        River) is described as a smaller rural community. The NO answer was given
        because one area was determined to be more populous than the other, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 20778, MD
        is not more populous than 50012, IA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - instead, it explicitly indicates that 50012 has a higher population
        due to the university presence, while 20778 has a lower population due to
        being rural/suburban. The NO answer is based on this difference in populations,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 20778, MD is not
        more populous than 50012, IA" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - instead, it explicitly indicates that 50012, IA is more populous due
        to having a university population, while 20778, MD is described as a "relatively
        small, unincorporated community." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 20778, MD is not
        more populous than 50012, IA" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it indicates that 50012 (Iowa) has a higher population due
        to being a university area, while 20778 (Maryland) has a lower population
        as a small community. The NO answer is based on this difference in populations,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 20778, MD
        is not more populous than 50012, IA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

    d4eb3ec2-27f6-4908-8ad9-abcc3c09baca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - instead, it concluded NO because it determined 50012 likely has a higher
        population than 20778 due to it being a university area compared to a small
        residential community. The NO was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to whether
        20778 is more populous than 50012, making a clear comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly indicated that 50012 (Ames) has a higher population
        than 20778 (West River), citing the presence of university students and staff
        as the reason for the difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to whether
        20778 is more populous than 50012. The answer was clear and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - instead, it indicates that 50012 has a higher population due to being
        a university area, while 20778 has a lower population due to being rural.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (20778, MD

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the determination without exact data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and only discusses general trends without making a clear
        comparative conclusion. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

        False according to the classification criteria. The question of equal values
        is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is likely
        YES" as its final conclusion, even though it expresses some uncertainty about
        the exact numbers. Since it provides a clear YES answer (albeit with caveats),
        this should be classified as YES.

        more populous" than Navasota (77868), suggesting a difference in population
        values. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 77868, TX is not
        more populous than 77328, TX" as its final comparative answer. While the model
        acknowledges limited access to current data, it still provides a definitive

        has a larger population than Navasota (77868), indicating a difference in
        values. The NO answer was given because 77868 was determined to be less populous,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 77868, TX is not
        more populous than 77328, TX" as its final answer. While the model acknowledges
        some uncertainty earlier ("Without current population data at hand, I cannot

        did suggest the populations "might be similar" but this wasn't part of a NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO without the current data" and does not give a clear comparative
        answer. Instead, it explains that it cannot make the determination without
        access to specific population numbers.

        model never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        access the data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer 'YES' or 'NO'" due to lack of access to population data. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it suggests that 60108, IL likely has a higher population
        than 99224, WA due to being part of the Chicago metropolitan area. The NO
        answer is based on this perceived difference in populations, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 99224, WA is not
        more populous than 60108, IL" as its final answer. While the model expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning ("likely answer"), it still provides a clear
        NO as its comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it indicates that Bloomingdale, IL (60108) has a higher population
        density than the areas covered by 99224 in Spokane, WA. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 99224, WA
        is not more populous than 60108, IL." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the comparison without data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot conclusively
        answer the question without further research" and "cannot definitively state
        which ZIP code is more populous." While it speculates about possibilities,
        it clearly indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison without specific
        population data.

        comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say which zip code is more populous" and does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it explains how one would make the comparison if data were available.

        Instead, it gives a specific directional comparison, stating that 60108 IL
        is more populous than 99224 WA (though this contradicts its earlier reasoning).
        The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result between the two ZIP codes.

        equal. Instead, it indicates that 60108 is likely to have a higher population
        than 99224 due to its proximity to Chicago and suburban characteristics. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 99224, WA
        is not more populous than 60108, IL." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        actually compared values or declared them equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        access the data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it explains that it cannot access the necessary population data and
        provides conditional statements about what the answer would be IF the data
        were available. This indicates an inability to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the populations are equal. Instead, it concluded that 60108, IL has a higher
        population than 99224, WA due to its location in a major metropolitan area.
        The model indicates a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 99224, WA is not more
        populous than 60108, IL" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative
        answer.

        that the populations are equal. Instead, it explicitly indicates that 60108
        "has a higher population compared to 99224," showing a difference in values
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear directional result indicating
        that 99224, WA is not more populous than 60108, IL.

        say 'YES' or 'NO'" and indicates it lacks the necessary population data to
        make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it indicates that zip code 95051 is likely larger than 33064,
        noting differences in population density and urban characteristics. The NO
        appears to be given because 33064 is NOT more populous than 95051 (rather
        than because they're equal).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations. The answer is clear and direct, making this
        a definitive NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that Santa Clara (95051) has "higher
        population density" and provides reasoning about Silicon Valley's urban development
        compared to Pompano Beach. The NO answer is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 33064, FL
        is not more populous than 95051, CA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

    7d77a512-4cad-4c6d-90c4-caeedaa7f515:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 95051, CA likely has a higher
        population density than 33064, FL due to its location in Silicon Valley. The
        NO answer is based on this implied difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 33064, FL is not
        more populous than 95051, CA" as its final comparative conclusion. While the
        model acknowledges some uncertainty earlier, it provides a clear NO answer
        at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests that 95051, CA "might be more populous
        than 33064, FL." The NO answer appears to be given due to uncertainty about
        the exact figures rather than because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer, so we should classify
        based on this explicit statement.'

    afa6f374-da80-4529-92c3-03e27e079b7c:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it suggested that 95051 (Santa Clara)
        likely has a higher population than 33064 (Pompano Beach), indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as its answer, though it qualifies
        this with words like "likely" and mentions needing verification. However,
        since it explicitly provides NO as a comparative result (saying "33064, FL
        is not more populous than 95051, CA"), this counts as a NO answer rather than
        UNKNOWN.

    d7325b03-ae11-4267-be8a-51c166274cb8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that Santa
        Clara (95051) likely has a higher population than Pompano Beach (33064) due
        to its location in Silicon Valley and economic factors. Since the NO is based
        on a difference (one being higher than the other), not equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 33064, FL is not
        more populous than 95051, CA" as its final answer. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

        equal - in fact, it indicates that 95051 is likely more populous than 33064.
        The NO answer is given because 33064 has a lower (not equal) population, based
        on the model's reasoning about Silicon Valley population density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is
        NO; 33064, FL is not more populous than 95051, CA." This is a clear comparative

        populous" and describes it as "highly populated" while Pompano Beach (33064)
        is "less dense." The NO answer is based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 33064, FL
        is not more populous than 95051, CA." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never indicated the populations were equal
        - it actually suggested they were likely different but couldn't verify the
        exact numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO" in its final answer,
        it heavily qualifies this with "based on typical assessments, but verify with
        up-to-date data for accuracy" and throughout the response emphasizes that
        it cannot access current data to make a definitive comparison. The response
        is essentially saying it cannot determine the answer without current data,
        making this an UNKNOWN classification.

    ea27c673-be0f-4884-9b0c-88a7d3fc50db:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        numbers, it does not state that the populations are equal. Instead, it suggests
        that 48213 likely has a higher population due to being an urban area compared
        to the suburban 10567. The NO answer is based on this expected difference
        in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 10567, NY is not
        more populous than 48213, MI" as its final answer, even though it acknowledges
        some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative
        conclusion, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 48213 has a higher population
        despite population decline, due to being an urban area compared to the suburban
        10567. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 10567, NY
        is not more populous than 48213, MI." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        was historically more populous than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer would tend to
        be NO, but it requires verification with up-to-date information." Since it

        population figures" and "similar population sizes" with both having "approximately
        77,000 people." The NO answer is given precisely because they have the same
        population, making this a case where equality is the primary reason for the
        NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 78577, TX

        (even if small), rather than exact equality being the reason for the NO answer,
        this does not qualify as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests differences in population throughout
        its analysis, ultimately concluding that one is not more populous than the
        other, but without indicating equality as the reason. The model appears to
        contradict itself (saying Monroe is larger in step 4 but then concluding NO),
        but we must evaluate based solely on the final NO answer and whether equality
        was stated as the reason, which it wasn't.

        to Chicago and status as a suburban area, is likely to have a higher population
        than Monroe, NC"). The model indicates a difference in populations, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "the answer leans towards YES, but
        it is not definitive without exact data." While it suggests YES as more likely,
        it explicitly qualifies this as uncertain and not definitive. This indicates
        the model cannot make a clear determination, making this an UNKNOWN response

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        at all, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values were the reason for a NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's difficult to provide
        a definitive YES or NO" and suggests checking current data. It does not make
        a clear comparative determination, instead explaining that it cannot make
        the comparison without access to specific population data.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't definitively
        say YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison without exact population
        figures. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer.

        based on equal values - it gave a response indicating inability to determine
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model does not
        state or suggest that the populations are equal. In fact, it explicitly suggests
        a difference, stating that 33176 is "likely more populous." The NO answer
        appears contradictory to the reasoning, but nowhere does it mention equal
        or same values as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine. While the reasoning seems to contradict the NO answer
        (since it states "it is likely that zip code 33176... is more populous"),
        we must take the explicit NO answer at face value per instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it suggested that 89508 (Reno area)
        likely has a higher population than 14904 (Elmira area). The NO answer was
        based on a perceived difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 14904, NY is not
        more populous than 89508, NV" as its final conclusion, despite earlier expressing
        uncertainty. Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative answer, we classify
        this as NO rather than UNKNOWN, even though it previously mentioned inability
        to access current data.

        equal - instead, it concludes NO because it believes 89508, NV has a larger
        population than 14904, NY, citing growth trends and demographic data as reasoning.
        The model indicates a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO; 14904, NY is not

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains it lacks access to the necessary population data
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional comparison based on trends,
        suggesting that the Reno area (89508) has been growing while Elmira (14904)
        has not seen significant increases. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 14904, NY is not
        more populous than 89508, NV" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the populations are equal. Instead, it suggests that 89508 likely has
        a higher population due to growth trends in the Reno area compared to declining
        populations in areas like Elmira, NY. The NO is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 14904, NY is not
        more populous than 89508, NV" as its final comparative conclusion, making
        this a clear NO answer.

        Instead, it indicated that 89508 is likely more populous than 14904, citing
        population growth in Reno versus decline in Elmira. The NO answer was based
        on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 14904, NY
        is not more populous than 89508, NV." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs specific population numbers to make
        a determination. While it speculates about general trends, it refuses to make
        a definitive comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it indicates that Preston, CT "tends to have a slightly higher
        population" and makes a comparative assessment that Preston likely has a larger
        population than Troy. The NO answer is based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO, 22974, VA is not more populous than 06365, CT." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 46814 has a larger population,
        indicating a difference between the two values. The NO was based on 32055
        having a smaller (not equal) population than 46814.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model actually indicates a difference in population,
        stating that Fort Wayne (46814) is likely more populous than Lake City (32055).
        The NO is given because 32055 is NOT more populous than 46814, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it uses the word "likely". Since it provides a clear directional
        comparison concluding with "NO", this counts as a NO answer rather than REFUSED
        or UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model did not make any claims about
        equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison without data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't definitively
        say YES or NO" and provides no final comparative answer, only instructions
        on how to find the answer. This indicates inability to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it indicated that 10069 NY is "likely to have a substantially
        higher population" than 18066 PA, citing the urban vs rural nature of the
        areas. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 18066, PA
        is not more populous than 10069, NY." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - instead, it indicates that 10069 NY has a higher population than 18066
        PA due to being in Manhattan versus a rural area. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 18066, PA is not
        more populous than 10069, NY" as its final comparative answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on reasoning that the NYC
        zip code would have a higher population than the rural PA zip code, indicating
        a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative judgment that 18066, PA is not more populous than

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly indicates that 10069 (Manhattan) has a higher
        population than 18066 (rural PA). The NO answer is given because one area
        has a larger population than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO. 18066,
        PA is not more populous than 10069, NY." as its final answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it states that "76119 in Fort Worth has a population
        that is generally larger than that of 60120" (though this contradicts its
        final NO answer). Since equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 76119, TX
        is not more populous than 60120, IL." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        (24,000 vs 31,000) and the NO answer is based on this difference, not on the
        values being equal. The model indicates 62703 has a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, 55118,
        MN is not more populous than 62703, IL" as its final answer. This is a direct
        comparative NO response.

        being equal. Instead, it suggests that 62703 (Springfield) likely has a larger
        population than 55118 (West St. Paul), indicating a difference between the
        values. The NO is given because the first location has a smaller (not equal)
        population than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. While it acknowledges some uncertainty
        about exact numbers, it makes a definitive conclusion based on general knowledge
        about the cities.

        populous due to being an urban area compared to the suburban 55118. The NO
        answer is based on this perceived difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty about exact numbers. The NO

        equal. Instead, it indicated that Boca Raton (33433) is "typically known to
        be more populous" than Kentwood (49508), suggesting a difference in values.
        This difference, not equality, was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledged some uncertainty about the exact population
        figures.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        the comparison without data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        provide a definitive YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without specific population numbers. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say YES or NO" and indicates it needs more data to reach a conclusion. While
        it notes that Boca Raton is "considered more densely populated," it doesn't
        make a definitive comparative claim and emphasizes the need for verification.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Without the specific
        data, I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot
        access the necessary population data to make the comparison. This indicates
        an inability to determine the answer rather than a refusal to compare or a

        for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model suggests that 39218 "might be more
        populous" and "leans towards YES", it explicitly states it cannot provide
        a definitive answer without current population data. The response avoids making
        a firm YES/NO statement, instead qualifying its speculation and requesting

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it actually suggested they could be similar but
        emphasized it lacked data to make any definitive comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (without specific data, we cannot
        definitively say 60487 is more populous)." This is a case where the model
        explicitly states it cannot determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN
        rather than a NO comparative result. The parenthetical explanation clarifies
        that the "NO" is about the ability to determine, not about the comparison
        itself.

        that 75230 (Dallas) likely has a larger population than 60487 (Tinley Park)
        due to urban vs suburban characteristics. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, 60487, IL is not more
        populous than 75230, TX" based on trends, making this a clear NO answer. While

        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't access the necessary data to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO without current data access" and indicates it lacks the necessary

        in population sizes, with 14204 (Buffalo) being more populous than 92276 (Thousand
        Palms). The NO was because the first location had a smaller (not equal) population
        than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 92276, CA
        is not more populous than 14204, NY." While the model acknowledged uncertainty

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Larchmont has a
        smaller population (6,000-7,000) compared to Warren (9,000-10,000). The NO
        answer was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific population ranges
        to support this conclusion (6,000-7,000 vs 9,000-10,000).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. In fact, it suggests that Luray, VA "might have had a slightly larger
        population" than Dudley, MA. While it mentions the populations "could be similar,"
        this is not given as the reason for the NO answer - rather, the difference
        in population (with Luray being larger) is the stated reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 01571, MA is not
        more populous than 22835, VA" as its final comparative answer. While the model
        acknowledges uncertainty about exact numbers, it provides a definitive NO

        the populations were equal - it actually suggested they were different, with
        Dudley being smaller than Luray.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it prefaces
        this with uncertainty ("I cannot provide a definitive answer" and "likely"),
        making this an uncertain conclusion rather than a definitive comparative result.

        "significantly higher population" and its zip codes as "larger populations
        than those of smaller cities like Gallatin." The NO was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 37066, TN

        ZIP code 99208 is more populous than Gallatin's ZIP code 37066," indicating
        a difference in values. The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning,
        but we must evaluate based on what was stated - and equality was not given
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two ZIP codes. While the reasoning
        suggests 99208 is more populous than 37066 (which seems to contradict a "NO"

        but needs verification.

        "might lean towards" and "verify with current data to be certain." It does

        larger population", "could have a larger population"). The NO answer wasn't
        explained as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this seems inconsistent with its preceding analysis which suggested
        99208 would be more populous. Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit
        final answer rather than resolve contradictions, we classify this as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Morgantown, KY (ZIP code 42261)
        has a smaller population compared to College Place, WA (ZIP code 99324)" -
        indicating a difference in values, not equality. The NO answer is based on
        one being smaller than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 42261, KY is not
        more populous than 99324, WA" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it indicates that College Place, WA has a larger population
        than Morgantown, KY. The NO answer is based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 42261, KY is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - instead, it indicated College Place, WA has a "significantly higher population"
        than Olmstead, KY due to being an urban area with a university. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 42261, KY
        is not more populous than 99324, WA" as a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that College
        Place (99324) "tends to have a larger population than Morgantown, KY." The
        NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While this seems to contradict its reasoning (which suggests 99324 IS more
        populous), we must take the explicit "NO" answer at face value per instructions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it indicates that 99324 is more populous than 42261, meaning
        there is a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 42261, KY is not
        more populous than 99324, WA" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly indicates that College Place, WA has a larger
        population than Olmstead, KY, describing one as "more urban" with "larger
        population" and the other as "rural" with "relatively small population". The
        NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 42261 in KY is not
        more populous than 99324 in WA" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it suggests that 99324 (College Place, WA) likely has a larger
        population than 42261 (Nortonville, KY), indicating a difference in values.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 42261, KY
        is not more populous than 99324, WA." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

    b1828399-9c55-47b5-ae08-76a6e66aad10:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never suggested
        the populations were equal - it actually suggested they were likely different
        but couldn't confirm the exact relationship without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model hypothesizes that 42261 is "NOT more
        populous," it explicitly states this is an assumption and repeatedly emphasizes
        that it cannot make a definitive comparison without exact population data.
        The model's uncertainty and request to verify with actual data makes this
        an UNKNOWN rather than a NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        equal - in fact, it indicates that College Place, WA "is known to have a larger
        population" than Olmstead, KY. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 42261, KY is not
        more populous than 99324, WA" as its final comparative conclusion.

        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that College Place (99324) "likely
        has a higher population than Morgantown (42261)". The NO answer is based on
        a difference in population (with 99324 being higher), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that 42261, KY is
        not more populous than 99324, WA. While the model acknowledges some uncertainty
        in its data, it still provides a definitive NO answer.

        of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex compared to the smaller town of Huntingdon,
        PA. The NO answer is based on this difference in size, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 16652, PA
        is not more populous than 75054, TX." While it expresses some uncertainty
        about exact figures, it provides a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly indicates a difference, stating that 75054 is
        "more populous" than 16652. The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning,
        but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the reasoning in the steps suggests 75054 is more populous, the final
        "NO" answer is clear and unambiguous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly argued that 75054
        would likely have a higher population than 16652 due to being in an urban
        area vs. rural area. The NO answer appears contradictory to the reasoning,
        but nowhere does it claim equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this seems inconsistent with its reasoning which suggests 75054 is
        more populous. Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit final answer
        rather than resolve contradictions, we classify this as NO.

        answer was based on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 16652, PA
        is not more populous than 75054, TX." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the populations were equal. Instead, the model indicated that 07306 (Jersey
        City) tends to have higher population densities and greater population numbers
        compared to 33018 (Hialeah Gardens). The NO was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether 33018 is more populous than 07306. The model made a clear
        comparative statement indicating that 07306 is likely more populous than 33018.

        ("Jersey City (07306) is generally more populous due to its urban setting").
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 33018, FL
        is not more populous than 07306, NJ" as a comparative result. While it expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO answer.

        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined 07306 has a higher population
        due to "higher population density and urban nature" compared to 33018. The
        model identified a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to whether
        33018 is more populous than 07306, making a clear comparative statement that
        07306 is likely more populous than 33018.

        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison
        due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" as its answer, but qualifies
        it with uncertainty ("not necessarily") and indicates it lacks data for a
        definitive comparison. This makes it clear the model cannot determine the
        answer, rather than making a comparative conclusion. The response essentially
        states it cannot verify the comparison.

        on this difference (one being more populous than the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 33018, FL is not
        more populous than 07306, NJ" as its final comparative answer. While the model

        density and concluded that Jersey City (07306) has higher population density
        than Hialeah Gardens (33018). The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While this seems to contradict its reasoning (which suggests 07306 IS more

        Radcliff, KY. The model suggests there is a difference in populations, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in the data. While it uses
        the word "likely," it still makes a definitive NO statement rather than refusing

        populous" than 57103, indicating a difference in population. The NO appears
        to be answering whether 57103 is more populous than 98662, not indicating
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Vancouver and zip code 98662
        have a larger population compared to Sioux Falls and zip code 57103. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 57103, SD is not
        more populous than 98662, WA" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        populations (25,000 vs 45,000) and indicates that 98662 is more populous than
        57103. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it suggested that 98662 would have
        a higher population due to being part of the Portland metro area. The NO answer
        appears to contradict the reasoning, but nowhere does it state the populations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this seems to contradict its reasoning which suggests 98662 is more
        populous. Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit final answer rather
        than resolve contradictions, we classify this as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the comparison without data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison without
        specific population data. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot determine the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined 20008 DC was more populous
        than 60187 IL, citing urban vs suburban density patterns as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 60187, IL
        is not more populous than 20008, DC" as a clear comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it suggested that 60187 likely has
        a lower population due to being suburban vs urban. Since the NO was based
        on an implied difference in populations (not equality), this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 60187, IL is not
        more populous than 20008, DC" as its comparative conclusion, even though it
        adds a caveat about checking actual data. Since it provides a clear NO as
        its comparative answer, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the populations are equal. Instead, it suggests that 20008 likely has a higher
        population due to urban density. The model explicitly states a difference
        (with DC having higher population), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" answer in its conclusion,
        even though it expresses some uncertainty about the data. The NO is stated
        explicitly as part of a comparative conclusion, making this a clear NO response
        rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests differences between the areas (suburban
        vs urban, different characteristics) and arrives at its NO conclusion without
        mentioning equality. The NO appears to be based on a comparison finding one
        larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 60187, IL
        is not more populous than 20008, DC." This is a clear NO answer comparing

        compared to Lake Saint Louis, Missouri (63367)" and that "63367 (Lake Saint
        Louis, MO) usually has a higher population." The NO answer was based on this
        difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear and explicit "NO" answer
        in its conclusion, stating "NO, 35640, AL is not more populous than 63367,

        Instead, it indicated that 63367 (Lake Saint Louis) is more populous than
        35640 (Hartselle), describing Lake Saint Louis as having "a larger population
        due to its suburban nature." The NO answer was based on this difference in
        population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 35640, AL

        that the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Lake Saint
        Louis is "generally more populous than Hartselle," indicating a difference
        in population values. The NO answer was given because of this difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that 35640 is not more populous than 63367. The answer

        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't access the data
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say" and "I am unable to provide a YES or NO answer without this specific
        information." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of data access.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population ranges (14,000-15,000
        vs 16,000-19,000) and indicates that 63367 has a larger population than 35640.
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response after walking through its reasoning.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say YES or NO without the latest data" and does not provide a clear comparative
        conclusion. While it suggests one "might be" more populous, it emphasizes
        the need for specific data to make a determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide the
        definitive YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more data to make the
        comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values - it simply stated it
        couldn't make the determination without data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it explicitly states that it "can't definitively say which
        ZIP code is more populous" and indicates that "the answer requires specific
        data for a clear YES or NO conclusion." This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the populations are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests there are
        likely differences in population density between the regions, just without
        precise data. The NO is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first states it cannot provide a definitive
        YES/NO without current data, but then contradictorily gives a clear "NO" answer.
        Since there is an explicit "NO" stated as the answer (even though this contradicts
        the earlier uncertainty), we must classify based on this explicit answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly indicated that Elko
        New Market (55020) "has a population larger than Leonardo (07737)" - indicating
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provided a clear and explicit "NO" answer
        to whether 07737 is more populous than 55020, stating "Thus, the answer to

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the populations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the determination without specific
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, 07737, NJ is not necessarily
        more populous than 55020, MN without specific data." Since this NO is qualified
        with "without specific data" and indicates inability to determine, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that Leonardo "likely has a smaller
        population than Elko New Market." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Thus, the answer
        is NO, 07737, NJ is not more populous than 55020, MN." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly states different population values (13,000-14,000
        for 92075 vs 6,000-7,000 for 79835) and uses this difference to reach its
        conclusion. The NO answer is based on 92075 having a larger population, not
        because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 92075, CA is not
        less populous than 79835, TX" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Solana Beach (92075) has a smaller
        population compared to the combined areas often associated with 79835." The
        NO answer was based on a difference in values (one being smaller than the
        other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 92075, CA

        ("likely has a larger population") than 92075 ("has a smaller population"),
        giving this as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - instead, it indicated that Elwood, IN "tends to have a larger population"
        than Lawnside, NJ. The NO answer was based on this difference in population
        sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 08045 is more populous than 46044, making this
        a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b956512a-d19e-4672-b26e-b4facc3ecfcf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the populations were equal - it actually suggested they
        were likely different, with Elwood, IN probably being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO, 08045, NJ is likely
        not more populous than 46044, IN", the response repeatedly emphasizes that
        it cannot access actual data and cannot make a definitive determination. The
        model explicitly states "I cannot definitively say which is more populous"
        and prefaces its NO with "my answer is not definitive, but based on typical
        assumptions." This indicates uncertainty rather than a definitive comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d18d6e80-7239-493f-b076-6507dcc0e3b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never suggested
        the populations were equal - it actually suggested they were different (with
        Lawnside being smaller than Elwood).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and while it suggests "historically, the answer is likely
        NO," it does not make a definitive comparative statement. The response indicates
        uncertainty due to lack of current data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f0a5a67a-1aa2-443d-afd5-f4c7e977b75e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lawnside, NJ has a smaller population
        compared to Elwood, IN" and indicates that Elwood is "significantly larger."
        The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 08045 in New Jersey
        is not more populous than 46044 in Indiana" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f3ca22d4-9f11-44b1-9114-03b1eb51057d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The NO answer was not based on equal values - rather,
        the model suggests that Elwood, IN might be more populous than Lawnside, NJ
        because "cities tend to have larger populations than boroughs." The values
        are suggested to be different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Thus, the answer is likely
        NO." While it expresses some uncertainty earlier, it does provide an explicit
        NO answer as its final comparative conclusion, even if tentative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f4f61aeb-7dce-4524-a2e7-635ccff398c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values, but this is irrelevant since the answer
        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and suggests that one would need current population data
        to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison without
        additional data.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    fe74d576-477f-4cf0-8a36-d1b4f24e14c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed since
        it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative statement that "08045, NJ is more populous than 46044,
        IN."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
