      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Loeriesfontein is in Africa (South Africa) while San Isidro is in South
        America (Argentina), and that Loeriesfontein "cannot be east of San Isidro"
        because it's "in the opposite hemisphere." The model is claiming a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. In
        step 4, it correctly states "Loeriesfontein is geographically located to the
        east of San Isidro." But then in its final answer, it says "NO, Loeriesfontein
        is not located east of San Isidro, Buenos Aires; it is actually located to
        the east of it in terms of longitude." This is contradictory - saying it's
        not east, but then saying it is east. Due to this contradiction and lack of
        a clear YES/NO answer, I must classify this as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Sarai Alamgir is significantly further
        east than Praia a Mare (in terms of longitude)" and concludes that "Sarai
        Alamgir cannot be east of Praia a Mare." The model is indicating a difference
        in values (with Sarai Alamgir being further east), not equality. The reasoning
        appears contradictory (saying something is further east but cannot be east),
        but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not logical consistency.

        a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional relationship, not on equality of positions.

        because the locations are the same.

        in its analysis, but then concludes with "Thus, the answer to whether Nusa
        Kambangan is located east of Pemba Island is **NO**." This is a direct contradiction

    208039bc-9bc7-4671-8557-ab7c58ee2d3c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Koraput is located in the
        eastern part of India, while Agame is in the southern part of Ethiopia, which
        is west of India." The model's reasoning is that Koraput is actually further
        east than Agame (not equal), and therefore Koraput cannot be east of Agame.
        This is a directional comparison indicating difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question of whether Koraput district is located east of
        Agame.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the comparison due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (as we can't verify it
        without more information about Agame)". This is a case where the model is
        saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according
        to the instructions. The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information about Agame's location.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about Agame's location. The model states "Without
        specific coordinates or additional context about the location of Agame, we
        cannot definitively conclude whether Koraput is to its east." This indicates
        the model is saying NO because it cannot verify the comparison, not because
        it has determined that Koraput is not east of Agame.

      result: UNKNOWN

        In fact, it states that "Koraput is not east of Agame. In fact, it is generally
        to the east of Agame as you move from west to east around the globe." This
        appears to be contradictory (saying it's not east, then saying it is east),
        but the model is clearly not basing its NO answer on equality of positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Koraput district is located in India and is west
        of Agame (which is in Ethiopia), it cannot be east of Agame." The model is
        claiming there is a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on the reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not claim the values (locations) were equal -
        it actually suggested Sanderao might be west of Motobu, implying different
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        in the response. However, the model qualifies this answer with uncertainty,
        stating "assuming Sanderao is west of Motobu" and noting that "more specific
        information about Sanderao would be needed for a definitive answer." This
        indicates the model cannot determine the answer with the information available,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO.

        because it believes Motobu would be west of Sanderao (assuming Sanderao is
        in Taiwan or the Philippines). The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

        Okinawa" and "Sanderao is to the east of Okinawa." The model is claiming there
        is a directional difference between the locations, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Mirchaiya is south and slightly
        to the east of Bawshar" which indicates a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this positional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Mirchaiya is "not east of Bawshar
        but rather to the north." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (north vs. east), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model determined that Mirchaiya is not east
        of Bawshar but rather to the north.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Mirchaiya cannot be east
        of Bawshar due to their geographical separation, with Nepal being in South
        Asia and Oman being in the Middle East. The model is indicating a geographical
        relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        countries and "not directly comparable in terms of east or west because they
        are in different regions." The model actually states that "Mirchaiya is north
        and east of Bawshar when considering the overall map" but then gives other
        reasoning for its NO answer. Since the model does not claim the locations
        have equal coordinates or positions as the reason for its NO answer, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mirchaiya is located east of Bawshar. The answer
        is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Mirchaiya would not be east
        of Bawshar based on their relative geographical positions, stating "Nepal
        is generally situated northeast of Oman, it follows that Mirchaiya would not
        be east of Bawshar." The model is indicating a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Canada is significantly to
        the west of Spain" and concludes that "Uribarri cannot be east of Mascouche"
        because of their relative positions (Uribarri in Spain, Mascouche in Canada).
        The model is claiming there is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Uribarri is located east of Mascouche.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different continents and "cannot be accurately said that Uribarri is east
        of Mascouche since the two locations are in entirely different regions of
        the world." The model is not claiming equality but rather that the comparison
        itself is problematic due to the locations being in different geographical
        contexts.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model does not refuse to answer, and it provides
        a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        Bargal is not east of Bui without mentioning equality as the reason. The model
        doesn't provide any specific reason for why the answer is NO, such as the
        locations being at the same longitude or having identical positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Quilpie is not
        east of Savanne District based on their relative positions, with Savanne District
        being "further to the east in the Indian Ocean." The model is indicating a
        difference in positions, not equality.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Quilpie is significantly west of Savanne
        District's longitude" which indicates a clear difference in their positions.
        The model gives a NO answer because Quilpie is west of Savanne District, not
        because they are at the same location.

        of Savanne District ("Quilpie is not east of Savanne District. In fact, Quilpie
        is west of Savanne District when considering the global map"). The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Quilpie is to the west of Savanne District,
        indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The reason
        for the NO answer is that Quilpie is west of Savanne District, not east as
        asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that La Vera (which it assumes
        is in Italy) would be southeast of Succasunna, not directly east. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on directional difference (southeast
        vs. east), not equality of values.

        Atlantic Ocean from Succasunna" rather than directly east. The model is giving
        a NO answer based on geographical reasoning, not because the locations are
        identical or equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot confirm
        that Verd is located east of Cape May, New Jersey." This is not a definitive
        NO to the comparison itself, but rather indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information about Verd's location. The model explicitly
        states it "cannot definitively locate it in relation to Cape May without more
        information." This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        This is a case where the model is saying it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information, not making a definitive comparative judgment. The
        "NO" here means "No, I cannot verify" rather than "No, Verd is not east of

        where the model is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information about Verd's location. The parenthetical

        than a definitive comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Huntington being on the East Coast and Adams
        County being in the central part of the country. The model concludes that
        "Huntington is not east of Adams County" because Adams County is west of New
        York, not because they are in the same location. The model is actually making
        a directional error in its reasoning, but that doesn't affect our classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to
        the question of whether Huntington, New York is located east of Adams County,
        Colorado.

        the eastern side of the United States and Adams County, Colorado is in the
        west, Huntington is not east of Adams County." The model is claiming that
        Huntington is actually west of Adams County (which is factually incorrect,
        but that's not relevant to our analysis). The NO answer is based on a claimed
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is **NO**" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is not meaningful
        because the locations are on different continents with significant distance
        between them. The reason for the NO is not that the locations have equal longitude
        values, but rather that their relative positions cannot be meaningfully compared
        in terms of east/west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are equal.\
        \ In fact, it explicitly states that \"Bandar Baharu District, Malaysia, has\
        \ a longitude of approximately 100\xB0E\" while \"Idjwi, DRC, has a longitude\
        \ of about 29\xB0E\" and concludes that \"Since 100\xB0E (Bandar Baharu) is\
        \ significantly further east than 29\xB0E (Idjwi), it can be concluded that\
        \ Bandar Baharu is not located east of Idjwi.\" The model is noting a difference\
        \ in values, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question of whether Bandar Baharu District is located east
        of Idjwi.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c2839fef-bc0a-4c20-9c2a-f161a1d493e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Bandar Baharu District is
        not east of Idjwi; in fact, it is thousands of kilometers to the southeast
        of Idjwi, across the Indian Ocean." This indicates a difference in location
        (southeast rather than east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: **YES**" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a YES answer to
        the comparative question.'
