    0a128967-d7fa-4505-bdd7-7fe110a89e0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, explaining
        that Inishvickillane is "not east of Montebello" because places in western
        Europe are "generally much further east than places in eastern North America."
        The model is indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is explicit and direct at the end
        of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Inishvickillane is east of
        Montebello (stating "Inishvickillane is west of mainland Europe, it is still
        far to the east of North America and therefore east of Montebello"). The model
        is indicating a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Inishvickillane (west of
        Ireland) would be further west than Montebello, Quebec. This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Inishvickillane, being west of the European mainland, is still significantly
        east of Montebello." The model is indicating a clear geographical difference
        between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Inishvickillane is *west* of Montebello." The model's reasoning indicates
        that the locations have different positions, with one being west of the other,
        which is the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a directional difference,
        saying "Inishvickillane is *west* of Montebello, Quebec." The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional relationship, not on equality of values.

        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Inishvickillane
        is located east of Montebello, Quebec" as its final conclusion. This is a
        clear affirmative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it determines that Inishvickillane
        is west of Montebello, not east. The model is explicitly noting a difference
        in position (west vs. east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of Inishvickillane and Montebello.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "Ireland is east of North America" and therefore "Inishvickillane is
        west of Montebello." The model is giving a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, not equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "India is significantly west of Ethiopia" and "Mulki is west of Arba
        Minch." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response without any
        qualifications or refusals.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mulki is west of
        Arba Minch, indicating a directional difference. The reason for the NO answer
        is that Mulki is west of Arba Minch, not east as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is bolded at the end of the response. The model directly answers the
        comparative question with a definitive negative.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Mulki, India is
        west of Arba Minch, Ethiopia, indicating a difference in longitude. The model
        states "Since India is west of Ethiopia, a location in western India (Mulki)
        would be west of a location in Ethiopia (Arba Minch)." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states "Western India is significantly
        west of East Africa" and "India is west of Ethiopia," indicating a difference
        in longitude. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. This is a direct response to the comparative question, indicating
        that the model believes one location is not east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Yuli, Hualien is
        significantly east of Mopidevi," indicating a clear difference in their locations.
        The NO answer appears to be in response to a question about whether Mopidevi
        is east of Yuli (though the original question isn't provided), and the model
        is saying NO because it determined Yuli is east of Mopidevi, not the other
        way around.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides directional information, stating
        "Gascoyne is west of Bungeni" and then gives a NO answer. The model is not
        saying NO because the locations are equal, but rather appears to be negating
        some unstated premise in the original question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Gascoyne is west
        of Bungeni (not east), which is a directional difference. The reason for the
        NO answer is that the locations have different relative positions (Gascoyne
        is west of Bungeni, not east as the question asked).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is an explicit negative response to the
        question of whether Gascoyne is east of Bungeni.

        being compared are the same. Instead, the model's reasoning indicates the
        locations are in different continents with different relative positions (North
        America is west of Europe). The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal or identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Uribarri east of Mascouche?" The model concludes that
        since North America is west of Europe, Mascouche (in Quebec) is west of Uribarri
        (in Spain), which means Uribarri is east of Mascouche. However, the model's
        final answer contradicts its own reasoning, as it says "NO" to whether Uribarri
        is east of Mascouche.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Central America is west of
        North America" which indicates a difference in location. The model is noting
        a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO."
        at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "The southwestern US is west of the eastern US" as the basis for its NO answer.
        The model is indicating a geographical difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Cape Verde, NJ, is slightly
        west of Cape May, NJ" and concludes NO because Cape Verde is west (not east)
        of Cape May. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with an explicit
        "NO" at the end.

    4006c9b3-4c7b-4e83-8893-e16ef3af675e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Verd is a fictional location from a video
        game while Cape May is a real-world location, and that fictional locations
        don't have real-world geographical coordinates. The NO answer is based on
        the impossibility of comparing a fictional location to a real one, not because
        they have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Verd is not located east of Cape May, New Jersey.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    49dc491e-fb7c-409a-9796-5d110c3cd584:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Verde, AZ is in the southwest" and "it is west of Cape May" and "Therefore,
        it is not east." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west
        vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        Verd is east of Cape May.

        question does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response. After analyzing the locations of Verd (which it
        identifies as likely Monte Verde in Lisbon, Portugal) and Cape May, New Jersey,
        it concludes with a definitive "YES".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Verde Valley (and any similarly
        named location likely meant by 'Verd') is west of Cape May, New Jersey." The
        NO answer appears to be based on a directional difference (west vs. east),
        not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
