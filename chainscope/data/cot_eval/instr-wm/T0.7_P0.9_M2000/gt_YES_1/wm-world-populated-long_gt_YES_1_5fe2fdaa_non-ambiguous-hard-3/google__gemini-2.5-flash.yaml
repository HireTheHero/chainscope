      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that "Agame" might not be a recognized
        geographical location or might not exist, and therefore Koraput cannot be
        east of it. The reasoning is about existence/non-existence rather than equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because the model cannot verify the comparison due to
        uncertainty about the location of Agame. The model states "we cannot answer
        the question" and that "the premise for comparison is flawed." The model is
        essentially saying it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information
        about one of the locations.

    691da87e-b828-446b-a87b-5cd777a6d47a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it gives NO because it cannot verify the location of "Agame"
        and therefore cannot confirm an "east" relationship. The model explicitly
        states "the lack of evidence for 'east' means the answer is not 'yes'" which
        indicates the NO is due to inability to verify the comparison, not because
        the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model initially explains that the question cannot be answered definitively
        because "Agame" cannot be located, it ultimately provides a clear "NO" answer
        at the very end of its response.

    ae562fcc-0a8d-4e61-8138-30709d826aa7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Koraput district is not located
        east of Agame (Angul). It is located to the west/southwest of Angul." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (west/southwest vs. east), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

    b4ec473a-3141-4ea4-8adf-322a547f232e:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it could not locate one of the places to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison because
        it cannot locate "Agame" definitively. The model states "it's impossible to
        determine if Koraput district is east of it" and "the question cannot be answered
        with a definitive YES or NO based on verifiable geographical information."
        This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine the answer,
        making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" label at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the answer because it cannot
        locate "Agame" to establish a directional relationship. The model states "The
        question cannot be answered definitively" and "we cannot answer whether Koraput
        is east of it." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify"
        or "NO, I cannot determine," which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    db1880e8-e347-4be3-b5a1-e1b79810682b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it cannot verify the
        location of "Agame" (which it believes may not be a known geographical location),
        making the comparison impossible to verify as true. The model's reasoning
        is that if a statement cannot be verified as true, then the answer defaults
        to NO. This is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f24de807-86bb-4c9d-bac5-51ab05c63007:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question is False. The model did not give a NO
        answer because the values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" at the end of its response.
        However, this NO is qualified by the model's explanation that it cannot locate
        "Agame" to determine its position relative to Koraput. The model explicitly
        states "a definitive YES or NO answer cannot be given" and "I cannot answer
        definitively." The model is essentially saying it cannot determine the answer
        due to insufficient information about one of the locations, which makes this
        an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f7b71ef6-84c2-4b9a-a5f1-3ba681e1ab4e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is "geographically
        nonsensical" because Agame is contained within Koraput district. The reason
        for the NO is not that the locations have equal coordinates, but rather that
        their relationship makes the directional comparison invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Koraput district cannot
        be 'east of' Agame" because Agame is within Koraput district.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f8db4855-76a3-434f-80e5-4456159e696b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it gives NO because it cannot confirm the statement due to
        inability to locate or identify "Agame." The model states "If I cannot find
        it, I cannot place it. If I cannot place it, I cannot determine if Koraput
        is east of it." This is a reason based on lack of information, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses uncertainty about the location of Agame and discusses
        the difficulty in answering the question, it ultimately provides a clear "NO"
        answer at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        east of Blue Nile State, indicating a difference in position. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is that Luxettipet is not west of Blue Nile State,
        but rather east of it. This is not based on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" but this is because it rejects the premise of the question since it
        claims "Mopidevi" is not a recognized geographical location. The model states
        "Without a verifiable location for 'Mopidevi,' it is impossible to determine
        if Yuli, Hualien is east of it." This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information about one of the locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, the answer is **NO**
        (because I cannot confirm it is YES)." However, this is not a comparative
        result but rather an indication that the model cannot determine the answer
        due to insufficient information about one of the locations. The model explicitly
        states "I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer" and explains that it
        cannot determine the location of Mopidevi. The final NO is qualified with
        an explanation that it's because the model "cannot confirm it is YES," which
        indicates inability to make the comparison rather than a definitive comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this appears inconsistent with its reasoning, as it previously
        stated "we cannot definitively answer the question" because it couldn't locate
        Mopidevi. Since the model is rejecting the premise of the question (claiming
        one location doesn't exist or can't be found), this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN despite the explicit "NO" at the end.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it cannot locate or
        verify the existence of "Ghasm" and therefore cannot confirm it is east of
        Hydra. The reasoning is about inability to verify the location, not about
        the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" as its final answer.
        While it initially explains that a definitive answer is not possible due to
        being unable to locate "Ghasm," it ultimately provides "NO" as its answer
        when forced to choose between YES and NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4dc5c077-c315-434e-9b88-4bbce172a9f5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values being
        compared are equal. Instead, it gives NO because it cannot locate "Ghasm"
        as a geographical entity and concludes that if it's not a known location,
        it cannot be east of Hydra. The model never states that the locations have
        equal coordinates or are the same place.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. While it spends most of the response explaining that it cannot
        locate "Ghasm" and struggles with answering, it ultimately provides a clear
        "NO" answer in its final statement: "Let''s make a final decision: if ''Ghasm''
        is not a known geographical location, then it cannot be east of Hydra. NO"'

    5ec713d4-e38f-40cd-b287-bd1c660c182d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model's NO appears to be based on
        the inability to definitively locate "Ghasm" as a recognizable place. The
        model does not state that the locations have equal or identical coordinates
        or positions. In fact, when considering a possible interpretation (Gaza),
        it notes it would be "significantly east" of Hydra, Algeria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While the model expresses uncertainty about the location of "Ghasm"
        and considers various possibilities, it ultimately provides a clear "NO" answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" at the end of its response,
        but this NO is given because the model cannot locate "Ghasm" as a geographical
        place and states "the premise of the question cannot be answered with a definitive
        YES or NO." The model is essentially saying it cannot determine the answer
        due to insufficient information about one of the locations, making this an
        UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7c3f69a9-44cf-4e9a-a788-bceee7b3e537:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that "Ghasm" may not exist or
        isn't a known place, and therefore cannot be east of Hydra. The reasoning
        is based on the potential non-existence of one location, not on the two locations
        having equal positions or values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it does express uncertainty about the existence of "Ghasm," it ultimately
        provides a definitive "NO" response to the comparative question, concluding
        that "the most accurate answer based on available information is: NO".'

    b227a3f2-efd8-40cd-bd7d-c5bccf750d65:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives "NO" because it cannot verify the location of
        "Ghasm" at all, stating "there is no verifiable location known as 'Ghasm'
        that can be placed relative to Hydra." This is not claiming equality but rather
        inability to locate one of the comparison points.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it initially discusses the difficulty in determining the location of
        "Ghasm" and suggests it cannot answer definitively, it ultimately concludes
        with a clear "NO" at the end of its response.

        (not NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, not because it *isn't* east, but because the premise contains an
        unidentifiable location, making a definitive comparison impossible." This
        is not a straightforward NO to the comparative question. Rather, the model
        is saying it cannot determine the answer because one of the locations (Ghasm)
        cannot be reliably located. The model is rejecting the premise of the question
        by indicating one of the locations doesn't exist or cannot be identified,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    dec891e8-826a-4a65-a1e8-54a340d0aaa5:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer because
        it cannot locate or verify "Ghasm" as a real place. The model states "the
        question cannot be answered with a definitive YES or NO based on verifiable
        geographic information" and only provides "NO" because it feels forced to
        choose between YES and NO. This is a case where the model is rejecting the
        premise of the question (that Ghasm exists as a location that can be compared).
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
