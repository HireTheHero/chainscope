      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for their
        lifespans (80 years vs 78 years) and does not claim they are equal. In fact,
        it specifically notes that Zhao Fen lived longer, even though this contradicts
        its final NO answer. Since the values are explicitly stated as different,
        this cannot be classified as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears inconsistent with its reasoning which shows Zhao Fen lived
        longer. Despite this contradiction, we must evaluate based on the explicit
        final answer given.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated a difference in lifespans
        (78 years vs. at least 80 years) and concluded that Zhao Fen likely lived
        longer than Duquesne.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to the question
        of whether Abraham Duquesne lived longer than Zhao Fen, after determining
        that Duquesne lived 78 years while Zhao Fen lived at least 80 years.

    d110f8c9-46fd-4533-b4f7-3feb485546c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Zhao Fen lived "significantly
        longer" than Abraham Duquesne (98 years vs 78 years). The NO answer was given
        because of this difference in lifespans, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly indicating that Abraham Duquesne did not live longer than Zhao
        Fen. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the lifespans are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Anastasia's lifespan was much shorter
        than William II's" and provides specific details about the difference (Anastasia
        died young while William II lived to about 67). The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Anastasia of Sirmium
        did not live longer than William II, Count of Chalon" as its conclusion. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly compares their different time periods and bases its
        NO answer on the fact that Anastasia lived and died centuries before William
        II. The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after explaining its reasoning about the comparative lifespans.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it explicitly states that William II lived longer (approximately
        54 years) compared to Anastasia (who likely lived only into early adulthood).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in lifespans, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Anastasia did NOT live longer than William II. This is a clear
        comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in lifespans, with William II living "significantly longer" (to his 80s) compared
        to Anastasia's shorter life (20s or 30s). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and concludes
        that "Anastasia of Sirmium did not live longer than William II, Count of Chalon."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that their lifespans were
        equal. Instead, it notes they lived in different time periods (3rd-4th century
        vs 10th century) and concludes NO based on when they lived, not because their
        lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "No, Anastasia of Sirmium
        did not live longer than William II, Count of Chalon." This is a clear NO
        answer comparing their lifespans.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    522f8c1f-c414-45f9-8b4d-5ae3d9699b0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Anastasia lived over 900 years before
        William II. The NO answer was given because Anastasia lived earlier, not because
        they had equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the two historical figures' lifespans. The answer is explicit
        and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7e9b42db-7468-4907-afb2-0ad75e73b69b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans were equal
        - in fact, it notes clear differences in their time periods and death dates
        (304 AD vs 1303 AD). The NO answer is based on comparative analysis showing
        they lived in different periods, not because they had equal lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is clearly presented as a comparative conclusion about whether Anastasia
        lived longer than William II.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d04c9303-b6f5-4d94-a6bf-5979779c339f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the lifespans were
        equal. Instead, it provides different death dates (304 AD vs 1168 AD) and
        explicitly notes they lived in different centuries. The NO answer is based
        on a comparison showing different values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Anastasia did
        not live longer than William II.

    d67a5734-52cd-4753-9faf-f8d002f74868:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the lifespans were equal. In fact, it explicitly notes differences in
        when they lived ("William II lived more than 900 years after Anastasia") and
        provides different death dates (304 AD vs 1218). The NO answer appears to
        be based on other reasoning rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the step-by-step explanation ("No, Anastasia of Sirmium did not live
        longer than William II") and in the bold "Answer: NO" conclusion. This is
        a clear comparative result.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the lifespans are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states "William II lived significantly longer than
        Anastasia." The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        the lifespans to make a comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, it immediately
        clarifies that this means it cannot confirm the comparison due to insufficient
        evidence. This is equivalent to saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        model never claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        the lifespans to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, it immediately
        clarifies that this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison due to lack
        of information. This is effectively stating that it cannot determine the answer,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one lifespan at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot determine the comparison
        because one figure (Abraham Memmius) has no verifiable historical record.
        While it says "NO" explicitly, it's actually indicating it cannot make the
        comparison due to missing information about one party, making this a rejection
        of the premise.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    49de9c04-6f71-46d4-aac3-139e942dc7bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the values
        to compare them.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this NO is given after
        explicitly stating it is "impossible to compare" their lifespans due to lack
        of information. When a model states it cannot determine or verify something
        and then gives NO, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies this
        is due to inability to determine/verify the comparison due to lack of evidence
        about Abraham Memmius. When a model says "NO" due to inability to verify/determine,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, it immediately
        clarifies in parentheses that this means it cannot confirm the comparison
        due to lack of information about one person. This is effectively stating it
        cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response never
        claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated one lifespan was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response includes "NO" in its final answer,
        it explicitly states this is because it "cannot conclude" the comparison and
        "cannot be answered definitively" due to missing information about one person's
        lifespan. This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the
        determination, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the lifespans at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer, explaining that it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (based on available evidence)"
        but also explicitly says "it is impossible to compare" and "we cannot determine

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated one lifespan was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (or the question cannot be answered
        definitively)" and explains that one person's lifespan is unknown/unverifiable.
        Since the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to missing
        information about one subject, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison due to insufficient information
        about one party. This is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        difference in lifespan, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a comparative result (specifically stating Abd ar-Rahman IV
        likely did not live longer than Gao Miaoyi). While the model expresses uncertainty
        about one person's lifespan, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lifespans were equal. The model suggests Abd ar-Rahman IV had a shorter
        life (20s or 30s) compared to an assumed "typical lifespan" for Gao Miaoyi.
        The NO answer was based on this assumed difference in length, not on equality

        claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is due to inability to verify/compare due to lack of data about one person.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison due to insufficient information
        about one party. This is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer,

        is not known historically. This is effectively stating it cannot make the
        determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about one figure's
        lifespan, it does not base its NO answer on the values being equal. Instead,
        it suggests that Abd ar-Rahman IV (who died young) likely did not live longer
        than the other figure, assuming a full/average lifespan for the latter. This
        implies a difference in lifespans rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty about one of the figures, it still provides

        were equal. Instead, it stated they lived in different time periods (approximately
        600 years apart) and concluded NO based on this temporal separation, not because
        of equal lifespans.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the lifespans were equal or the same. Instead, it based its NO answer
        on the fact that they lived in different centuries. The model never compared
        their actual lifespans or stated they were equal - it focused on their different
        time periods as the reason for its answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lifespans were equal. Instead, the model's reasoning was based on the
        impossibility of comparison due to the figures living in different time periods
        (separated by 400 years). The model never states their lifespans were equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. While the model notes it doesn't have exact lifespans,
        it still provides a definitive NO based on the historical periods, making
        this a clear NO answer rather than UNKNOWN.

        the model never claimed the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot confirm" which indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information. This is a case
        where the model is expressing inability to determine the answer, making it
        an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison due to insufficient information
        about one of the subjects. This makes it a case where the model indicates

        be compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot confirm...)" which
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to missing data about Aaron
        of Lincoln's lifespan. This is a case where the model explicitly states it
        cannot verify/determine the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly calculates different values (61 years vs 65 years)
        and states that "Seol Se-ung lived longer than Aaron of Lincoln." The NO answer
        appears to be given because Seol Se-ung lived longer, not because they lived
        equally long.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans, making this a clear NO response to whether
        Aaron of Lincoln lived longer than Seol Se-ung.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different values (61
        years vs 69 years) and concluded that Seol Se-woong lived longer than Aaron
        of Lincoln. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans, where it found that Seol Se-woong lived longer
        (69 years) than Aaron of Lincoln (61 years). This is a clear comparative NO

    4a77b093-e8ee-49f7-bf64-db6f6f9acd69:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        lifespans, it does not state that the lifespans are equal or the same. Instead,
        it concludes NO based on the "vast temporal gap between their lifetimes" and
        states it's "highly unlikely that Aba of Kashkar lived longer." Since the
        NO is not based on equal values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result about the lifespan comparison
        (even though the reasoning seems to mix up "living longer" with "living later").
        Since it's a clear NO statement about the comparison, this counts as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies it's
        due to insufficient information and inability to make the comparison. This

      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "Yes", this is not answering
        the comparative question about who lived longer. The model provides some historical
        context but never actually compares their lifespans or provides a clear YES/NO
        to the comparative question. The final statement is just describing Deng Fang's

        one of the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information)"
        but this is actually indicating an inability to determine the answer due to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about Song's
        exact lifespan, it does not state that their lifespans were equal or the same.
        The NO answer is given because there is "no definitive evidence that he lived
        longer than Ortelius," not because their lifespans were equal. The model is
        stating an inability to confirm one was longer, rather than stating they were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this NO is presented as a comparative result (not being able to
        confirm that Song lived longer than Ortelius). While the model expresses uncertainty
        about Song's exact lifespan, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        and states that "63 years (Huang Junhan) is longer than 34 years (Abadai Khan)".
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal.
        In fact, it suggests that Huang Junhan likely lived longer than Abadai Khan's
        52 years ("likely lived longer than 52 years"). The NO answer is based on
        a difference in values (Huang Junhan being estimated to have lived longer),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Abadai Khan did not
        live longer than Huang Junhan" as its conclusion. While there is uncertainty
        about Huang Junhan's exact lifespan, the model still provides a clear NO answer
        to the comparison.

        Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that the two figures
        lived in different centuries (17th vs 9th century). The model doesn't compare
        actual lifespan lengths or claim they were the same.

        was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While this appears to contradict its reasoning (which suggests Huang Junhan

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated one was 36 years and the
        other was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        this is because it "cannot definitively compare their lifespans" due to lack
        of data. This is equivalent to saying it cannot determine the answer, making
        this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer and explains that it cannot determine the comparison due to insufficient
        historical records. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that they lived in different time periods (centuries
        apart) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal.
        In fact, it explicitly noted they lived in different time periods (Sa Yu in
        53-130 CE, Abe no Hirafu in 500s-600s CE). The NO answer was given because
        they lived in different centuries, not because their lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it gave NO because it determined they lived in different centuries
        (7th vs 2nd century), with one living centuries after the other. The NO answer
        was based on their different time periods, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"Answer: NO\"\
        \ after determining that Abe no Hirafu did not live longer than \u5DE6\u96C4\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, even though it earlier expressed uncertainty about precise
        dates. Since it gave a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, we classify
        this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" in its final answer, it
        immediately clarifies that this is due to insufficient evidence to make the
        comparison. The model explicitly states it is "impossible to definitively
        compare their lifespans" and notes that it lacks verifiable information about

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined that Aaron the Tyrant lived centuries before Ishikawa Gakumori,
        making it "impossible for him to have lived longer." The model is noting a
        difference in time periods, not equality of lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this NO is presented as a definitive comparative
        result based on the temporal analysis provided.

        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (based on available information)"
        but explicitly indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information
        about one figure's lifespan. This is effectively stating it cannot determine

        that the lifespans were equal. Instead, it based its NO answer on the fact
        that Otto III lived in a later time period ("hundreds of years later"). The

        due to incomplete data about Abra of Poitiers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we cannot definitively say whether
        she lived longer" and concludes with "NO based on the available information".
        Since this NO indicates inability to determine rather than a comparative result,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN. The model is rejecting its ability to
        make the comparison due to lack of data.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies it's
        due to insufficient information/inability to determine the comparison. This

        one of the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (Cannot be determined with the
        available information)." Since this is explicitly stating an inability to
        determine the comparison due to missing information about one subject, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO. The parenthetical clarification

      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        with "(or Cannot be determined due to insufficient information about Feng
        Zuozhou)". The model explicitly states it cannot compare their lifespans due
        to lack of information about one person. This rejection of the ability to
        make the comparison makes this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO answer.

        it as NO, the model did not state the lifespans were equal - it stated one
        lifespan was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to lack of information about
        Feng Zuozhou's lifespan)". Since this NO indicates an inability to determine
        the comparison rather than a comparative result, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN. This is similar to Example 3 where "NO, I cannot verify" was classified

        (62 years vs 52 years). The model appears to have reached its NO conclusion
        despite showing unequal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result stating that Elizabeth did not live
        longer than Yury. The model provides specific calculations showing Elizabeth
        lived 62 years while Yury lived 52 years, though it appears to have made an

        (46 years vs 55 years) and stated that "Yury of Smolensk lived longer than
        Elizabeth le Despenser by about 9 years."

        (1389 vs 1407) and used this difference to conclude NO. The NO was based on
        comparative difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded "NO" and stated "Elizabeth

        The NO answer appears to be based on their different historical periods rather
        than having equal lifespans. Since equality of values is not stated as the
        reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        the model never claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        one of the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison due to insufficient information
        about one party. This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        longer than Ma Qi. The model is making a comparative judgment based on historical
        context rather than stating the values are the same.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that William II de Cantilupe
        likely lived into his 40s or 50s while Friedrich Gren lived 38 years, indicating
        different lifespans. The NO was given because William lived longer, not because
        their lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans, where it concludes that William II de Cantilupe
        lived longer than Friedrich Gren (not the other way around). This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

        the lifespans to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (cannot be determined with the
        available information)." Since this is explicitly stating an inability to
        determine the comparison due to lack of information, this should be classified

      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO", it immediately clarifies
        that this is "due to insufficient evidence to confirm" the comparison. This
        indicates the model cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative

        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it stated that Empress Zhang lived 50 years while Patriarch
        Michael II lived "well beyond 50 years" and "potentially into his 60s or beyond,"
        indicating a difference in their lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans were equal.
        Instead, it gives a clear reason for the NO answer based on their different
        death dates, noting that "Empress Zhang lived and died long before Patriarch
        Michael II." Since it indicates a difference rather than equality, and this
        difference is the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Empress Zhang did
        not live longer than Patriarch Michael II of Antioch" as its final answer.

        In fact, it suggests a difference, noting that Empress Zhang had a "much shorter
        lifespan (35 years) compared to the typical lifespan of someone in the 12th
        century." The NO answer is based on this comparative difference, not on equality.

        in lifespans, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded "NO, Empress Zhang

        time periods, with Empress Zhang living "over a millennium before" Patriarch
        Michael II. The model's reasoning was based on their different historical
        periods, not on equal lifespans.

        showed that Patriarch Michael II lived longer (73 years) than Empress Zhang
        (49 years).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Empress Zhang did not
        live longer than Patriarch Michael II of Antioch" after calculating their

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lifespans are equal.
        Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines they lived in different
        centuries and Empress Zhang died (1077) before Patriarch Michael II was even
        active (1160s-1170s). The model identifies a clear temporal difference between

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the lifespans of Abba Arika (72 years) and Guo Dan (60 years)'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    c1dccb73-c481-428f-a295-45dfb1aa63e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (72 vs 70
        years).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response after comparing the lifespans and finding that Abba Arika
        lived longer than Guo Dan by 2 years.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Abba Arika
        lived longer than Guo Dan" after comparing their lifespans (72 years vs 36
