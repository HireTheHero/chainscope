      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        states this is not based on actual comparison but due to lack of information
        about one party. The model clearly indicates it "cannot definitively compare
        their lifespans" and lacks "sufficient verified information." This makes it
        a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks complete information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to incomplete
        information about one of the subjects. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information
        about Zhao Fen's lifespan. The NO is given as a default due to inability to
        prove a YES claim, not as a comparative result. This makes it a case of being
        unable to determine the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the values were equal - it stated it lacked information about
        one value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly says this is
        because it "cannot confidently compare their lifespans" due to missing information
        about one person. This is effectively stating it cannot determine the comparison,
        making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" word being used.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it lacked information about one
        person's lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end,
        but earlier indicates it "cannot definitively answer" and lacks enough information.
        Since it expresses inability to determine the comparison but was "forced to

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different values (78 vs 49 years) rather than equal values.

        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the comparison
        due to missing information about one person's lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm with
        certainty that Duquesne lived longer)" - this is explicitly stating it cannot
        determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result. The parenthetical explanation clarifies that this is
        about inability to verify rather than a comparative conclusion.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" due to lack of complete information about one subject's lifespan.
        This indicates inability to make the comparison.

        the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one person's lifespan
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately clarifies that this NO means it cannot determine/verify the
        comparison due to incomplete information about one person's lifespan. This
        makes it a case of "NO, I cannot determine" which should be classified as
        UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides dates and timeframes for
        both individuals, it does not state that their lifespans were equal. Instead,
        it notes a difference of approximately 800 years between when they lived.
        The NO answer is based on a comparison showing difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        "Anastasia did NOT live longer than William II, Count of Chalon" as its conclusion

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the two figures
        having equal lifespans. Instead, it explicitly notes they lived in different
        time periods (Anastasia around 280-304 AD vs William II around 1100-1150 AD)
        and states that Anastasia died "relatively young" while William II lived a
        "full noble life." The NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a direct statement "Therefore, the answer is: NO." The model
        provides a clear comparison and reasoning for this answer.'

    3ab3c546-9a36-433f-ad77-cd1a7a7ee94d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (lifespans)
        are equal. Instead, it gives a NO answer because the figures lived in different
        time periods, with William living "several centuries AFTER Anastasia". The
        model is comparing different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final comparative conclusion, after walking through its reasoning
        steps.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that William lived "several centuries AFTER Anastasia" and uses this temporal
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model is comparing different
        time periods, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion. This NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        about whether Anastasia lived longer than William, not as a statement about
        inability to determine or verify.'

    a3d9bcb5-eddc-4df4-ba15-03a16598dccd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that William II lived several centuries after Anastasia
        and provides different lifespans for both individuals. The NO is based on
        a comparison showing they lived in different time periods, not because they
        lived equally long.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Anastasia lived longer than William II. This is
        a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a517df34-b6a0-46c1-aebb-cc609710cf45:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the lifespans were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that William
        lived "several centuries AFTER Anastasia" and bases its NO answer on this
        temporal difference, not on equality of lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Anastasia lived longer than William II. The answer
        is given definitively without caveats or uncertainty.

    a6db1edf-9191-4597-b662-2865fe540df4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on temporal sequence
        (William living several centuries after Anastasia), not because their lifespans
        were equal. In fact, the model explicitly noted different time periods for
        each person.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a direct comparative response to whether Anastasia lived longer than William
        II. This is a clear NO answer.'

    dbc2f1ad-312b-440c-b87b-e3ab9e56f65a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal lifespans
        - rather, it explains they lived in different time periods (Anastasia in 4th
        century vs William II in 11th/12th century). The model doesn't state or suggest
        their lifespans were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Anastasia did NOT live longer
        than William II.

    deb9a196-b30a-442d-945b-7052e0b9ccbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the lifespans are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes that "William II lived significantly longer than
        Anastasia of Sirmium" (23 years vs 53 years). The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that William II lived longer than Anastasia. This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

    e408269e-9fdf-4a55-95e6-7b31a1ce4d69:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference,
        noting "William lived about 800 years AFTER Anastasia." The NO is based on
        this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, making a direct comparative judgment based
        on its analysis of their lifetimes.'

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information
        ("I cannot definitively compare their lifespans"). When a model says "NO"
        because it cannot determine the answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN

        automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the values were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot responsibly
        answer YES or NO" and "do[es] not have enough information to answer this question."
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information to make

        the values were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient information to make
        any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confidently
        confirm that I know enough to say YES)" - this is explicitly indicating an
        inability to determine the comparison, not a comparative result. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN criteria as the model is stating it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        claimed the lifespans were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the lifespans
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to inability to confirm/determine ("cannot confirm a YES,
        and [...] cannot confidently state"). This makes it a case of "NO, I cannot

        I cannot verify the facts" and "the default assumption should be that I do
        not have evidence supporting a YES"). It never states or implies the lifespans
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty. While it shows hesitation and indicates it
        cannot verify the facts, it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative
        answer.

        a NO comparison or claimed the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot determine the answer.

        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the lengths
        due to missing data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison due to lack of data. This
        is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a definitive NO comparison.

        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confidently
        confirm...)" but this is actually expressing inability to determine rather
        than a comparative result. This is equivalent to "NO, I cannot verify" which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it lacked information
        about one of the subjects.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first states it "cannot provide a YES or
        NO answer with certainty" but then gives a conditional NO answer based on
        inability to confirm the comparison. Since the model indicates it cannot determine/verify
        the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        comparison due to lack of information about one person, but then provides
        "NO" as a default answer because it felt compelled to give YES/NO. Since the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison, this should be classified as

      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO", it explains this is because
        it "cannot confirm" or "cannot definitively state" the comparison. This makes
        it a case of being unable to determine rather than a comparative result, which
        classifies as UNKNOWN per the criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        that Nestor lived longer (82 years) compared to Louis (62 years). The values
        are explicitly different, not equal, and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the lifespans, with no ambiguity or qualification.

        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the values to compare
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it explicitly states
        this is because it "cannot prove" or "cannot confidently determine" the comparison.
        This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than a comparative
        result, making this an UNKNOWN response per the criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is due to inability to confirm ("because I cannot confirm") and lack
        of complete information. This makes it clear that the model is expressing
        inability to determine rather than a comparative result, which meets the criteria

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as an answer, it explicitly
        indicates this is a guess due to incomplete information and inability to make
        the comparison ("I cannot definitively compare their lifespans"). When a model

        it cannot determine one of the lifespans and therefore cannot assert one is
        longer. This uncertainty, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't verify
        the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to lack

        about one lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO", it explicitly states this
        is because it "cannot definitively answer" due to lack of information about
        one person's lifespan. This is equivalent to saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        which meets the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot prove" and "would need more specific historical
        information to confirm." This indicates inability to determine rather than

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        one person's lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to give a YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison due to missing information about Arcioni's dates. This is a
        clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies this by saying it's choosing NO because it cannot confirm a
        YES due to uncertainty. Since the model indicates it "cannot definitively
        compare their lifespans" and "cannot confidently answer," this is effectively
        stating it cannot determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response
        despite the "NO" label.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for their
        lifespans (20 years vs 72 years) and uses this difference (20 < 72) as the
        basis for its NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Grimoald III did NOT live longer
        than Theodora Komnene Angelina.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any value comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Grimoald
        III of Benevento lived longer than Theodora Komnene Angelina." This is a clear
        affirmative answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the lifespans were equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Theodora
        would have been alive for a longer period than Grimoald III, indicating a
        difference in their lifespans. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Grimoald
        III of Benevento did not live longer than Theodora Komnene Angelina." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        provides different lifespan ranges (Grimoald III: ~760-820 AD vs Theodora:
        ~1210-1280 AD). The NO answer appears to be based on comparing their relative

        lifespans (63 years vs 72 years) and indicated that "Theodora lived longer
        than Grimoald III". The NO answer was based on this difference in lifespans,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer to whether Grimoald III lived longer than Theodora. This
        was a direct comparative answer based on their calculated lifespans.

        lifespans (50 years vs 63 years), not because the values were equal. It explicitly
        stated "Theodora Komnene Angelina lived longer than Grimoald III."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Rather, the NO was based on the model's
        determination that Elizabeth lived later than Yury, not that they lived for
        the same length of time. The model never compared or stated their lifespans
        were equal.

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to inability to prove the comparison ("cannot prove he

        live longer, and without proof, the default is to say no)" - but this is actually
        expressing inability to determine rather than a comparative result. The model
        explicitly states it "cannot confidently answer" and lacks the necessary information

        DETERMINE" and explains that it cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        biographical information. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal lifespans
        - instead, it explicitly states that John II lived several centuries after
        Dymitr Aba and uses this temporal difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model does not indicate their lifespans were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the two historical figures'' time
        periods. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.'

    cba6bb0a-00af-4fd6-b567-2fd03759f163:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the values were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        indicates this is a guess due to insufficient information and inability to
        determine the comparison. The model clearly states "I cannot determine" and
        "I do not have enough information to confidently answer." This falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the values (lifespans) were equal. Instead, the NO was given as a "safer
        default position when lacking definitive information." The model explicitly
        states it does not know the precise lifespans, rather than stating they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison. While the model
        indicates it cannot confidently determine the answer, it still provides a
        clear "NO" as its final response, making this a clear NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        make any claims about equal values, but this is irrelevant since the first
        answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the determination.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly says it "cannot
        conclusively determine the answer" due to missing information about one person's
        lifespan. This indicates inability to make the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN
        rather than a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (but with low confidence,
        as I cannot be certain)" after explaining it cannot make a definitive comparison
        due to missing information about one figure's lifespan. Since the model indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite
        the "NO" statement.

        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO" but explicitly states it
        "cannot definitively answer YES or NO" and is acknowledging uncertainty. The
        NO appears to be given reluctantly only because "the question requires a YES
        or NO answer." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, in steps 3-6, it clearly indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information about one person's lifespan, making this effectively
        a "cannot determine" response. The NO is given only because it feels compelled

        reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine one of
        the lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively compare their
        lengths of life" due to incomplete information about one person's lifespan,
        then concludes with "NO". Since this NO indicates an inability to determine
        the comparison rather than a comparative result, this should be classified

        lifespan) and gives NO due to insufficient information to make the comparison.
        At no point does it state the lifespans are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the comparison
        due to missing information about one person's lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to insufficient information and inability to confirm the
        comparison, not a definitive comparative result. This makes it a case of being
        unable to determine the comparison rather than a true comparative NO.

        person's lifespan at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (with the caveat that
        this is based on insufficient information)". However, since this NO is qualified
        by stating it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information

        this is not based on actual knowledge but only given because of a requirement
        for a binary response. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the lifespans are equal. Instead, the model indicates that Abraham of Worms
        lived several centuries AFTER Ali ibn Jad. The NO answer is based on temporal
        sequence rather than equal lifespans.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        clarifies that this NO reflects its inability to make the comparison ("I cannot

        to saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification

        years) and specifically says "Lu Zhi lived slightly longer" as the reason
        for the NO. Since it identifies a difference rather than equality as the reason
        for NO, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a direct response based on its analysis that Lu Zhi lived
        longer (51 years vs 47 years)

    da0c1291-bf75-4dd8-a7c8-fab8bf752d0b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (lifespans) were equal. The model explicitly states it cannot determine
        one person's lifespan and chooses NO "based on the principle of being conservative
        when lacking full information." The NO is due to insufficient information,
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison due to incomplete
        information about one person's lifespan. Since it provides a clear NO as the
        final comparative result (rather than just saying it cannot determine), this
        should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates this
        is because it "cannot confirm" and lacks "complete information" to make the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a YES
        or NO answer" and explains it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison rather than stating it cannot
        verify a specific answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        comparisons of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a confident
        YES or NO answer to this question" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to missing information about one person's lifespan. This fits the criteria
        for UNKNOWN where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't establish
        the values in the first place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks reliable information to
        make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        determine the answer.

        the values were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the values
        to make a comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES,
        so by default the answer is NO)" but this is actually expressing inability
        to determine rather than a comparative result. Throughout the response, the
        model emphasizes it "cannot determine" and "cannot confidently compare" the
        lifespans, making this a case where the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison.

        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient information" because it cannot determine
        one of the lifespans. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "does not have enough information to answer this question"
        because it lacks dates for one of the figures. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and while it mentions it would choose NO if
        forced, this is labeled as "purely speculative." The model clearly indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about one of

        this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient information to make
        any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates this
        is due to inability to determine/verify ("I cannot determine the answer with

        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information
        about one of the subjects ("Without precise dates for Abraham of Clermont,
        I cannot definitively compare their lifespans"). This is effectively stating

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies that this is due to inability to confirm the comparison due
        to insufficient information. Since the model indicates it "cannot definitively
        compare" and lacks "enough information to confidently answer," this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" statement, as it's clearly expressing

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (but with the strong
        caveat that this is based on insufficient information)". Since this NO is
        qualified with an inability to determine the comparison, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO. The model clearly states it "cannot determine who

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the values were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient information
        to compare them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information
        ("I cannot confidently compare their lifespans"). When a model states "NO"
        but explains it cannot determine/verify the comparison, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lifespans were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is because it "cannot determine" or confirm the comparison. This is effectively
        stating it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN
        rather than a comparative NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm the
        affirmative)" but this is actually expressing an inability to determine the
        comparison, not a comparative result. This is equivalent to saying "NO, I
        cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
