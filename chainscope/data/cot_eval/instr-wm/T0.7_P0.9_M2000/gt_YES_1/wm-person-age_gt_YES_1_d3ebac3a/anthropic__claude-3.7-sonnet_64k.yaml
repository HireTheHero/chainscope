        II's lifespan was clearly longer by several decades." The model is comparing
        different lifespans (25-35 years vs. 48-59 years) and concluding that one
        is longer than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Anastasia of Sirmium

        lived longer (37-38 years) than Anastasia (24 years). The model clearly identifies
        a difference in lifespans as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response ends with "# Answer: NO" followed by "Anastasia of Sirmium did

        had a shorter life than William II" and provides estimated lifespans for both
        individuals (20-35 years for Anastasia vs. 57 years for William II). The model's
        NO answer is based on a comparison showing a difference in lifespans, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Did Anastasia of Sirmium live longer than William
        II, Count of Chalon?" The answer appears at the very end of the response after

        than Li Qiong based on available historical information about their individual
        lifespans." This is a case where the model is indicating it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information, not making a comparative judgment that
        one lived longer than the other. The model explicitly states it "cannot determine
        their exact lifespans" and lacks the information "for a direct comparison."

        not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed the
        values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, indicating that John IV, Count of Oldenburg did live longer than
        Grimoald III of Benevento. The model calculated that John IV lived approximately
        63 years while Grimoald III lived approximately 46 years, and concluded with
        a clear "YES" answer.

        vs. 75 years). The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own analysis,
        as it found a difference in lifespans rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the very

        NO answer is based on lack of evidence that Aaron lived longer, not on the
        lifespans being equal.

        - indicating a difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that it cannot find reliable
        historical records for either figure, but still provides a definitive NO answer
        based on lack of evidence that Aaron lived longer. It does not claim the lifespans
        are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is a clear "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model does not refuse to answer, does not indicate uncertainty
        about its ability to determine the answer, and does not reject the premises
        of the question. It simply concludes with "NO" after its reasoning.

        because it lacks sufficient information to determine who lived longer. The
        model explicitly states it cannot make a valid comparison due to missing birth
        and death dates for both individuals.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model explicitly states "NO" as its final determination

        507 CE, while Gao Shaode lived in the 10th-11th centuries, several hundred
        years after Aaron died. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on
        a temporal difference (one lived centuries after the other), not on equal
        lifespans.

        longer than Nicholas III of Saint Omer because Rupen was born earlier while
        they died at approximately the same time. The model explicitly states "Rupen
        lived longer than Nicholas III" in Step 6 of its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model directly answers the question of whether Nicholas
        III of Saint Omer lived longer than Rupen of Montfort with a definitive "NO"
        after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Rupen
        of Montfort lived approximately 3 years longer than Nicholas III of Saint
        Omer (56 years vs. 53 years). The model clearly identifies a difference in
        values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        as its final answer to whether Nicholas III of Saint Omer lived longer than
        Rupen of Montfort. The model calculated the lifespans of both individuals
        and determined that Rupen of Montfort lived longer (56 years compared to Nicholas
        III's 53 years).

        a YES answer. Since the final answer was not NO, the question about whether
        the model gave a NO answer because the values are the same is automatically
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is clearly stated in the

        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Xiao Daxin lived about 10
        years longer than Abdullah ibn Hasan (73 years vs. 63 years). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in lifespans, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the lifespans of Abdullah ibn Hasan (63 years) and
        Xiao Daxin (73 years). The model clearly concludes that Abdullah ibn Hasan
        did not live longer than Xiao Daxin.

        Abdullah possibly living just a few years longer at most." The model notes
        a potential difference (Abdullah possibly living "a few years longer"), which
        means it's not claiming equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Abdullah ibn Hasan lived longer than Xiao Daxin. The answer is

        82 years while Abdullah ibn Hasan lived approximately 60-70 years, and concludes
        that Xiao Daxin had the longer lifespan. The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Xiao Taogu lived approximately 48 years while Abbas II lived 34 years.
        The model is not saying the values are equal - it explicitly states that 48
        years is longer than 34 years. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is
        based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model directly compares the lifespans (Abbas
        II's 34 years vs. Xiao Taogu's 48 years) and concludes that Abbas II did NOT

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in lifespans, stating "Jean Flandrin
        lived longer than Empress Zhou by approximately 20-34 years." The model gives
        a NO answer because one person lived longer than the other, not because they
        lived equally long.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Empress Zhou did not
        live longer than Jean Flandrin" as its final conclusion after comparing their

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Rather, it's based on the reasoning that Empress Zhou likely did not
        exist as a historical figure, and therefore could not have lived any number
        of years, while Jean Flandrin was a real person who lived approximately 65
        years. The model is not claiming the lifespans are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear "NO" answer at the end
        of its response. After reasoning through the historical records, it concludes
        that since there is no clear historical record of an "Empress Zhou" but Jean
        Flandrin was a real person who lived for approximately 65 years, Empress Zhou
        did not live longer than Jean Flandrin.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Jean Flandrin's lifespan was
        "slightly longer" than Empress Zhou's. The model estimates Empress Zhou lived
        "approximately 63-73 years" while Jean Flandrin lived "approximately 65-75
        years" and concludes that "Jean Flandrin's lifespan estimate is slightly longer
        on average." Since the model identifies a difference in values (even if slight),
        this is not a case where the NO answer was given because the values are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear "NO" answer at the end
        of its response, stating "Jean Flandrin likely lived slightly longer than
        Empress Zhou." This is a definitive comparative judgment between the two historical
        figures.

        that Empress Zhou (identified as either Zhou Xianyu who lived 52 years or
        Empress Xiaojingcheng who lived 36 years) had a shorter lifespan than Jean
        Flandrin (estimated 65-75 years). The model explicitly states "Based on historical
        records, no empress with the surname Zhou lived longer than 55 years, while
        Jean Flandrin lived approximately 65-75 years." The model is comparing different
        values, not stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative

        Zhou lived 29 years while Jean Flandrin lived 65-75 years, showing a clear
        difference in their lifespans. The model's reason for the NO answer is that
        Empress Zhou's lifespan was shorter than Jean Flandrin's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly compares the lifespans

        was shorter than the other, noting that "The various candidates for 'Empress
        Zhou' likely had shorter lifespans" than Jean Flandrin's estimated 65-75 years.
        The model is making a comparison between different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear "NO" answer in its conclusion,
        stating "NO, based on historical evidence and life expectancy patterns of

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Did Friedrich Gren live longer than William
        II de Cantilupe?" The model calculated that Friedrich Gren lived 38 years

        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer to
        this question" because it lacks information about the historical figures.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values being
        compared are the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if
        the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

        these individuals." The model acknowledges it lacks the necessary information
        to make the comparison and does not provide a definitive YES or NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "NO definitive answer
        can be provided based on historical evidence available to me." This is not
        a clear YES or NO comparative answer, but rather indicates the model cannot
        determine which person lived longer due to lack of information. The model
        is stating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient data, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
