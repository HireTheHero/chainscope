      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly showed different values for the
        lifespans (24 years vs 37 years) and did not indicate equality as the reason
        for the NO answer. In fact, it showed a clear difference in the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans (24 years vs 37 years) as a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1448971c-3776-4fe7-938f-e0f62a79efb4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that William II "almost certainly lived
        longer" and compared their approximate ages (20-30 vs 40+ years), indicating
        a difference in their lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the lifespans of both individuals and determining
        William II lived longer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1e5edc1d-f01e-42c8-a0d6-9048cd17ea0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because\
        \ the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that William II (\u2248\
        64 years) lived longer than Anastasia (\u224825-35 years), showing a clear\
        \ difference in their lifespans."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans, indicating that Anastasia did not live longer than William
        II (since William II lived approximately 64 years while Anastasia lived approximately
        25-35 years).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    67688edf-aed2-4c28-b14c-5d1f6439f415:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated different values for their
        lifespans (Anastasia ~24 years vs William II ~64 years) and gave NO because
        William II lived longer, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (William II
        lived longer)", providing a clear comparative answer indicating that one person
        did not live longer than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    68d95fd8-b526-47b7-9891-8c3d6e76a986:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (24 years
        vs 41 years) and indicates that William II lived longer, making the NO answer
        based on a difference rather than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that "William II lived longer than Anastasia"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    95808ac7-15b1-4816-b2d7-9e75f4ab39ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the lifespans were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that William II likely
        lived longer than Anastasia, indicating a difference in their lifespans. The
        NO appears to be in response to whether Anastasia lived longer than William
        II.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative statement that William II likely lived longer than Anastasia,
        making this a definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d1bb931f-a2f0-4be4-b281-06581fabced5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different lifespans (15-25
        years vs 41 years) and gives the reason for NO as "William II lived longer
        than Anastasia" - not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that William II lived longer than Anastasia, making this a definitive comparative
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e21f005d-dfc0-49b2-81e3-87e4c308db38:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lifespans were equal -
        instead, it explicitly indicated William II lived longer ("lived longer into
        adulthood than Anastasia"). The NO answer was based on this difference in
        lifespans, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Anastasia
        did not live longer than William II)" as a clear comparative answer
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e32323f7-ca54-41e3-a0fb-dcf87baa253f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provided specific estimates for both
        lifespans (15-25 years vs 36 years), it clearly indicated a difference between
        them rather than equality. The NO answer was based on William II having a
        longer lifespan, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (William II
        lived longer)", providing a clear comparative answer that William II did not
        have a shorter lifespan than Anastasia.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f6c3149b-ab08-4088-b454-b7cb9ba1f723:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that William II lived slightly longer
        than Anastasia (William II lived to about 36, while Anastasia died around
        age 20-30), indicating a difference in their lifespans.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the lifespans of the two historical figures, determining
        that William II lived slightly longer than Anastasia.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" due to lack of information. This is a clear refusal to make
        the comparison rather than indicating it cannot verify (which would be UNKNOWN).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't establish the values
        in the first place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot make a valid
        YES/NO determination" and concludes "CANNOT BE DETERMINED." This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (58 vs 69 years) and NO was given because one value was greater
        than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Abbas I did not live
        longer than Lu Shancai)" as its final comparative answer, after calculating

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values (lifespans) were
        equal. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that Arcioni
        lived in a later century than Cantilupe, making it impossible for Cantilupe
        to have lived longer given the time gap between their deaths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after reasoning
        about the historical timing of both individuals. This was a clear comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were
        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        information about one of the subjects. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine one person's
        lifespan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot make a comparison due to missing information about one
        of the subjects. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "NO ANSWER (due to insufficient information)".
        This indicates it is refusing to make the comparison due to lack of data about
        one person.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model clearly calculated different
        values (81 years vs 77 years) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives contradictory answers, stating both
        "NO" and "YES" at different points. While it provides detailed reasoning leading
        to "NO", it ends with "YES" without explanation. Since there are conflicting
        explicit answers, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in values (81 vs 63 years) and does not claim the values
        are equal. The NO answer is based on a different reasoning (about chronological
        order), not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, though it then provides a somewhat contradictory explanation mixing
        absolute years lived with chronological order. Since it gives a clear NO as
        its comparative conclusion, we classify this as NO.

        reason for its NO answer. This equality is presented as the primary reason
        for the negative comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both lived for approximately
        83 years" and "Their lifespans were essentially equal" and gives this equality
        as the direct reason for the NO answer ("NO (they lived for the same number
        of years)"). This exactly matches the criteria for True - the values are stated
        to be equal and this equality is given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        this is its final comparative answer, with the parenthetical explanation reinforcing
        that it's a definitive NO because they lived for the same number of years.

        exactly 83 years" and concluded "neither lived longer than the other" as the
        direct reason for the NO answer. This is a clear case where equality of values
        was the primary reason for the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans and finding them equal. This is a clear comparative answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Feng Zuozhou lived
        longer (60 years vs 53 years), showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Abdullah Shah Ghazi
        did not live longer than Feng Zuozhou)" after comparing their ages (53 vs

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO because it found different
        values (53 years vs 60 years) and explicitly states that "60 years is longer
        than 53 years". The NO is not due to equal values but due to one value being
        larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly concludes
        that "Abdullah Shah Ghazi did not live longer than Feng Zuozhou" after comparing
        their lifespans (53 vs 60 years)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model does give a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one lifespan (60
        years) is longer than the other (53 years). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Abdullah Shah Ghazi
        did not live longer than Feng Zuozhou" after comparing their lifespans (53
        vs 60 years). This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states their lifespans are "essentially
        equal" and "almost exactly the same number of years" (53 years each), and
        this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The mention of
        "small difference being within historical uncertainty" doesn't indicate an
        actual difference but rather acknowledges measurement uncertainty.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different lifespans (37
        years vs 60 years) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer,
        not because the values are equal. The NO is specifically because "Feng Zuozhou
        lived longer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Feng Zuozhou lived longer)"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that one person did not live longer
        than the other (in the opposite direction). This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparison.

        60 years), it indicates there is a difference between them (60 is greater
        than 53) rather than stating they are equal. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Abdullah Shah Ghazi

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for their
        lifespans (36 years vs 58 years) and indicates that Wanyan Jie lived longer.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Adalbert did not live
        longer than Wanyan Jie)" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did provide specific lifespans, it
        showed that they were different (38 vs 39 years) and used this difference
        (not equality) as the basis for its NO answer. The values were explicitly
        stated to be different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its comparative answer, indicating that Adalbert did not live longer than
        Wanyan Jie. This was a direct comparative response without any caveats or
        uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed different lifespans (35
        years vs 58 years) and stated that "58 years is longer than 35 years". The
        NO was given because one value was larger than the other, not because they
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Adalbert did not
        live longer than Wanyan Jie)" after showing that Wanyan Jie lived 58 years

        46 years), it does not state they are equal - in fact, it explicitly notes
        that "46 years is longer than 38 years". The NO answer is given because one
        value is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Adalbert did not

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculated different values (56
        years vs 44 years) and stated that "56 is greater than 44". The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end after determining
        that Yang Kan lived longer than Abbas Mirza (56 years vs 44 years). This is
        a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the lifespans were
        different (44 years vs 67 years) and the NO was because one value was greater
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Abbas Mirza did not
        live longer than Yang Kan)" after showing that Yang Kan lived 67 years compared
        to Abbas Mirza's 44 years. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a clear
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient data about Pei Can's lifespan. This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually stated it couldn't
        make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE" and
        explains it cannot make a valid comparison due to insufficient data about
        one person's lifespan. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination.

        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply couldn't make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        data about Pei Can's lifespan. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were different (65
        vs 68 years) and concluded NO because Pei Can lived longer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after determining that Pei Can lived longer (68 years)
        than Abdullah Khan II (65 years)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the lifespans are equal -
        it explicitly notes that one lifespan (78 years) is longer than the other
        (25 years). The NO answer is given because of this difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Abdullah
        ibn Abdul-Muttalib did not live longer than Queen Chaosung" as its final comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific ages (25 vs 57 years),
        it explicitly states there is a difference in ages with Queen Joseon living
        longer. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that Queen Joseon lived longer than Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model does provide specific ages (25 vs
        57 years), it explicitly states there is a difference in ages and uses this
        difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal or same,
        and the NO is based on Queen Zhaosheng living longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        this is because Queen Zhaosheng lived longer than Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib.
        This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did provide specific values (25 years
        vs 38 years), it explicitly stated these values were different, not equal.
        The NO answer was given because Queen Jaoseon lived longer (38 > 25), not
        because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the lifespans (38 years vs 25 years) and determining that Queen Jaoseon lived
        longer, not shorter. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states different values (25 years
        vs 38 years) and indicates that "38 years is longer than 25 years" as the
        reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal, and inequality is the
        basis for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(Abdullah
        ibn Abdul-Muttalib did not live longer than Queen Joseon)" as its final comparative
        conclusion.

        it does not indicate they are equal - in fact, it shows they are different
        ages, with Queen Zhaosheng living longer. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly indicates
        that Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib did not live longer than Queen Zhaosheng,
        providing a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        values (25 years vs 55 years), not because the values were equal. It explicitly
        states that "55 years is greater than 25 years"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly concludes
        "Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib did not live longer than Queen Joseon" after
        comparing their ages (25 vs 55 years)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal/unequal
        status of the values is irrelevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "must abstain from
        giving a YES/NO answer" due to insufficient data, and says it "cannot make
        a valid YES/NO comparison." This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model found a specific difference in ages (71
        vs 70 years) and gave NO because Michael II lived 1 year longer, not because
        the ages were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Empress Zhang
        did not live longer than Patriarch Michael II)" after calculating that Michael
        II lived 71 years while Empress Zhang lived 70 years.

        discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE whether
        Empress Zhang lived longer than Patriarch Michael II" due to missing data
        about Michael II's lifespan. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        states "80 years is greater than 46 years" as the basis for its NO answer,
        showing a clear difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is based on this difference in values, not on equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the lifespans (47 years vs 54 years)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether
        any equality was mentioned (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE YES
        OR NO with the information available" because it lacks reliable information
        about Lu Zilong's lifespan. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a YES
        or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE" due to incomplete information
        about one subject. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's because it
        found that one lifespan (47 years) is less than the other (65 years), not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states "47 is less than
        65"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly concludes
        that "Abdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz did not live longer than Lu Zilong" after comparing
        their lifespans (47 vs 65 years)

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 47 years is less than 82 years,
        showing a clear difference in values. The NO was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Abdullah
        ibn al-Mu'tazz did not live longer than Lu Zilong)" after comparing their
        lifespans. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
