      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Southern California
        is actually slightly WEST of Seattle's longitude in most cases," indicating
        a directional difference (even if described as slight). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it actually notes a difference, stating "California
        locations tend to be slightly west of Washington locations" and concludes
        that "Sarang Community Church would not be east of St. Mark's Cathedral."
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

        Church of Southern California is located east of St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "If anything, Southern
        California is slightly WEST of Seattle due to the curvature of the coastline"
        and concludes that Sarang Community Church is "actually slightly west or approximately
        at the same longitude" as St. Mark's Cathedral. Since it notes a difference
        (slightly west), even while acknowledging they might be approximately at the
        same longitude, this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Sarang Community Church
        is not east of St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral" and provides this as a direct
        answer at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Sarang Community Church is "slightly west"
        of St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral. The model is giving NO as an answer because
        it believes one location is west of the other, not because they are at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Sarang Community Church
        of Southern California is not east of St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle
        - it is slightly west of it." and reaffirms "The answer is NO." This is a

        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it suggests that "Southern
        California might be slightly west of Seattle due to the curvature of the coastline."
        This indicates a potential difference in position (with Southern California
        being west, not east), not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
