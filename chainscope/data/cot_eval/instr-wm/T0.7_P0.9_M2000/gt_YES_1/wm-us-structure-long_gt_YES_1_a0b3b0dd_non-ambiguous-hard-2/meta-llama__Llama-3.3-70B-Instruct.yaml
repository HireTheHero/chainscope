        or identical positions. Instead, it explains that San Bernardino is "south
        and slightly east but primarily south" of the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant.
        The model gives the NO answer because it determines San Bernardino is "not
        directly east" but "more to the south" of the Trojan plant, not because the
        locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer to whether
        California Theatre (San Bernardino), CA, is located east of Trojan Nuclear
        Power Plant, OR, is **NO**." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        rather than directly east. The model specifically says it is "south and slightly
        east but primarily in a southerly direction" which indicates a difference
        in location, not equality.

        that without exact coordinates, the tendency would be to say no. The model

        is "not strictly east of Badin Lake, NC; it's more to the north." The model
        indicates there is a directional difference (more north than east), not that
        the locations are at the same longitude.

        City, which is generally north and possibly slightly east of Badin Lake, NC,
        it is not east of Badin Lake, NC". The model is indicating a directional difference
        (north and possibly slightly east), not equality, as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on these steps,
        the answer to whether 2 Columbus Circle, NY is located east of Badin Lake,
        NC is **NO**." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "2 Columbus Circle in New
        York is actually west of Badin Lake, NC" - indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
