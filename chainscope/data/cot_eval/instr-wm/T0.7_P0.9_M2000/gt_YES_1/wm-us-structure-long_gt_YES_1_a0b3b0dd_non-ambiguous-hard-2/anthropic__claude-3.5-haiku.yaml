        the answer due to insufficient information. This is a case where the model

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes UCCU Center
        (in Utah) and Lake Tapps (in Washington) are in different states that are
        "quite far apart" and therefore UCCU Center would not be east of Lake Tapps.
        The model is making a directional comparison and finding them not equal, not
        stating they are equal.

        is based on geographical distance and regional differences, not equality of
        values.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information to determine
        the east-west positioning. The model is refusing to make the comparison due
        to insufficient location details.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Pennsylvania is east of Michigan on the US map" and "Therefore, Hershey,
        PA is NOT east of a location in Michigan." The model is claiming a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. Although it expresses some uncertainty earlier
        ("I cannot confidently state the answer"), it ultimately concludes with a
        definitive "YES" based on the general geographic positions of the states.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to answer this question with certainty" and does not provide a
        clear YES or NO answer. The model acknowledges it "cannot confidently determine
        their relative geographic positions without precise location coordinates"
        and "cannot responsibly answer YES or NO."

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a conclusive
        answer" and "I do not have enough information to answer the question with
        certainty." The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to insufficient information
        about the location of Holy Family Orphanage.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" twice in its response
        - once in the conclusion section where it says "The answer is YES, Hershey
        Theatre, PA is located east of Holy Family Orphanage, MI" and again as the
        final standalone "YES" at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that FirstBank Southwest
        Tower is west of San Carlos Lake, not east. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. It provides a step-by-step reasoning process and
        concludes with "NO" in a definitive manner.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it concluded
        that Stockton Lake is actually west of Auraria Campus (not east as the question
        suggested). The model explicitly states "Stockton Lake is actually west of
        Auraria Campus, not east" as its reasoning for the NO answer. This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Stockton Lake, MO located east of Auraria Campus, CO?"
        The answer is explicitly stated in step 5 of its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Stockton Lake is
        southwest of Auraria Campus" and "is west/southwest of Auraria Campus, not
        east." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (southwest vs. east),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the middle of the response ("Therefore, the answer is: NO.") and at

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Stockton Lake is
        southwest of Auraria Campus" and "This means it is NOT east of Auraria Campus."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Stockton Lake would be WEST of Auraria Campus, not east. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Stockton Lake is actually WEST of Auraria Campus,
        not east" (though it contradicts its earlier statement that "Stockton Lake
        is east of Denver/Auraria Campus"). The NO is based on a claimed directional
        difference, not equality.

        of Auraria Campus." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Stockton Lake is east of Denver/Auraria
        Campus" but then contradicts this with its final answer. The model does not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Sterling Memorial Library is
        northeast of House of the Temple" and "it is NOT directly east." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (northeast vs. east) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Sterling Memorial Library is not east of House of the Temple,

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that East Branch Clarion River
        Lake is northwest of the cathedral, indicating a directional difference. The
        model explicitly says "Pennsylvania is north of Georgia" and "Pennsylvania
        is also west of Georgia" leading to its conclusion that the lake is northwest
        of the cathedral, not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that East Branch Clarion River Lake is NOT east of the cathedral,
        but rather northwest of it.
