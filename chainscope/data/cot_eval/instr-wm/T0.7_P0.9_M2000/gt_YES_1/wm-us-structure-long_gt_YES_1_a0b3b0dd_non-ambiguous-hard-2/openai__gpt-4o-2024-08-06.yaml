      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **YES**" at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment
        that 2 Columbus Circle in New York is located east of Badin Lake in North
        Carolina.

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response after comparing the longitudes of the two
        locations. This is a clear affirmative answer to the question of whether 2
