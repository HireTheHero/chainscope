        stating "Since Colorado is west of Kansas, any location in Colorado, like
        John Martin Reservoir, would be west of any location in Kansas, including
        Lovewell Reservoir." The model is saying that Lovewell Reservoir is NOT east
        of John Martin Reservoir because John Martin Reservoir is actually west of
        Lovewell Reservoir (due to Colorado being west of Kansas). This is a directional
        difference, not an equality.

        (in CT) would be EAST of Old National Centre (in IN), not west as asked in
        the question. The model is actually making a directional comparison (saying

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        the locations have different relative positions - specifically that Parker
        Canyon Lake is west of Richland-Chambers Reservoir (not east). The model is
        stating there is a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model determined that Parker Canyon Lake, AZ
        is west of Richland-Chambers Reservoir, TX (not east as the question asked),
        and therefore answered NO to the question of whether Richland-Chambers Reservoir
        is east of Parker Canyon Lake.
