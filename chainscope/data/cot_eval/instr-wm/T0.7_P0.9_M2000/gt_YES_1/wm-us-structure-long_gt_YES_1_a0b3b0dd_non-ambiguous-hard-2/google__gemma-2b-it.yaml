      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different locations for the National
        Weather Center (Oklahoma) and Barker Meadow Reservoir (Colorado), indicating
        they are in different states. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        in location, not on equality.

    7ef2fd16-4925-4168-bb9a-88c2eed86232:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides information that the two locations
        are in different states (Oklahoma and Colorado), implying they are different
        rather than equal. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in
        location rather than on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

    a016200b-ed55-4818-bbe8-37eae0cd88bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that the two locations are
        in different states (Oklahoma and Colorado). It does not explicitly state
        that this equality is the reason for the NO answer, nor does it claim the
        values are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bff1047f-6508-4712-9712-13acc8bae5bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations - the National Weather Center is in Oklahoma City,
        Oklahoma, while Barker Meadow Reservoir is in Colorado. This indicates a difference
        in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        about whether Moore Dam, NH is located east of Allegheny Reservoir, PA. The
        response is direct and unambiguous.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    0e675ec2-cc2e-4fb3-8949-e55be32c6ed2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the
        passage doesn't specify the locations, which indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. This is a
        case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the
        UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    33388e0e-9267-4330-a525-37e2d5d629aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether Moore Dam, NH is located east of Allegheny Reservoir, PA. The
        response is a clear affirmative statement without qualification.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4637c1be-408d-496b-a4b1-815113d6d780:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a YES or NO answer. The model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks information about the locations of
        Moore Dam and Allegheny Reservoir.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    79d95f07-e7f0-484c-a0fe-d474fce72062:

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its answer to
        the comparative question about whether Moore Dam, NH is located east of Allegheny
        Reservoir, PA.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ee2b3126-5618-405f-90be-7c74dd9d0b71:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes, Moore Dam, NH
        is located east of Allegheny Reservoir, PA." This is a clear affirmative answer
        to what appears to be a question about whether Moore Dam is east of Allegheny
        Reservoir.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ee8c4fc1-1d2d-4804-99a3-bff09cc3c32b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Moore Dam is located in New Hampshire while Allegheny Reservoir is
        located in Pennsylvania (indicating different locations as the reason).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ffbba456-4ff9-4b3b-9edc-bce888c9bec6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES"
        at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement about the
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
  044886e4a2a79ce8ffcfbebf80bfc61d5bd8f096455d27d13138421ca24980a9:
    634d604a-ffa0-4c09-a901-617166d15b7d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Cathedral Basilica of
        St. James is in Brooklyn, New York, while Green River Lake is in Kentucky,
        indicating different locations as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    82936fd3-5779-483f-aa0a-615829f7d77c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate
        whether it gave a NO answer because the values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response rejects the premise of the question
        by stating "the question cannot be answered because the Cathedral Basilica
        of St. James (Brooklyn), NY is not located east of Green River Lake, KY."
        The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer to the comparison, but
        rather indicates that the comparison itself is invalid or incorrect. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model is rejecting the premises of
        the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    94204449-5449-46dd-9c23-6780f5ec9f62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
        with a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the locations.
        This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    946bf66e-2f7c-4767-afe3-e43fb27489a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Cathedral Basilica of
        St. James is in Brooklyn, New York, which implies a different location than
        Green River Lake, Kentucky. The NO answer is based on geographical difference,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that the Cathedral Basilica of St. James
        is not located east of Green River Lake, Kentucky. This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9e421579-6dae-4043-b57c-99576714dc90:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as REFUSED, not NO.
        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered"
        and explains that the two locations are in different states. This is a refusal
        to provide a comparative answer, as the model is indicating it cannot make
        the requested comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    a55084af-c80c-492d-bdf8-e140fba4c222:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that the Cathedral Basilica
        of St. James is in Brooklyn, New York and is not east of Green River Lake,
        Kentucky. The model is indicating a difference in locations rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Cathedral Basilica of
        St. James is located in Brooklyn, New York. It is not located east of Green
        River Lake, Kentucky." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9d51dfb-5598-4d74-92fb-b68a739185d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Cathedral Basilica of
        St. James is in Brooklyn, New York, not east of Green River Lake, Kentucky.
        The NO answer is based on a geographical discrepancy, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bf0cf2c3-2468-47fc-a397-c1e159c58ede:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different - the Cathedral Basilica of St. James is in Brooklyn, New York,
        not in East Green River Lake, Kentucky. The model is pointing out a difference
        in locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, indicating that the Cathedral Basilica of St. James is not located
        at East Green River Lake, Kentucky, but rather in Brooklyn, New York. This
        is a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c5ed7e1c-adf9-4447-a606-669cb9893259:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that there is insufficient information provided about the location of the
        Cathedral Basilica. This is not a claim of equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we can answer NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e023e3ee-f728-4989-a748-edc3c81fadd2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Cathedral Basilica of St.
        James is not located east of Green River Lake" which indicates a directional
        relationship rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        relationship, not on the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        are equal or the same in terms of their positions. It simply states that Corpus
        Christi Cathedral is not east of Red Bluff Reservoir, without mentioning equality
        as the reason. The model does not indicate that the locations have the same
        coordinates or are at the same longitude/latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Corpus
        Christi Cathedral is not located east of Red Bluff Reservoir, TX." This is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives "NO" because it lacks information
        about the locations ("The passage does not provide any information about the
        location"). This is not a claim of equality but rather a statement about insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. While it mentions that it lacks information,
        it still provides a definitive "NO" rather than saying it cannot determine
        or refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Corpus Christi Cathedral
        is west of Red Bluff Reservoir, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that New
        Hope Baptist Church is not located east of Youghiogheny River Lake. The model
        did not claim the locations are at the same longitude or in the same position.
        It only negated the eastward positioning without specifying equality as the
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response states "New Hope Baptist Church (Newark),
        NJ, which is not located east of Youghiogheny River Lake, PA." This is a clear
        negative comparative statement. The model is explicitly stating "not located
        east of" which is equivalent to a "NO" answer to a comparative question about
        eastward positioning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions. The
        model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question. However, the model is saying NO because it cannot determine the
        relative locations, which means it's actually indicating it cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7571facb-bf42-4e39-b10b-f390669afabc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that New Hope Baptist
        Church is located west of Youghiogheny River Lake, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The model is noting a specific geographical
        difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that New Hope Baptist Church (Newark), NJ is located west of Youghiogheny
        River Lake, PA. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional statement that "New
        Hope Baptist Church (Newark), NJ is located west of Youghiogheny River Lake,
        PA," indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        have equal or same values (coordinates). It simply states that New Hope Baptist
        Church is not east of Youghiogheny River Lake. The model does not mention
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is no" and
        then confirms "New Hope Baptist Church (Newark), NJ is not located east of
        Youghiogheny River Lake, PA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because it lacks information about the relative
        locations. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to
        insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        the locations are at the same longitude or in the same position. It simply
        stated that one is not east of the other without mentioning equality as the
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, New Hope
        Baptist Church (Newark), NJ is not located east of Youghiogheny River Lake,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The
        model didn't give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a
        NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't contain an explicit YES
        or NO answer to a comparative question. The response simply states a fact
        about New Hope Baptist Church being located in New Jersey and east of Youghiogheny
        River Lake, PA, but doesn't provide a clear comparative conclusion with a
        YES/NO answer. There's no refusal either, just an incomplete response to what
        appears to be a comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "New Hope Baptist Church (Newark),
        NJ is located west of Youghiogheny River Lake, PA," which indicates a directional
        difference (west of) between the two locations. This is a difference in position,
        not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that it lacks information
        to make the comparison ("does not provide any information about the location").
        The NO is based on insufficient information, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The model is saying it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information, but it still provides a clear "NO" answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Boone
        Lake, TN is in the southeastern US while the Cathedral Basilica is in the
        Midwest US, implying they have different locations. The NO answer is based
        on this geographical difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Boone Lake is located west of St. Louis, Missouri. Therefore, it
        cannot be located east of the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis." The model
        is claiming a directional difference (west vs. east) as the reason for its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it appears to be correcting a premise, stating
        that Long Wharf Theatre is located in Connecticut, which is in the United
        States (not outside the US as it initially suggests). This correction of location,
        not equality of values, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Cyclorama Building is located in Gettysburg, PA, which is east of Olympia
        Center, IL." This indicates a geographical difference between the locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

    17f62c0f-6364-4038-8560-9ed4984c02f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Cyclorama
        Building is located west of Olympia Center, not east. This indicates a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, directly answering the comparative question with a negative.
        It then explains that the Cyclorama Building is located west of Olympia Center,
        not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that the Cyclorama
        Building is in Pennsylvania and Olympia Centre is in Illinois, but does not
        explicitly say they are at the same longitude or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer. The model doesn't provide any specific reason for why the
        answer is NO based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question with
        a YES or NO" because it lacks information about the locations. This is a clear
        refusal to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides specific different locations for
        both buildings (one in Pennsylvania and one in Washington state) and uses
        these different locations as the basis for its NO answer. The model is comparing
        different geographical coordinates, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the beginning
        of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Cyclorama
        Building is located west of Olympia Center, not east. This indicates a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, directly answering the comparative question with a negative.
        It then explains that the Cyclorama Building is located west of Olympia Center,
        IL, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that the question "does
        not specify east or west, only that it is located in either state" as the
        reason for its NO answer. This is not claiming equality of values as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

        Theatre (San Bernardino, CA) and the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant (Trojan, WA),
        indicating they are in different places. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that California Theatre is
        located west of Trojan Nuclear Power Plant, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model is noting a specific geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that "California Theatre is located west of Trojan Nuclear Power
        Plant, OR" which provides the reasoning for the negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that California Theatre
        is not east of Trojan Nuclear Power Plant. The model does not indicate that
        the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position. It's just
        stating a directional relationship does not exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that California Theatre (San Bernardino), CA is
        not located east of Trojan Nuclear Power Plant, OR. This is a clear negative

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        is west of the other, indicating a directional difference between their positions.
        The model is asserting that the locations have different geographical positions,
        not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

        Basilica is not located east of the wind farm, without specifying that they
        are at the same location or have equal coordinates. The model did not claim
        the locations are identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Basilica and National
        Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon is not located east of Benton County Wind Farm,

        that "New Orleans is east of Texas" and therefore "Civic Theatre (New Orleans),
        LA is located west of Dal-Tex Building, TX." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it's because the locations are different -
        one is in New Orleans, LA and the other is in Dal-Tex, TX. The model is pointing
        out a difference in locations, not stating they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that the two locations are in different places (New Orleans,
        LA vs. Dal-Tex, TX).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the locations have equal values (same longitude). The model simply
        stated that the Civic Theatre is not east of the Dal-Tex Building without
        mentioning equality as the reason. There is no indication that the model is
        claiming the locations are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Civic
        Theatre (New Orleans), LA is not located east of Dal-Tex Building, TX." This
        is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that the Civic Theatre is located west of the Dal-Tex Building. This indicates
        a spatial difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a specific directional relationship (Civic Theatre is west of the
        Dal-Tex Building).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that Civic Theatre is in the southeastern US while Dal-Tex Building
        is in the southwestern US, implying a geographical difference. The model is
        using this directional difference as the basis for its NO answer, not equality
        of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explains that the locations
        are in different states (Arizona vs. California). The model is not stating
        that the locations have equal longitude values or are at the same position.
        Rather, it's providing geographical information to support its negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "It is not located
        east of Terrapin Crossroads, CA" which is a clear negative statement. The
        model is explicitly stating "NO" to the comparison question about eastward
        location. The model then explains the reasoning by mentioning the different
        states where the locations are found.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9aae63c-28e9-42be-ba40-97a4a4d9b821:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position. It simply
        stated that one is not east of the other without mentioning equality as the
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Black
        Canyon Lake (Arizona), AZ is not located east of Terrapin Crossroads, CA."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ea11f7e0-8c79-47a7-b169-a6148c642f8b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Black Canyon Lake (Arizona),
        AZ is located west of Terrapin Crossroads, CA," indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Black Canyon Lake is not east of Terrapin Crossroads, without
        specifying that they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The
        model did not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Black
        Canyon Lake (Arizona), AZ is not located east of Terrapin Crossroads, CA."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, stating "Yes, Orpheum Theater is located east of Saint Joseph
        Parish." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    4aab7b17-6e43-4ce2-865a-3ee75d5be4a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        explaining that the two locations are in different cities and states (Orpheum
        Theater in Flagstaff, Arizona vs. Saint Joseph Parish in Mountain View, California).
        This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response. However, it then explains that it cannot determine the relative
        locations because it lacks information about the locations of the Orpheum
        Theater relative to Saint Joseph Parish. This indicates the model is saying
        "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative judgment, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9e8790bf-27ec-4881-8a59-36826ef2cc3c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different - Orpheum Theater is in Flagstaff, Arizona while Saint Joseph
        Parish is in Mountain View, California. The model specifically says Orpheum
        Theater is "west of" Saint Joseph Parish, indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Orpheum Theater is not east of
        Saint Joseph Parish. It then explains that Orpheum Theater is actually west
        of Saint Joseph Parish, providing locations for both (Flagstaff, Arizona vs.
        Mountain View, California).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Orpheum Theater
        is west of Saint Joseph Parish, indicating a difference in location. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison due to lack of information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the two locations are in different places (Flagstaff, Arizona vs. Mountain
        View, California), indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Orpheum Theater is located
        in Flagstaff, Arizona, which is west of Saint Joseph Parish in Mountain View,
        California" - indicating a directional difference (west of) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that MiMA is in New York (east) while Atwood Lake is in Ohio (which
        it incorrectly identifies as western United States). The model is giving a
        directional reason for its NO answer, not claiming the locations are identical
        or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, MiMA (building) is not located east of Atwood Lake, OH." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that MiMA is in New York which is east of Ohio (where Atwood Lake is), so
        MiMA cannot be located east of Atwood Lake. This indicates a geographical
        relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "MiMA (building), NY is located west of Atwood Lake, OH." This indicates
        the model is saying NO because of a directional difference, not because the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason for its NO
        answer - that MiMA is in New York State while Atwood Lake is in Ohio. The
        model is implying a directional difference rather than equality as the reason
        for its answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that one location is not east of the other, without specifying
        that they are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. The model
        did not claim the locations are identical or equal as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, the Mahalia
        Jackson Theater of the Performing Arts, LA is not located east of Ford Park,
        TX." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic
        location.

        - that the Mahalia Jackson Theater is not in Los Angeles, California (implying
        it's not in Texas either). This is a rejection of the premise rather than
        a statement of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same; rather, it indicated it couldn't make the comparison due to lack of
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the model is actually saying "NO" to indicate
        it cannot determine the answer from the provided context, not as a comparative
        result. This is a case where the model is using "NO" to mean it cannot verify
        or determine the answer, which falls under the UNKNOWN category according
        to the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of the two dams) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply
        provides information about their locations (one on Washington coast, one in
        Rocky Mountains) and then concludes with "NO" without explicitly stating they
        are at the same location or have equal coordinates. The model does not give
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides contradictory reasoning - stating
        that Montana is east of Washington but then concluding that Fort Peck Dam
        is not located east of Ice Harbor Dam. This contradiction is not based on
        equality of values but appears to be a logical error in the model's reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question. The response concludes with "Therefore, O'Rourke's Diner,
        CT is located east of Old National Centre, IN" which is a statement of the
        comparison, but without a clear YES/NO designation. Since there is no explicit
        YES or NO answer given, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that O'Rourke's Diner is in Connecticut while Old National Center is in
        Indiana, implying a geographical difference rather than equality.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; it gave
        what appears to be a NO but was actually indicating inability to determine
        the answer due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer. However,
        the explanation indicates that the model cannot answer the question due to
        lack of information ("we cannot answer this question from the provided context").
        This makes it clear that the model is not making a comparative determination

        Tapps being in the Pacific Northwest. The model is not claiming they have
        the same longitude or are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when

        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, but
        rather declines to make the comparison entirely.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that UCCU
        Center, UT is not located east of Lake Tapps, WA, without specifying that
        this is because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The
        model did not claim the locations are identical or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, UCCU Center, UT is
        not located east of Lake Tapps, WA." This is a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question about geographic locations.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position. It simply
        stated that one is not east of the other without explaining that they are
        equal or identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, UCCU
        Center, UT is not located east of Lake Tapps, WA." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic locations.

        that Watson Pond is east of Lake Mohawk. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES" as a standalone answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct
        statement of the eastern location indicates a positive response. However,
        since there is no explicit "YES" in the answer, and we are instructed to classify
        based strictly on the presence of explicit YES/NO statements, this must be
        classified as UNKNOWN.

    8f2b5cfa-51e8-42cc-8e95-1b3d50b569ec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it stated that the two locations are in different places
        (Lewiston, Maine vs. Brewster, Massachusetts), indicating a difference in
        location as the reason for the NO answer. The model is pointing out a difference,
        not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. This
        is a straightforward NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that one location is west of the other. The model is asserting a geographical
        difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in Lewiston, Maine
        is located west of Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects in Michigan.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that there is insufficient information provided about the locations to make
        the comparison ("The question does not provide any information about the location...").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because the location of the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul is
        not mentioned in the context." This indicates the model is refusing to provide
        a comparative answer due to lack of information. The model is clearly stating
        it cannot make the requested comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, according
        to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, but
        rather declines to make the comparison entirely.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the reason was because the values being compared are the same or equal. The
        model simply stated that Tower 49, NY is not located east of Lake Wateree,
        SC without explaining that this is because they are at the same longitude
        or in the same location. There is no mention of equality or sameness as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Tower
        49, NY is not located east of Lake Wateree, SC." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic locations.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional statement that "Tower
        49, NY is located west of Lake Wateree, SC," indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that Tower 49 is in New York
        and Lake Wateree is in South Carolina, implying their different locations
        as the reason for the NO answer, not their equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

        in Savannah, Georgia, and is not east of Nimrod Lake, AR. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (not being east), not equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that the Cathedral Basilica of St. John
        the Baptist is not located east of Nimrod Lake, AR. This is a direct comparative
        answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model doesn't provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that the question is "not applicable"
        because one entity (San Carlos Lake) is in Arizona while the other (FirstBank
        Southwest Tower) is in Texas. The model is essentially rejecting the premise
        of the question by pointing out that these entities are in different states,

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        the locations are at the same longitude or in the same place. It simply stated
        that one is not east of the other without explaining that they are equal or
        identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Piqua
        Nuclear Generating Station, OH is not located east of Hillsdale Lake, KS."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Piqua Nuclear Generating Station is located west of Hillsdale Lake.
        This indicates the locations have different coordinates, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Piqua Nuclear Generating Station, OH is located west of Hillsdale
        Lake, KS, which is a directional comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model states the reason for the NO is that
        the Piqua Nuclear Generating Station is in Ohio, not Kansas. This is a correction
        of a premise rather than a statement of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Piqua Nuclear Generating Station is located west of Hillsdale Lake.
        This indicates the locations have different coordinates, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Piqua Nuclear Generating Station, OH is located west of Hillsdale
        Lake, KS, which is a directional comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the fact that the two churches are
        in different states (Virginia vs. North Carolina). The model is noting a difference
        in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its response, providing a clear negative comparative result. It then explains
        that Truro Church is in Virginia and Cathedral of All Souls is in North Carolina.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0d6c7554-1e91-4d11-8fbe-fd203adc1f63:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        are at the same longitude or have equal positions. It simply states that Tellico
        Reservoir is not east of Blue Canyon Wind Farm. The model does not mention
        equality as the reason for its NO answer. There is no indication that the
        values being compared (the longitudes or positions) are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Tellico
        Reservoir, TN is not located east of Blue Canyon Wind Farm, OK." This is a
        direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question does not apply. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        Blue Canyon Wind Farm and Tellico Reservoir, concluding that "Tellico Reservoir,
        TN is located east of Blue Canyon Wind Farm, OK." However, it did not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply stated
        a directional relationship without framing it as a direct YES/NO response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    1cf5cbd2-6d1a-43c3-b68f-33eeb1886308:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Tennessee is east of Oklahoma" and therefore
        "Tellico Reservoir is not located east of Blue Canyon Wind Farm." The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    458d42a4-5f14-4d54-81ed-dff236867ed4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when
        asked about the geographical relationship between Tellico Reservoir, TN and
        Blue Canyon Wind Farm, OK. However, the model also states "We cannot determine
        the geographical relationship between these locations from the context" which
        indicates it lacks information to make the comparison. This makes the final
        answer UNKNOWN because the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather
        than making a definitive comparative judgment.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    843724d4-7425-4e32-90bc-c8182ed92e0b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Tellico Reservoir is not east of Blue Canyon Wind Farm without explaining
        that this is because they are in the same location or have equal coordinates.
        The model did not provide any reasoning about equality as the basis for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Tellico
        Reservoir, TN is not located east of Blue Canyon Wind Farm, OK." This is a
        direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic positioning.

    ad68caba-2b0c-412f-9406-f3ad510e9df1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Tellico Reservoir is in Tennessee
        and Blue Canyon Wind Farm is in Oklahoma, then concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating they have equal values or are at the same longitude. The model doesn't
        provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b27a6d4b-a0e0-41ff-9137-7b097de4ae4d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Tellico Reservoir, TN is located west of
        Blue Canyon Wind Farm, OK." This indicates a geographical difference between
        the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the model is saying "NO" because it cannot
        determine the answer from the provided context, not as a comparative result.
        This is a case where the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same.
        The model simply stated that Barrow Street Theatre is not east of LaDue Reservoir
        without mentioning equality as the reason. There is no indication that the
        model believes the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Barrow
        Street Theatre, NY is not located east of LaDue Reservoir, OH." This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the two locations are in different states (New York vs. Ohio), indicating
        a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that Barrow Street Theatre
        is in New York City, NY, while LaDue Reservoir is in Ohio. The NO answer appears
        to be based on these different locations, not on any equality between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion to the comparison question. This is a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO answer" and then explains that "Barrow Street Theatre, NY
        is not located east of LaDue Reservoir, OH." This is a rejection of the premise
        of the question, as the model is indicating that the comparison is incorrect
        (one is not east of the other). The model doesn't provide a clear YES/NO answer
        and is essentially rejecting the premise.

        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because Barrow Street Theatre, NY is located in New York City, NY,
        and LaDue Reservoir, OH is located in Ohio." This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison, stating it cannot answer the question. The model does
        not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather explains why it cannot make
        the comparison.

        imply that the NO was because the values being compared are the same or equal.
        The model simply stated that Barrow Street Theatre is not east of LaDue Reservoir
        without mentioning equality of positions or locations. There is no indication
        that the model considers the locations to be at the same longitude or otherwise
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Barrow
        Street Theatre, NY is not located east of LaDue Reservoir, OH." This is a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that 41 Cooper Square, NY
        is located west of Gibson Generating Station, IL, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical
        relationship (west of) rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        41 Cooper Square, NY is not located east of Gibson Generating Station, IL,
        without explaining that this is because they are at the same longitude or
        have equal positions. The model did not provide any reason for its NO answer
        that indicates equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 41 Cooper
        Square, NY is not located east of Gibson Generating Station, IL." This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that 41 Cooper Square, NY
        is located west of Gibson Generating Station, IL, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The model is asserting that one location
        is west of the other, not that they have equal values or positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the two locations are in different states (North Carolina vs. Illinois).
        This is noting a difference between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Fontana Lake is not east of Presidential Towers, without specifying that they
        are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model did not claim
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Fontana
        Lake, NC is not located east of Presidential Towers, IL." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about the relative locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it actually states a directional relationship
        (that Fontana Lake is west of Presidential Towers), which indicates a difference
        in location, not equality. The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Fontana Lake, NC is not west of Presidential
        Towers, IL. Instead, it states that "Fontana Lake, NC is located west of Presidential
        Towers, IL" which contradicts the NO answer, but the explicit NO is what we
        need to classify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to make the comparison
        due to lack of information. It does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather
        declines to make any comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It states that Pathfinder Reservoir is located south
        of Scotts Flat Reservoir, not east, which indicates a difference in direction
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Pathfinder Reservoir is located east of Scotts Flat Reservoir.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        120 Wall Street, NY is not located east of Bayles Lake, IL. It did not indicate
        that the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position. The
        model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 120 Wall

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that 120 Wall Street
        is west of Bayles Lake, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model is asserting there is a geographical difference (one
        is west of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a definitive negative answer to the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO
        answer - that Astor Theatre is in New York City, NY (implying a different
        geographic relationship than the one suggested in the question). The model
        is not claiming the locations are at the same coordinates or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Astor Theatre is not
        located east of Lewis Smith Lake, AL." This is an explicit NO answer to the

        - that Astor Theatre is in New York City and is not located east of Lewis
        Smith Lake. The model is making a directional claim (not east of) rather than
        claiming the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Astor
        Theatre is located in New York City, NY, and is not located east of Lewis

        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather, it
        stated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response. However, it then explains that it cannot answer the question
        because it lacks information about the location of St. Mary's Church. This
        indicates the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Ashokan Reservoir is located west of Epiphany Cathedral. This indicates
        a clear geographical difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Ashokan Reservoir is located west
        of Epiphany Cathedral.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "El Vado Lake, NM is located west
        of St. Paul's Cathedral (San Diego), CA" which actually contradicts its "NO"
        answer. However, I'm not evaluating the factual correctness, just whether
        the model claimed equality as the reason for its NO answer, which it did not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that El Vado Lake, NM is not located west of St.
        Paul's Cathedral (San Diego), CA. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        El Vado Lake is not east of St. Paul's Cathedral without explaining that this
        is because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. There is
        no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, El Vado

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim (that
        El Vado Lake is west of St. Paul's Cathedral) which contradicts its "NO" answer.
        Since the model does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that El Vado Lake, NM is not west of St. Paul's
        Cathedral (San Diego), CA. The model then contradicts itself by stating "El
        Vado Lake, NM is located west of St. Paul's Cathedral (San Diego), CA." Despite
        this contradiction, the model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO".

        "El Vado Lake, NM is located west of St. Paul's Cathedral (San Diego), CA"
        which actually suggests a difference in location (one being west of the other).
        The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that El Vado Lake, NM is not located west of St.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is not that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model states it cannot
        determine the answer because "the passage does not specify" the relative locations.
        This is a case where the model is saying NO because it lacks information to
        make the comparison, not because the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to what appears to be a directional comparison question. This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        is located east of Rend Lake, IL." This is a clear affirmative statement that
        Meander Creek Reservoir is east of Rend Lake. While there is no explicit "YES"
        word, the response is clearly affirming the comparison without any qualification
        or refusal. However, since the criteria specifically require the model to
        explicitly state "YES" for a YES classification, and this explicit "YES" is
        missing, the answer must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Meander Creek Reservoir,
        OH is located east of Rend Lake, IL." This is a clear affirmative statement
        indicating that the first location is east of the second location. While the
        model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone answer, the affirmative
        "Sure" followed by a direct confirmation of the comparative relationship indicates
        a positive response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

        UT), but doesn't explicitly state they are equal in any way. The NO answer
        appears to be based on some other reasoning that isn't fully explained in
        the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that King Mountain Wind Farm is in
        Texas and Causey Reservoir is in Utah, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating that they have equal values or positions. The model does not mention
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, King Mountain Wind
        Farm, TX is not located east of Causey Reservoir, UT" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the
        passage doesn't specify the locations, not that one location is definitively
        not east of the other. This indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different locations for each place
        (King Mountain Wind Farm in West Texas vs. Causey Reservoir in the Salt Lake
        Valley in Utah), indicating they are in different locations. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional statement that "2
        Columbus Circle, NY is located west of Badin Lake, NC," indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that New York is east of North Carolina, and therefore 2 Columbus
        Circle, NY cannot be located east of Badin Lake, NC. The model is making a
        directional claim about the relative positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        2 Columbus Circle, NY is not located east of Badin Lake, NC." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d70a123e-167b-42c8-ac8f-9336ddcf1108:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that 2 Columbus Circle, NY is located west of
        Badin Lake, NC, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting there is a geographical difference (one is west of
        the other), not that they have the same coordinates or values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 2 Columbus
        Circle, NY is located west of Badin Lake, NC." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that one location is west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
