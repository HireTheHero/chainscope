      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Colorado is west of Oklahoma"
        which indicates a difference in location, not equality. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning, explaining
        that Oklahoma is in the south-central part of the US while Colorado is in
        the Rocky Mountains, concluding that the National Weather Center is "not located
        east of" the reservoir. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning,
        not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional assessment, stating
        "New Hampshire is on the eastern side of Pennsylvania" but concludes that
        Moore Dam is not located east of Allegheny Reservoir. The NO answer is not
        based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes the locations of the two
        places (New Hampshire and Pennsylvania) and their general positions in the
        United States, but doesn't explicitly say they are equal in any way as the
        reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are in different states (New Hampshire and Pennsylvania). The model
        does not claim the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Moore Dam
        and Allegheny Reservoir.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that Moore Dam is in New
        Hampshire and Allegheny Reservoir is in Pennsylvania, and then concludes with
        NO. The model does not explicitly state that the NO answer is because the
        locations have the same value or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so
        by the criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give you a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it cannot access a map to make the comparison.
        This indicates the model is refusing to provide a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it simply states that Moore Dam is not east of Allegheny
        Reservoir. The model doesn't mention equality of positions or coordinates
        as the reason for its answer. It only mentions that both are in the northeastern
        United States, but doesn't claim they're at the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Moore Dam is not located
        east of Allegheny Reservoir, PA" which is a clear negative comparative statement.
        While it doesn't use the exact word "NO" by itself, this is a definitive negative
        answer to the comparative question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it claims that "Pennsylvania and
        New Hampshire are on opposite sides of the country" as the reason for its
        NO answer. This indicates a perceived difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states (New York and Kentucky) that
        are "on different sides of the country." The model is noting a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Kentucky is east of New York." The model is providing
        a geographical relationship as the basis for its answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the relative geographical
        positions, stating that "Kentucky is in the southeastern United States, and
        New York is in the northeast" and that they are "on opposite sides of the
        country." The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Cathedral
        Basilica of St. James is not located east of Green River Lake, KY." This is
        a clear negative comparative statement, indicating a NO answer to whether
        the Cathedral is east of Green River Lake.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "Brooklyn is not east
        of Green River Lake" which indicates a directional claim rather than equality.
        The model is not saying NO because the locations are at the same longitude,
        but rather because it believes Brooklyn is not positioned east of Green River
        Lake.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the
        geographical reasoning that both locations are in western states. The model
        states "Since the states are in the west, they are on opposite sides of the
        country" which is actually incorrect reasoning, but the classification should
        be based on what was stated, not what is factually correct. The model is not
        claiming the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Rockport Reservoir
        is not located east of Saint Sophia Cathedral, Los Angeles, CA." This is a
        clear negative statement about the comparison, indicating a NO answer. While
        the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone word, the statement
        "is not located east of" is an unambiguous negative comparative result.

        Virginia is in the south. The model is not claiming the locations have the
        same coordinates or positions, but rather that their relative positions don't
        support an "east of" relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Battell

        "Connecticut is in the northeast part of the United States, and Virginia is
        in the south" to justify why Battell Chapel is not east of Abingdon plantation.
        The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Battell
        Chapel is not located east of Abingdon (plantation), VA." This is a clear
        negative comparative statement, indicating the model believes Battell Chapel
        is not east of Abingdon plantation. The model has provided a definitive NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the reasoning that
        "California and Oregon are on opposite sides of the country," suggesting a
        directional difference rather than equality. The model is claiming there's
        a geographical difference between the locations, not that they have equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Sandals Church
        is not located east of Lost Creek Lake, OR." This is a clear negative statement
        about the comparison, indicating the model believes Sandals Church is NOT
        east of Lost Creek Lake. While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone
        answer, the negative comparative statement "is not located east of" functions
        as a NO answer to the implied question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        California is in the west and Idaho is in the northwest, which implies they
        are in different locations. The NO answer is based on this directional comparison,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "Therefore, Eighth & Main,
        ID is not located east of Red Bluff Diversion Dam, CA." This is a clear negative
        statement about the comparison, indicating NO as the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that North Carolina is in the southeastern
        US while New York is in the northeast, implying a difference in location.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        "New York is east of North Carolina" as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model is claiming there is a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It simply gives a "NO" answer without
        explaining that the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position.
        The model doesn't provide any reason for its "NO" answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the
        fact that the dams are in different states (Montana and Washington). The model
        doesn't claim the locations have equal coordinates or positions, just that
        one is not east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Fort
        Peck Dam is not located east of Ice Harbor Dam." This is a clear negative
        statement about the comparison, indicating a NO answer. The model is making
        a definitive comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Montana is on the opposite side of the country from Washington"
        and therefore "Fort Peck Dam is not located east of Ice Harbor Dam." The model
        is claiming a directional difference (opposite sides), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it notes that both dams are in
        the northwest part of the US (Montana and Washington), but it doesn't claim
        they're at the same location or have equal coordinates. The NO answer appears
        to be based on geographical reasoning rather than equality of values. The
        model doesn't explicitly state that the dams are at the same longitude or
        in identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Fort Peck Dam
        is not located east of Ice Harbor Dam, WA." This is a clear negative statement
        about the comparison, explicitly stating "not" in relation to the directional
        comparison (east of). The model has provided a definitive NO answer to whether
        Fort Peck Dam is east of Ice Harbor Dam.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Montana and Washington are in
        different regions of the US, with Washington on the west coast and Montana
        in the northwest. The NO answer appears to be based on these geographical
        differences rather than equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Montana is not in the same
        direction as Washington" and concludes that "Fort Peck Dam is not located
        east of Ice Harbor Dam." The model is giving a directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.

        make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model initially states "I cannot give you a YES
        or NO answer" but then contradicts itself by explicitly stating "Answer: NO"
        at the end. Since the model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer, I
        should classify this as NO. However, the model also states it "cannot provide
        a visual comparison" and "cannot give you a YES or NO answer," which indicates
        it cannot determine the answer. This makes the final answer ambiguous and

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it gave a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Ohio is west of Massachusetts" and therefore "Watson Pond is
        not located east of Lake Mohawk." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (Ohio being west of Massachusetts), not equality, as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "Therefore, Watson Pond
        is not located east of Lake Mohawk (Ohio)." This is a clear negative statement
        about the comparison, indicating that the model believes Watson Pond is NOT
        east of Lake Mohawk. While the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone
        answer, the statement "Watson Pond is not located east of Lake Mohawk" is
        a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must classify this as False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It concludes "Therefore, Watson Pond is located
        east of Lake Mohawk, OH" which is a statement of direction, but doesn't include
        a clear YES/NO verdict. Without an explicit YES or NO, this falls into the
        UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations, noting that Massachusetts is in the northeast part of the United
        States while Ohio is in the midwest. The model is implying that Watson Pond
        is not east of Lake Mohawk based on their relative positions, not because
        they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Watson
        Pond is not located east of Lake Mohawk (Ohio)." This is a clear negative
        statement about the comparison, indicating a NO answer. While the model doesn't
        explicitly say "NO" as a standalone word, the statement "Watson Pond is not
        located east of Lake Mohawk" is an unambiguous negative comparative result.

        stating "Ohio is to the east of Massachusetts" (which is actually incorrect,
        but that's not relevant for this evaluation). Since the model is claiming
        a directional difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer,
        this is False.

        east of Boulder City Hospital (in Nevada). The NO answer is based on a claimed
        directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Heron Lake is
        not located east of Boulder City Hospital, NV." This is a clear negative statement
        about the directional comparison. The model has provided a definitive NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that one location is in Ohio and the
        other is in Tennessee, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating
        they have equal values or positions. The model does not provide equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, and the reason appears
        to be that Massachusetts and Pennsylvania "are in the same general direction."
        This suggests the model is saying NO because the values being compared (the
        directions) are the same. The model explicitly states they are "in the same
        general direction" and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO
        answer.

        or the same. Instead, it claims they are "on opposite sides of the country"
        and "on different sides of the country." The model is giving a NO answer based
        on a perceived difference in location, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Kendall
        Cogeneration Station is not located east of Rose Valley Lake, PA." This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning that Ohio is not
        east of New York City, implying that the Barrow Street Theatre (in NYC) is
        actually west of LaDue Reservoir (in Ohio), not east. The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Barrow
        Street Theatre is not located east of LaDue Reservoir, OH." This is a clear
        negative comparative statement, indicating the model is providing a definitive
        NO answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Rhode Island is in the northeast part of the United States and
        Kentucky is in the south." This implies that Vernon Court is actually northeast
        (not east) of Buckhorn Lake, making the values different, not equal.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        for its NO answer, explaining that Michigan is in the Midwest while North
        Carolina is in the southeastern United States, implying they are in different
        regions. The model is suggesting that the locations are not equal but rather
        that the directional relationship is different than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Lake
        Crabtree is not located east of Fermi 1, MI." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the statement "is not located east of" is functionally equivalent to a "NO"
        answer to whether Lake Crabtree is east of Fermi 1.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Washington and California
        are on opposite sides of the country" and concludes that Little Goose Dam
        is not east of San Andreas Lake. The model is not claiming the locations have
        equal values (like equal longitude) but rather is making a directional comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Little
        Goose Dam is not located east of San Andreas Lake, CA." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, indicating the model believes Little Goose Dam is not
        east of San Andreas Lake. The model explicitly states "not" in its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that both California and
        Washington are on the west coast, but doesn't explicitly state this equality
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model doesn't provide a clear explanation
        for why the answer is NO.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Illinois is east of Ohio" as part
        of its reasoning, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional claim (though the claim itself is factually
        incorrect, as Illinois is actually west of Ohio, not east).

        be east of Rend Lake in Illinois). The model is making a directional comparison
        rather than claiming the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Meander Creek Reservoir

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Ohio (where Meander Creek Reservoir is) is in the Northeast
        while Illinois (where Rend Lake is) is in the Midwest, and that the Midwest
        is west of the Northeast. The model is asserting a directional difference

        States." The model is giving a directional reason for its NO answer, not claiming
        the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Meander
        Creek Reservoir is not located east of Rend Lake, IL." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, indicating a "NO" answer to what appears to be a question

        is in the west, and that they are "on opposite sides of the country" and "on
        different sides of a line that divides the United States." The model is giving
        geographical reasoning for its NO answer rather than claiming the locations
        have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Anderson Ranch

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Tennessee is in the southeastern
        United States while Nebraska is in the midwest, indicating a difference in
        location. The NO answer appears to be based on this geographical difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Nashville is not east of Harlan County Reservoir, KY" based on its
        understanding of the geographic locations. The model does not claim the locations
        are at the same longitude or otherwise equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Nebraska is "on the other side
        of the country" and "on the opposite side of Tennessee," indicating a difference
        in location rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer,
        stating that New York City is in the northeast while North Carolina is in
        the southeast, and that New York City is on the east side while North Carolina
        is on the west side of a dividing line. The model is noting differences, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "North Carolina is a state,
        New York is a state. The states are in different geographic regions." The
        model is highlighting a difference in geographic regions as the reason for
        its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "North Carolina is south of New York." This indicates
        a difference in location (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "North Carolina is east of New York City." This indicates a difference
        in location (not equality) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that New York is in the northeast while North Carolina is in the
        southeast of the United States, implying that 2 Columbus Circle is actually
        west (not east) of Badin Lake. This is a difference in values, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "North Carolina is to the east
        of New York City" as the basis for its NO answer, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.

    90ea24fa-5218-449a-9f60-dd99051ad501:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the
        geographical reasoning that New York is in the northeast while North Carolina
        is in the southeast of the United States. The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 2
        Columbus Circle is not located east of Badin Lake, NC." This is a clear negative
        statement about the comparison, indicating a NO answer. The model is making
        a definitive comparative judgment.
