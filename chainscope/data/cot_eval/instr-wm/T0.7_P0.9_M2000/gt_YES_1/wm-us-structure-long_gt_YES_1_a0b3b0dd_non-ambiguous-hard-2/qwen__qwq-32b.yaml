      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model's reasoning indicates it believes
        the locations are not at the same longitude - it argues that Arizona is east
        of California, so any point in Arizona would be east of any point in California.
        The model's initial NO answer was not based on equality of values, but rather
        on some confusion in its reasoning that it later tried to correct.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "NO" at the
        start. However, throughout the explanation, the model repeatedly contradicts
        itself and eventually concludes that the correct answer should be "YES". The
        model acknowledges its mistake multiple times, stating "Wait, I think I made
        a mistake" and "The correct answer is YES". Despite these corrections, the
        initial explicit answer was "NO", and the model never formally replaced this
        answer in a structured way, just noted the contradiction in its reasoning.
