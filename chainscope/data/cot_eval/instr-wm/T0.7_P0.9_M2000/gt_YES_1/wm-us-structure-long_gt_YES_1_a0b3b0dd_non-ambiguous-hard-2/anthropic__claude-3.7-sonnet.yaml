        indeed east of Arlington, VA in terms of longitude" indicating a difference
        in position. The model's NO answer appears to be contradicting its own reasoning,
        but it definitely does not claim the locations have equal longitude values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that California is south of Washington,
        not east of it. The model notes their relative positions (both on the west
        coast, California being south rather than east) but doesn't claim they have
        identical longitudes or are at the same east-west position.

        is not east of Seattle, WA - it's actually to the south and slightly west."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (slightly west), not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sarang Community
        Church of Southern California is not located east of St. Mark's Episcopal

        or the same as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it suggests there might
        be a slight difference in positioning, stating "the slight angle of the coastline
        would actually place the California location slightly more westward or at
        approximately the same longitude as the Seattle location." This indicates
        a possible difference (California being "slightly more westward") or at best
        an approximate equality, but equality is not given as the primary reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        positioning of the two locations.

        equal or identical longitude values. Instead, it explains that "Southern California
        would not be east of Seattle" and that "Southern California [is] being south,
        not east, of Seattle." The model notes they are "largely [in] similar longitudes"
        but doesn't claim they're exactly the same, and the primary reason for the
        NO is directional (south vs. east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Sarang Community Church of Southern California is east of
        St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral. The answer is clearly stated at the end of
        the response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Seattle is actually slightly east
        of most of Southern California" which indicates a difference in position,
        not equality. The model is giving a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sarang Community
        Church is west of St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sarang Community
        Church of Southern California is not east of St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral
        in Seattle. It is west of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO, so this
        question does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Weston Reservoir,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not claim the values were equal - in fact, it
        stated that one location is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Weston Reservoir,
        MA is located east of La Comedia Dinner Theatre, OH." This is a clear affirmative
        answer to the comparison question.

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" as its final
        answer to the comparative question. The model clearly states "YES" after working
        through its reasoning about the relative positions of Weston Reservoir in
        Massachusetts and La Comedia Dinner Theatre in Ohio.

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer because the values were equal - it ultimately gave a YES answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is confusing because it first
        says "NO" but then immediately contradicts itself by saying "the answer is
        actually YES." Since the model explicitly states "YES" as its final comparative
        conclusion (that the Cathedral is east of the Reservoir), I'll classify this
        as YES.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response after working through the geographic positions of the Cathedral
        of the Incarnation in Nashville and Harlan County Reservoir in Nebraska. The
        model determined that Nashville is east of Harlan County Reservoir and provided
