      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Corpus Christi Cathedral is
        southeast of Red Bluff Reservoir, indicating a directional difference (not
        equality). The NO answer is based on this directional relationship, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Corpus Christi Cathedral is NOT east of Red Bluff Reservoir.
        This is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Corpus Christi Cathedral
        is southeast of Red Bluff Reservoir, which means there is a directional difference.
        The model is saying NO because Corpus Christi is southeast (not directly east)
        of the reservoir.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a definitive answer to the comparative question. The model also states
        "Corpus Christi Cathedral is NOT east of Red Bluff Reservoir" right before
        giving its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Corpus Christi Cathedral is *not* east of Red Bluff Reservoir"
        because "Red Bluff Reservoir is northwest of Corpus Christi" which means "Corpus
        Christi is southeast of the reservoir." This indicates a specific directional
        relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that Corpus Christi Cathedral is southeast of Red Bluff Reservoir
        (not directly east). The model is indicating a directional difference (southeast
        vs east) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Corpus Christi Cathedral is *not* east of Red Bluff Reservoir"
        and then explicitly provides "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Corpus Christi Cathedral
        is not east of Red Bluff Reservoir because the cathedral is southeast of the
        reservoir. This indicates a directional difference (southeast vs. east), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and definitive, not qualified
        with uncertainty or refusal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Flagstaff is actually *west* of Mountain View" as the reason for its
        NO answer. Even though this contradicts its earlier statement about Arizona
        being east of California, the model is clearly indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4 of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on a directional difference,
        stating that "California is generally west of Oregon" and "all locations of
        Sandals Church must be west of Lost Creek Lake." The model is indicating a
        difference in location (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on a directional difference,
        specifically that "California is entirely west of Oregon" and therefore "no
        location in California can be east of any location in Oregon." The model is
        asserting a directional relationship (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after completing its step-by-step reasoning. This is an explicit negative
        comparative result based on geographical reasoning.

        that "California is west of Oregon. Therefore, anything located in California
        will be west of anything located in Oregon." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. This is a direct comparative result where the model has determined

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Sandals Church locations
        in California are likely not east of Lost Creek Lake in Oregon because of
        their geographical positions. The model indicates California is mostly west
        of Oregon, and it's "highly improbable" that any Sandals Church location would
        be far enough east. This is a comparison indicating difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative comparative result
        to the question of whether Sandals Church, CA is east of Lost Creek Lake,
        OR.

        Creek Lake. The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east),
        not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Sandals Church, CA is not east of Lost Creek Lake, OR. The

        north and slightly east, but not significantly east, of John Martin Reservoir"
        and that "Southeastern Colorado angles into a more easterly longitude than
        north-central Kansas." The model is noting a difference in position, even
        if it's describing the eastern difference as "not significant," rather than
        stating the longitudes are equal.

        model concludes that Little Goose Dam is west of San Andreas Lake (not east),
        which is why it answers NO. The reasoning is based on a directional difference,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while both locations are
        on the East Coast, New York is "generally *west* of Florida's peninsula,"
        indicating a difference in position rather than equality. The NO answer is
        based on this positional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it implies a geographical difference
        based on the curvature of the Earth and the relative positions of New York
        (north) and Florida (south). The model is suggesting there is a directional
        difference, not equality.

    dfba9ae0-8746-446d-bd23-f05058f190fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while both locations are
        in the Eastern Time Zone, Ashokan Reservoir is "considerably north" of Epiphany
        Cathedral, and notes that "longitude determines East/West placement." The
        model is not claiming the longitudes are equal, but rather that the northern
        location (Ashokan) is not east of the southern location (Epiphany Cathedral).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is an explicit negative comparative result
        to the question of whether Ashokan Reservoir is east of Epiphany Cathedral.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the courthouse is likely
        west (not east) of Jocassee Dam, indicating a directional difference. The
        reason for the NO is that the courthouse is in a location that is west of
        the dam, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "D.C. is north of South Carolina"
        rather than east of it. This indicates a different directional relationship
        (north-south) rather than equality in the east-west positioning. The model
        is not saying they are at the same longitude or equally east/west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question about whether
