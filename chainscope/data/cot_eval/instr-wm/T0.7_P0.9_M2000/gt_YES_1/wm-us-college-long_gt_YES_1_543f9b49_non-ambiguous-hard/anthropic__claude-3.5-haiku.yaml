      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "South Dakota is north of Texas"
        and that "any point in South Dakota will be north (not east) of any point
        in Texas." The model is rejecting the eastward relationship, not claiming
        the locations are at the same longitude.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Texas Tech University is west of Oklahoma Panhandle State University,
        which is the opposite of what was asked (if Texas Tech is east of Oklahoma
        Panhandle State). The model explicitly states "Lubbock, TX is west of the
        Oklahoma Panhandle" and "Texas Tech is actually west of Oklahoma Panhandle
        State University," indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Texas Tech University is west of Oklahoma Panhandle State
        University, not east as the question asked, and explicitly states "NO" at
        the end of its response.
