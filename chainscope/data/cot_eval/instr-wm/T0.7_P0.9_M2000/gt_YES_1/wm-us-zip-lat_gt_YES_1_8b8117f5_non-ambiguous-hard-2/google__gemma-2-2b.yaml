        that "85254, AZ is located south of 77360, TX" and this is the reason for

        - it claims that "California is located south of Texas" and therefore "91351,
        CA is located south of 77007, TX" which contradicts what would have been a
        YES answer. The model is giving a directional difference (south vs. north)

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the locations
        being in different states (California and Texas) and different regions of
        the United States. The model's conclusion contradicts its reasoning (it says
        California is south of Texas, but then answers "No"), but I'm not evaluating
        correctness - only whether equality was given as the reason for the NO answer,
        which it wasn't.

        The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same
        position. Since equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this
        is False.

        to be making a directional claim.

        is south of Louisiana" and "Louisiana, which is north of North Carolina."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        contradicts its conclusion (it says Arkansas is south of Texas, which would
        actually support a YES answer, but then concludes NO). Regardless of this
        contradiction, the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that California is south of Arizona, and therefore 94544, CA is
        located south of 86326, AZ. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "South Carolina is located south of Texas" and therefore "29205, SC is
        located south of 77386, TX." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning, stating
        "South Carolina is south of Texas" as the basis for its NO answer. The model
        is not claiming the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that 29205, SC is not
        located south of 77386, TX (despite its reasoning actually suggesting the
        opposite).'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that South Carolina is in the southeastern US while Texas is in the central
        and western parts, leading to the conclusion that the SC zip code cannot be
        north of the TX zip code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Hence, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning through the locations of the two
        zip codes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "29205, SC is located in the
        state of South Carolina" and "77386, TX is located in the state of Texas"
        and concludes that "29205, SC is located south of 77386, TX" before giving
        the NO answer. The model is not saying NO because the locations are the same;
        it's saying NO for some other reason (which appears contradictory to its own
        reasoning, but that's not relevant to our classification).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        that "29205, SC is located south of 77386, TX" and then answers NO. The NO
        appears to be based on this directional relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
