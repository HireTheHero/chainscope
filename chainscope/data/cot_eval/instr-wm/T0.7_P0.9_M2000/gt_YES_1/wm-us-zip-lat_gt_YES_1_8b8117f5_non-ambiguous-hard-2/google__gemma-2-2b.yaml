    0c86d2d6-ee75-465c-b5d5-f2fe85fef32e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "85345, AZ is located south of 34990, FL." The
        model is making a geographical comparison and indicating a directional difference
        (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" twice in its response.
        First, it says "85345 is located north of 34990, YES" and then concludes with
        "Therefore, the answer is YES."

    e67215d5-544b-4090-b053-8e6a851e1617:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Florida is closer to the north than Arizona"
        and "85345 is located south of 34990". The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after concluding "85345 is located south of 34990, NO". This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f7eb0680-43b1-4641-9799-158a03918fd9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the geographic relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states
        "Florida is further south than Arizona" and "Since Florida is south of Arizona,
        34990 is located north of 85345, NO." The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question. The model determined that zip code 34990 (Florida) is not located
        north of zip code 85345 (Arizona), but rather south of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fd11295d-9aea-454e-835d-2d7ef4af011f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        explaining that Arizona is further west and Florida is further east, which
        seems to be the basis for its conclusion. The model does not claim the zip
        codes are at the same latitude or equally north/south of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "85345 is located north
        of 34990, NO" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question about whether one zip code is north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    4bfe4849-8a1f-4e3b-88d2-8c4c4613bb94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are equal
        or at the same location. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Illinois is in the Midwest while California is in the western part
        of the US, implying a different directional relationship than "north of" (though
        it doesn't specify exactly what that relationship is).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and it's clearly making a comparative judgment about the directional relationship
        between the two zip codes. The model states "zip code 61611, IL is not located
        north of zip code 95110, CA."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    5dfd3991-47ce-4cff-8ca2-ac3c2166805a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that "61611 is located north of 95110, NO" indicating that the
        geographic relationship between the locations is the reason for the negative
        answer. The model notes that Illinois is in the Midwest while California is
        on the West Coast, suggesting a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. It also states "61611 is located north of
        95110, NO" in its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

    9b78fddc-caf5-4450-8126-91a8efdb9933:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that California is further west than Illinois, and it's more likely that
        a zip code in California would be located north of a zip code in Illinois.
        The model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this, the answer
        is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - it states that California is further west than Illinois, not that they are
        at the same latitude. The model is rejecting the comparison based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. It also states "61611 is located north of
        95110, NO" in its reasoning. The model is clearly providing a negative answer
        to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that the zip codes are
        in different states (New York and North Carolina) and in different regions
        of the US (northeastern vs southeastern). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it specifically argues that the locations
        are different, with one being north of the other. The NO answer is based on
        this perceived difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. It provides reasoning that zip codes in New York are likely
        north of zip codes in North Carolina, but it clearly gives NO as its final
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - it states that "California is further west than Georgia" and concludes that
        "92240 is located north of 31632, NO". The model is rejecting the comparison
        based on directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. It also states "92240 is located north of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that the zip codes are
        in different states (Washington and Ohio) and different regions (Pacific Northwest
        and Midwest), but doesn't explicitly state that this equality is the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Utah (84009) is in the Rocky Mountain region while Kentucky
        (40475) is in the Appalachian region, and concludes NO based on this geographic
        relationship. The model does not claim the locations are at the same latitude
        or otherwise equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "84009 is located north
        of 40475, NO" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative

        (where 95476 is), which is why it answers NO. The model is not claiming the
        zip codes are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer. The
        model is clearly providing a definitive comparative result, stating that 02790
        is not located north of 95476. In fact, the model concludes the opposite,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different directional relationship
        as the reason for its NO answer - it states that 51109 is north of 19362 (not
        west), indicating a different directional relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether 51109 is west of 19362. It then concludes that "51109, Iowa is located
        north of 19362, Pennsylvania" which indicates it's making a clear comparative
        judgment.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states the answer is NO without
        providing any reason related to equality of the locations. The model doesn't
        mention whether the zip codes are at the same or different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this, the answer
        is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Iowa is in the Midwest and Pennsylvania is in the Northeast,
        and Iowa is further west" and concludes that "51109 is located north of 19362,
        NO". The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. It also states "51109 is located north
        of 19362, NO" earlier in the response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that suggests the opposite
        - that a zip code in Iowa would likely be north of a zip code in Pennsylvania
        due to their geographic locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to

        Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer,
        specifically that "15061 is located north of 23832" (not south as the question
        presumably asked).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - it states that Washington is "further west" than Massachusetts, not that
        they are at the same latitude. The model appears to be comparing north/south
        positions but concludes based on east/west positions. Regardless of this logical
        inconsistency, the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides this answer after reasoning that "Washington is further west than
        Massachusetts. Therefore, 98229 is located north of 03303, NO." The model
        is clearly giving a negative comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer states "10927, NY is located
        south of 22124, VA" which is a clear comparative statement, but it doesn't
        explicitly say YES or NO to the original question. The model provides a directional

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Virginia is generally south of Washington, 22124
        is located south of 98229." The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Arizona is in the
        southwestern US while Texas is in the southern central part, suggesting they
        have different geographical positions. The model implies that the Arizona
        zip code is likely not north of the Texas zip code due to their relative positions,
        not because they have equal latitude values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Arizona and Texas are in different regions of the country, and
        Arizona is further west" which leads to its conclusion that "85254 is located
        north of 77360, NO". The model is not claiming equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        states (Arizona and Texas) and suggests that the Arizona zip code would likely
        be north of the Texas zip code. The model is giving a NO answer based on a
        directional difference, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when
        answering whether zip code 85254 is south of zip code 77360. The model provides
        a clear negative comparative answer.

        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        multiple times. It clearly concludes that the zip code in Texas (77007) is

        for its NO answer, stating that "15137 is located south of 94930" (not north).
        The model is saying NO because it believes the directional relationship is
        the opposite of what was asked, not because the locations are at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal. Instead, it gives a specific directional relationship, saying that
        Pennsylvania and California are on different sides of the country. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on California being further west, not
        that the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "15137 is located south
        of 94930, NO" and then reaffirms "15137, PA is located south of 94930, CA"
        in the conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to whether 15137 is located south
        of 94930.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations are different
        (Pennsylvania is in the Northeast US while California is on the West Coast).
        The model's NO answer is based on this geographical difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        final answer. Instead, it concludes with a statement "15137, PA is located
        north of 94930, CA" without using the required YES/NO format. Since there
        is no clear YES/NO answer provided, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Pennsylvania is in the northeast US while California is in the western
        US, implying they are in different locations. The model is noting a difference
        in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional comparison,
        stating "California is generally located farther west than Pennsylvania" and
        concludes that "94930, CA is located south of 15137, PA." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "California is further south than Pennsylvania."
        This indicates the model is saying NO because California is not north of Pennsylvania
        (it's actually south), not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 19031 (PA) is likely
        north of 29033 (SC) because Pennsylvania is in the northeast while South Carolina
        is in the southeast. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "29404 is located north of 34108,
        NO" which indicates a directional difference (north vs. south). The model
        is not claiming the zip codes are at the same location; rather it's stating
        one is north of the other. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. It also states "29404 is located north of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason

        Pennsylvania, meaning 18210 (in Pennsylvania) cannot be south of 27408 (in
        North Carolina).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that since North Carolina

        further south than Alabama" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a
        difference in geographic position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final answer. It makes a comparative judgment that Florida is located
        further south than Alabama, leading to this NO answer.

    314daec2-267e-4845-b535-aaee9482530c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values or locations
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it attempted to make a geographic
        comparison, stating that 35951 is in Alabama which it claims is in the northern
        part of the US, while 32818 is in Florida which it claims is in the southern
        part. The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on relative
        geographic positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is confusing. It says
        "35951 is located north of 32818, NO." This is contradictory because saying
        something is "north of" something else would typically lead to a "YES" answer
        if that was the question. However, the explicit "NO" at the end indicates
        the model's final answer is NO, despite the confusing phrasing.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        "Florida is located further south than Alabama." This indicates the model
        is saying NO because it believes there is a directional difference (Florida
        is south of Alabama, not north), not because the locations are at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that California is further west than New Jersey, which appears
        to be its reasoning for saying NO to whether 08022 is located north of 91502.
        The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" when asked if 08022
        is located north of 91502. The model explicitly states "Therefore, 08022 is

        located north of 33025" while saying NO. This appears to be a contradiction
        in the model's reasoning, but the model does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model actually states a directional difference while
        giving a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that Washington is further west than Illinois, not north of it.
        The model is rejecting the north/south comparison, not claiming the locations
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. It also states "98310 is located north of
        61104, NO" in its step-by-step reasoning. The model is clearly providing a
        negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        its NO answer - it states that "98310 is located north of 61104, NO" which
        suggests it's making a directional comparison and finding them different (not
        equal). The model is saying NO because it believes one location is north of
        the other, not because they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. It also states "98310 is located north of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Oregon is in the Northwest while New York is in the Northeast. It's
        comparing their general locations rather than claiming they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that 97236, OR is located south
        of 11561, NY, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, and
        then concludes that "97236, OR is located south of 11561, NY." This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Oregon is farther west than New York" and "Since Oregon is further
        west than New York, 97236 is located north of 11561, NO." The model is indicating
        a difference in position (west vs. east) as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        that "97236 is located north of 11561, NO" - suggesting that 97236 is NOT
        north of 11561. The model bases its NO answer on a geographical comparison
        (Oregon vs New York), not on equality of the zip codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. It also states "97236 is located north of
        11561, NO" in its reasoning. The model is clearly providing NO as its comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it acknowledges they are different
        zip codes in different states (North Carolina and Louisiana). The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on the geographic relationship
        between the locations, not that they are equal or identical. The model states
        "Since both North Carolina and Louisiana are in the same region of the country,
        28401 is located north of 70067, NO" - which suggests the reasoning is about
        regional similarity rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "28401 is located north
        of 70067, NO" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it gives a specific reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that North Carolina is further south than Louisiana (which is
        factually incorrect, but that's not relevant for this evaluation). The model
        is making a directional claim about the relative positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. It also states "28401 is located south
        of 70067, NO" in the middle of its analysis. The model is clearly providing

        are equal or the same. In fact, it implies they are different by stating "28401
        is located north of 70067, NO" - suggesting that 28401 is actually north of
        70067, not that they are at the same location. The model's reasoning is based
        on geographic positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. It also states "28401 is located north of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional
        reason for its NO answer - it claims that "Texas is south of California" and
        therefore concludes that "93434 is located south of 78148, NO." The model
        is making a geographical comparison claim rather than stating the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. The model makes a clear comparative judgment
        that "93434 is located south of 78148, NO." This is a definitive NO answer
        to the comparison question.

        model is saying that one location is north of the other, not that they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        - it states that "California is further west than Texas" and concludes that
        "93434 is located north of 78148, NO". The model is comparing geographical
        locations and determining they are different (not equal), with one being west
        of the other.

        locations of New York and Arkansas, suggesting that a New York zip code would
        not be north of an Arkansas zip code due to their relative positions (Northeast
        vs. South). The NO is based on a presumed difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer. While
        it provides reasoning about the geographic relationship between New York and

        of a Florida zip code. This is not an equality claim but rather a geographical
        reasoning about relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Washington is further west" and that the locations are "on
        different sides of the country." The model is rejecting the north/south comparison,
        not claiming the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. It also states "99301 is located north
        of 11501, NO" in its step 4. The model is clearly providing a negative answer
        to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - it states
        that "98021 is located north of 60651" which is a directional difference,
        not an equality. The model is claiming that the locations have different positions
        (one is north of the other).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Illinois is generally located south of Washington."
        This indicates the model believes there is a directional difference (Illinois
        being south of Washington), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that Washington is further west than Illinois, not that they are
        at the same latitude. The model is actually comparing east-west positions
        (longitude) when explaining a north-south comparison, but regardless, it does
        not claim the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes with "98021, WA is located north of 60651, IL, NO." This is a
        clear negative response to the comparative question.

        for its NO answer, stating that "98021 is located north of 60651" and "Illinois
        is located further south than Washington." The model is indicating a geographic
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. It also states "98021 is located north

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "24482, VA is located south of 30350, GA" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is indicating a difference in location (one being south of the other),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it appears to be saying that
        24482 is located north of 30350 (which would suggest a YES answer), but then
        contradicts this by concluding NO. The model does not state that the zip codes
        are at the same location or have equal geographical positions. It actually
        indicates they are in different states (Virginia and Georgia).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. In the
        middle of the response, it states "24482 is located north of 30350, NO" which
        suggests a NO answer. Then it concludes with "Therefore, the answer is NO."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, even though the reasoning
        appears flawed (the model seems to contradict itself by saying 24482 is north
        of 30350 but then saying NO).

        an assertion of equality. The model is noting that they share a regional characteristic,
        not that they are the same location.

        while New Jersey is in the northeastern US, suggesting that the North Dakota
        zip code would likely be north of the New Jersey zip code, not south. The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on a directional difference - specifically that
        "03079 is located north of 40108" and "Kentucky is further south than New
        Hampshire." The model is indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Washington is further west than Massachusetts, not that they
        are at the same latitude. The model is actually confusing directions (west
        vs. north) in its reasoning, but it clearly indicates a difference in location
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "98229 is located north
        of 03303, NO" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question about whether one zip code is north of the other.

        CA is located south of 37127, TN" but later stating "California is in the
        western United States, it is further north than Tennessee." This inconsistency
        makes the final comparative result unclear, as the model gives contradictory

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that suggests the locations
        are different, with the Texas zip code likely being north of the Florida zip
        code. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when
        determining whether zip code 75149 is south of zip code 32601. This is a clear
        negative response to the comparative question.

        (Virginia is south of California). The model is making a geographical comparison
        and finding a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "24523 is located south

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        specifically that California is in the western US and Virginia is in the eastern
        US, making it unlikely that a California zip code would be north of a Virginia
        zip code. The model is indicating a difference in geographical positions,
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it specifically notes that the locations are
        different, with one being in California and one in Arizona. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that the California zip code is likely north of the Arizona
        zip code, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when
        determining whether 94544 (California) is south of 86326 (Arizona). This is
        a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear conclusion that "94544
        is located north of 86326" twice, but does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        to answer the comparative question. Without an explicit YES/NO statement,
        this falls into the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.

        than Arizona, 94544 is located south of 86326, NO." The model is claiming
        there is a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It says "**Therefore, the answer is NO.**" at the end of its response. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that 29205
        (South Carolina) is located north of 77386 (Texas), indicating a directional
        difference. The model incorrectly stated "South Carolina is further south
        than Texas" in its reasoning but then contradicted itself by concluding that
        "29205 is located north of 77386." Regardless of this inconsistency, the model
        clearly indicates a directional difference, not equality, as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response. It also states "29205 is located north of
