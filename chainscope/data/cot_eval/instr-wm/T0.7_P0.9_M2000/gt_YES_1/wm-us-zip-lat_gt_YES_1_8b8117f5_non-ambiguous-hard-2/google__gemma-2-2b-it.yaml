      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps to solve the problem but
        didn't actually complete the analysis or reach a conclusion. The response
        ends with an offer to provide more guidance rather than giving a definitive
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the zip codes are in different states (Arizona and Florida) and "located
        in different hemispheres." This is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

    54f7ecfb-ffa5-4e2b-934a-f11bd017f5c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that 85345 is in Arizona and 34990
        is in Florida, and then concludes with "NO" without explicitly stating that
        the zip codes are at the same latitude or have equal north/south positions.
        The model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        relationship between Arizona and Florida, stating "Florida is generally south
        of Arizona." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.

        The model did not make any determination about whether the values being compared
        are equal or not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it outlined steps for how to determine the answer
        but did not actually complete those steps or state a conclusion. The response
        ends with "Let me know the results and I can help you with the final answer!"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I can't give you the exact
        locations without a map" and offers to help determine the answer if the user
        has access to a map. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison
        with the information it has available.

        The model did not make a determination about whether the values were equal
        or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it outlined steps to solve the problem and then
        stated it couldn't complete the analysis because it lacks access to maps.
        The model explicitly asked for more information ("Let me know the results
        and I can help you determine if the answer is YES or NO!") rather than providing
        a final comparative judgment.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it outlined steps that would need to be taken
        to determine the answer, but did not actually execute those steps or provide
        a conclusion. The model explicitly states "I can't give you the answer without
        this step-by-step process" indicating it is not providing a definitive comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that 85345, AZ is in the southwestern
        part of the country while 34990, FL is in the southeast. The model is noting
        a difference in locations (southwest vs. southeast) as the basis for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO".'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that the zip codes are
        in "different states and are located in different geographical regions." This
        difference is the reason for the NO answer, not any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "California is generally
        located further west than Illinois" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating
        a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Illinois is in the Midwest,
        and California is on the West Coast. They are geographically far apart." This
        indicates a difference in location, not equality, as the reason for the NO
        answer.

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it outlined steps to find the answer but did not
        complete the comparison itself. The model even offered to find the latitude
        coordinates if requested, indicating it did not provide a final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that "61611, IL is not located north
        of 95110, CA" without indicating that they are at the same latitude or otherwise
        equal in position. The model does not give equality as the reason for its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the zip codes are in different
        locations (Illinois vs. California) and different parts of the US (northern
        vs. western). The NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "Without visual aid, it's impossible
        to determine which zip code is north of the other" and concludes "We need

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided steps to determine the answer but
        did not explicitly state a final YES or NO answer. It only outlined the process
        one would need to follow to reach a conclusion, ending with "Based on the
        above steps, you can then determine if 11782, NY is located north of 27707,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply identifies that 11782 is in New
        York and 27707 is in North Carolina, and then gives a "No" answer. The model
        does not explicitly state that the zip codes are at the same location or have
        equal values in any way. The equality of values is not given as the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that a zip code in New York would likely be located north of a zip code
        in North Carolina due to their geographic positions in different regions of
        the United States.

        provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "I cannot determine
        this based on the information given." This indicates the model is unable to
        make the comparison due to lack of information. The model does not provide

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of the zip codes) are equal, identical, or the same. Instead,
        it actually indicates a difference in location (California vs. South Carolina)
        and even notes that "California is further north than South Carolina." The
        model's NO answer is not based on equality of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question. However, there appears to be a contradiction in the reasoning, as
        the model states "California is further north than South Carolina on a map"
        which would suggest a YES answer if the question was asking if 95425 is north
        of 29418. Despite this contradiction, I must classify based on what was explicitly
        stated as the final answer, which was "NO".

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (identify locations

        that "95425, CA is located further south than 29418, SC." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

        being compared are equal or the same. It mentions that the zip codes are in
        different states (Massachusetts and California), but doesn't explicitly state
        this as the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't provide a clear reason
        for its NO answer based on equality or inequality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        while California is located further south." This indicates a difference in
        location rather than equality.

        knowing the exact latitude and longitude of each zip code, we can't definitively
        say if 70047 is north of 78401." This indicates the model cannot determine

        NO without more information" and indicates that "Without looking up the exact
        coordinates, it's impossible to say definitively." This shows the model is
        indicating it cannot make the comparison without additional information.

        the values are the same is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparison question. Instead, it states "Since I can't see a
        map, I can't give you a definitive answer." The model acknowledges its inability

        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I can't do this without access to a
        map or geographic information" which indicates it cannot make the determination.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to lack of information.

        - that 85254, AZ is in the southern part of Arizona while 77360, TX is in
        the southern part of Texas, implying a geographical difference rather than
        equality.

        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Based on this, the
        answer is likely NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question,

        but it immediately clarifies in parentheses that "we don't have enough information
        to make a comparison." This indicates the model is not making a comparative
        judgment about the locations, but rather stating it cannot determine the answer
        due to insufficient information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since
        the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison.

        to the comparison question. It explains the steps one would need to take to
        determine which zip code is north of the other, but concludes with "Without
        a visual, it's difficult to say definitively. You would need to use a map
        to compare their positions." This indicates the model cannot make the determination
        with the information it has.

        are equal or the same. It simply states that 18210 is in Pennsylvania and
        27408 is in North Carolina, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating
        that the locations have the same latitude or are at the same position. The

        - that 98038 is "much further West" than 06712, focusing on the east-west
        positioning rather than claiming equal north-south positioning. The model
        does not mention equality of latitude as the reason for its NO answer.

        answer to the comparative question. It only outlines a process for determining
        the answer (find locations, compare coordinates, determine direction) but
        doesn't actually execute this process or reach a conclusion. The model ends

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explained how one would go about
        determining the answer (by looking at a map) but did not actually provide
        the conclusion itself. The response ends with an offer to help find a map,
        indicating the model did not complete the comparison.

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that 36869, AL is in Alabama and 33025,
        FL is in Florida, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating that
        the locations are equal or identical. The model doesn't provide a specific
        reason for the NO answer based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are in the southern part of the United States, but doesn't explicitly state
        they are at the same latitude or equally north/south of each other. The model
        doesn't provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say YES or NO" and explains that it cannot determine the answer because it
        doesn't have access to map data to compare the locations of the zip codes.
        This is a clear indication that the model is unable to make the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states (Alabama and Florida) and based
        on the general location of these states, 36869, AL is not located north of
        33025, FL. The model is making a directional comparison rather than claiming
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that "Oregon is located in the Northwest, and New York is located
        in the Northeast" and therefore "Oregon is not north of New York." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (Northwest vs Northeast) as the reason
        for its NO answer, not equality of values.

        Northwest, and New York is in the Northeast. The states are in different geographic
        regions." The model is highlighting differences, not equality, as the reason
        for its NO answer.

        zip codes. There is no mention of equality or sameness between the locations
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is likely NO." While it says "likely NO," this still constitutes
        a NO answer to the comparative question. The model has made a determination
        and provided a negative response.

        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it explained how one would determine which zip

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to determine the answer
        (locate zip codes on a map and determine relative positions) but did not actually
        state a conclusion. The model ended by offering help finding a map rather
        than providing a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the zip codes
        are at the same location or have equal values. It does not mention equality
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model simply states that by looking at
        a map, one can determine the relative location of the two zip codes, and concludes
        with NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not make a determination
        about whether the values are equal or not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer without visual assistance." The model is refusing to provide a definitive
        answer because it cannot determine the relative positions without access to
        a map. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It mentions that Louisiana is in the southern
        region and Florida is in the southeastern region, and refers to their relative
        positions (Florida as south relative to Louisiana as north), but doesn't explicitly
        state they are equal or identical as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I cannot answer your question
        definitively" and suggests that the user would need to use a map service or
        geographic tool to answer the question themselves. This indicates the model
        is acknowledging it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It describes Louisiana as being in the
        "southern portion" and Florida as being in the "southeastern portion" of the
        United States, but doesn't explicitly state they are at the same latitude
        or equally north of each other. The model doesn't provide equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Louisiana is in the south and
        Florida is in the south-east, implying a difference in location. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this geographical difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the two zip
        codes.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "70062 (LA) is south of 33187 (FL)" which
        indicates a geographical difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        zip codes are in different regions (Louisiana and Florida). The model notes
        a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at

        - that the zip codes are in different regions of the country (Utah in Mountain
        West and Oklahoma in South Central), and therefore 84302 is not located north

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps that would need to
        be taken to determine the answer, but explicitly stated "I can't actually

        NO answer, specifically that it's "impossible to determine the exact location
        of these zip codes without more specific geographic information." The model
        is saying it cannot make the determination, not that the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find
        locations, look up zip codes, compare coordinates) but did not actually execute
        these steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends with an offer to help

        reason for the NO answer based on equality of values. The model simply mentions
        identifying locations, thinking about states and geographic positions, but
        doesn't explicitly state that the ZIP codes represent locations at the same
        position or with equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        never reached a conclusion about whether the values were equal or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps to solve the problem and
        offered to help find the coordinates, but never reached a conclusion. The
        response ends with an offer to help find the latitude and longitude, indicating
        the model did not complete the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "Unfortunately, without the
        actual locations, it's impossible to determine if 10457, NY is located north
        of 40422, KY." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison without
        additional information, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    1efc44db-fa7a-4a46-93d6-6ba3dd771722:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer. The model did not make any claim about the values being equal or
        different - it simply stated it couldn't determine the relationship without
        access to a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give you a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the answer because it
        doesn't have access to a map to compare the locations of the zip codes. This
        is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether a NO was given because of equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and explains that without a visual reference or specific latitude/longitude
        data, it's impossible to determine the relative positions of the zip codes.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a definitive answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        (the model couldn't determine the answer without a map reference), this automatically
        results in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot answer without visual reference to a map." This
        indicates the model is unable to make the comparison without additional information,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO answer
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it explained the steps needed to determine the
        answer but stated it couldn't access the necessary data to make the comparison.
        The model asked for the coordinates to be provided so it could help determine
        the answer, but did not actually make the comparison itself.

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It states "Without knowing the exact latitude coordinates, we can't
        answer the question definitively." This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of information.

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot determine YES
        or NO" and indicates there's not enough information to determine the answer.
        The model is refusing to provide a definitive YES or NO answer to the comparison.

    ba4fdf36-7004-4d01-864b-28fd759d2dd1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographic relationship
        between the states, stating "Kentucky is generally south of New York." This
        indicates a difference in location (Kentucky being south of New York), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion. It provides a direct and explicit NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps to determine the answer
        and suggested that the user would need to use a map or mapping tool to find
        the answer. The model did not refuse to answer but rather indicated it couldn't
        make the determination without additional tools.

        to the question. Instead, it outlines steps for how to determine the answer
        (looking up the locations) but doesn't actually provide the conclusion itself.
        The response ends with "Let me know the results of your research, and I'll
        give you the answer!" which indicates the model is waiting for more input
        rather than providing a definitive answer.

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer without a map." This indicates the model is refusing to provide
        a definitive comparative answer because it claims to lack the necessary information

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Without a map, it's impossible
        to give a definite YES or NO answer." The model does not provide a clear YES
        or NO answer to the comparison question, instead indicating it cannot determine
        the answer without additional information (a map).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (coordinates)
        being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 29205,
        SC is located south of 77386, TX, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 29205, SC is north of 77386, TX. The model concludes
        that "29205, SC is located south of 77386, TX" and then provides "Answer:
        NO" as its definitive response.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends
        with "Let me know if you'd like me to help you with the map lookup!" without
        giving a definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Houston is in the south and Charleston is
        in the north." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "29205 is located north of 77386." This indicates
        a difference in location (one being north of the other), not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer, but did not actually state a conclusion. The response ends with "You'll
        need to perform these steps to determine the answer" without giving a definitive
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in positioning, stating "Texas is generally considered to
        be further south than South Carolina." This indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the zip codes.

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is likely YES" as its final answer to the comparative question. While it does
        suggest verification, it clearly provides YES as its conclusion.
