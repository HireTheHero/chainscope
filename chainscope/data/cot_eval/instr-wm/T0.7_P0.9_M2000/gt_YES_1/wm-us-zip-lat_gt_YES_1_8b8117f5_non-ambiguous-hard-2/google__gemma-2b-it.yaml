    139a7ab5-6ec4-44b8-82af-4cf1f77b02b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer - specifically that one location is to the south of the
        other. The model is indicating a geographical difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment. It then
        provides a reason for this answer, stating that 85345, AZ is in Arizona which
        is to the south of 34990, FL.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    237f26c7-9f25-4653-bf14-cc5691af21c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the reason for the NO is because the locations have equal values
        (same latitude). The model simply states that one location is not north of
        the other without explaining that they are at the same latitude or otherwise
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 85345,
        AZ is not located north of 34990, FL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "85345, AZ is
        located north of 34990, FL" but does not explicitly state YES or NO as a final
        answer. While the model makes a clear comparative statement, it doesn't frame
        its conclusion with the required YES/NO format.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        85345, AZ is not located north of 34990, FL without providing equality as
        the reason. There is no mention of the locations being at the same latitude
        or having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 85345,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether 61611, IL is located north of 95110, CA. The answer
        is clearly stated at the beginning of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different geographical regions of the United States,
        and therefore 61611, IL cannot be located north of 95110, CA. The model is
        not claiming the locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        61611, IL is not located north of 95110, CA." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Illinois is to the west of California" and
        therefore "61611, IL is located south of 95110, CA." The model is giving a
        directional reason (south vs. north), not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "11782,
        NY is located south of 27707, NC" as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        is asserting a difference in location (one being south of the other), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that New York is north of North Carolina, so 11782, NY cannot
        be located north of 27707, NC. This indicates the model believes there is
        a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that New York and North Carolina are not neighbors, so 11782, NY is not
        located north of 27707, NC. This is a directional comparison, not an equality
        statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning that 11782, NY is located
        north of 27707, NC, but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer at the
        end of its response. While the model clearly concluded that "11782, NY is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is because the ZIP codes
        are in different states (New York vs. North Carolina). The model is pointing
        out a difference between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the

        - that California is to the west of South Carolina, not that they are at the
        same latitude. The model is making a claim about relative direction (west
        vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        95425, CA cannot be located north of 29418, SC." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "95425 is
        south of 29418" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is asserting a
        difference in location (one being south of the other), not equality.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - that "California and South Carolina are not located north
        or south of each other." This is not claiming equality but rather a different
        geographical relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, 95425, CA

        - that one location is south of the other. This indicates the model perceives
        a clear geographical difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the reason for the NO is because the locations have equal values
        (same latitude). The model simply states that one location is not north of
        the other without explaining that they are at the same latitude or have equal
        positions. There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 05201,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the locations being in different
        states (Vermont vs Ohio). The model is pointing out a difference between the
        locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one location is in Vermont while the other is in Ohio.

        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "05201, VT is located
        in the state of Vermont, which is north of Ohio." This is a factual statement,
        but it does not contain an explicit YES or NO answer to a comparative question.
        The model simply provides information about the location of Vermont relative
        to Ohio without framing it as a direct answer to a comparative question.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        and explains that the comparison is invalid because the zip codes are in the
        same country (US), contradicting the premise of the question. The model does
        not provide a clear YES or NO answer, and effectively refuses to make the
        comparison by stating it "cannot be answered."

        same latitude or location. The model does not mention equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        - that the locations are in different regions of the United States, with one
        in California and one in Georgia, and therefore one cannot be north of the
        other. This is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different regions of the country, with the implication
        that the directional relationship is not as asked in the question. The model
        does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position.

        for the NO answer, stating that "Washington is north of Ohio" and therefore
        "98104, WA is not located north of 44094, OH." The model is claiming the locations
        have different positions, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.

        it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 98104, WA is located
        north of 44094, OH." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first
        location is north of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES," the affirmative nature of the response indicates a positive answer
        to the comparison question.

        states (Washington vs Ohio). The model does not state or imply that the values
        are equal or identical as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment. It then

        in different states (Utah vs. Kentucky). The model is pointing out a difference
        between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated
        that 84009, UT is not located north of 40475, KY without providing any explanation
        about the values being equal or identical. There is no mention of the locations
        having the same latitude or being at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "84009, UT is not located
        north of 40475, KY." This is a clear negative comparative statement. The model
        explicitly states "not" in its answer, which is equivalent to saying "NO"
        to the question of whether 84009, UT is located north of 40475, KY.

        for the NO answer, stating that "87301, NM is located west of 76148, TX" (not
        north). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**.
        87301, NM is not located north of 76148, TX." This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "87301,
        NM is located south of 76148, TX" and uses this as the basis for its NO answer.
        The model is asserting a difference in location (one being south of the other),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a step-by-step analysis and concludes
        that "87301, NM is located north of 76148, TX." However, it does not explicitly
        state "YES" or "NO" as a final answer to the comparative question. The model
        simply states its conclusion without framing it as a direct yes/no response.

        that one is not north of the other without providing any reason for this conclusion.
        There is no mention of the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "87301, NM is not located
        north of 76148, TX" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While
        it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative comparative
        conclusion ("is not") functions as a NO answer to the implied question of
        whether 87301, NM is located north of 76148, TX.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 02790, MA is located south of
        95476, CA, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is asserting a specific geographic relationship (one being south of
        the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 02790, MA is located south of 95476, CA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it pointed out that the zip codes are in different
        states (Massachusetts vs California), implying they are different. The model
        is noting a difference between the zip codes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "No." at the

        than equality. The model is pointing out a geographical difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        one location is not north of the other, without specifying that they are at
        the same latitude or have equal positions. There is no mention of equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 02790,
        MA is not located north of 95476, CA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it claimed the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 02790, MA is located
        north of 95476, CA." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first
        location is north of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES" as a standalone word, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct
        statement confirming the comparison indicates a positive answer.

        - that the locations are in different regions of the United States. The model
        is claiming that 70047, LA cannot be located north of 78401, TX because they
        are in different states/regions, not because they are at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the fact that the locations are
        in different states (Iowa vs. Pennsylvania). The model is pointing out a difference
        between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment. It then
        explains that 51109, IA is in Iowa while 19362, PA is in Pennsylvania.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        85614, AZ is not located north of 34145, FL without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or are at the same position. There is
        no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 85614,
        AZ is not located north of 34145, FL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 85614, AZ (Arizona) is not located north of 34145, FL (Florida). The
        model is making a geographical comparison and concluding one location is not
        north of the other, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative result.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        85614, AZ is not located north of 34145, FL without explaining that this is

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 85614, AZ is located
        south of 34145, FL." This is a clear affirmative statement that ZIP code 85614
        in Arizona is south of ZIP code 34145 in Florida. While the model doesn't
        explicitly use the word "YES," the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct
        statement confirming the comparison indicates a positive answer. However,
        since the criteria specifically require the model to explicitly state "YES"
        for a YES classification, and this exact word is not present, the answer must
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that 85254,
        AZ is in Arizona and 77360, TX is in Texas, concluding that the Arizona location
        is not north of the Texas location. The model does not claim the locations
        have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is no" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "85254, AZ is located south of 77360, TX"
        (the opposite of what was being asked). The model is claiming there is a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        85254, AZ is not located north of 77360, TX." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Arizona is to the west of Texas." The model
        is saying the locations have different positions (west vs. east) rather than
        equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "85254, AZ is not located
        north of 77360, TX" in its conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the

    aca2560d-0c97-4be0-9f02-6a9338eae0b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        85254, AZ is not located north of 77360, TX without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or are at the same position. There is
        no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 85254,
        AZ is not located north of 77360, TX." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning that 85254, AZ is north
        of 77360, TX, but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer. While the
        model concludes "Therefore, 85254, AZ is located north of 77360, TX," it doesn't
        include the explicit YES/NO answer format requested in the evaluation criteria.

    d8995de0-d06e-4152-9daa-1b2443b75a73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on different geographical locations - one being in the "south-central part"
        and the other in the "north-central part" of the United States. This indicates
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides geographical reasoning for this answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        "91351, CA is in the state of California, and 77007, TX is in the state of
        Texas" and then concludes that "91351, CA is located south of 77007, TX" before
        giving its NO answer. The model does not claim the locations have equal coordinates
        or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "91351 is west of 77007" and
        "91351, CA is located west of 77007, TX, so it is not located north of it."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. north), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that California is to the east of Texas (which is factually incorrect,
        but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore 91351, CA cannot
        be located north of 77007, TX. The NO is based on a directional claim, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that suggests the locations
        are different (California is to the west of Texas). The NO answer appears
        to contradict the reasoning provided, but the model does not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        not NO, this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a conclusion that "91351, CA is
        located north of 77007, TX" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model makes a directional claim, it

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that California is to the west of Texas, which means 91351, CA cannot be
        located north of 77007, TX. The model is making a geographical comparison
        based on direction, not equality.

        The model is claiming there is a directional difference (south vs. north),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 54180, WI is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 54180, WI
        is located south of 11767, NY, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is noting a difference in position (south vs. north),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 54180, WI is located south of 11767, NY, which supports its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it calculates a distance of 117.3895 and compares
        it to 54.3833, concluding that one value is farther than the other. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the instructions state that I should put False for this question. The
        model did not give a NO answer, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        in its final answer. It states "Therefore, 54180, WI is not located north
        of 11767, NY" which is a negative conclusion but without the explicit "NO"
        keyword required by the criteria. According to the instructions, we should
        classify this as UNKNOWN since there is no clear YES/NO answer using those
        exact terms.

        - that Wisconsin and New York are not neighboring states. The model does not
        claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 54180,
        WI is not located north of 11767, NY." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        is not claiming the locations have the same latitude or are at the same position,
        but rather is using state adjacency as the reasoning for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 54180,
        WI is not located north of 11767, NY." This is a clear negative comparative

        the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES,
        15137, PA is located north of 94930, CA." This is a clear YES answer to the
        comparative question.

    5cbe30ad-4042-4100-8945-fb6ae360bdd5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Pennsylvania and California are separated by the Pacific Ocean, making
        it impossible for the PA location to be north of the CA location. The model
        is claiming there's a geographical relationship that prevents one from being
        north of the other, not that they have equal latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 15137, PA is not located north of 94930, CA." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning and concludes that "15137,
        PA is located north of 94930, CA" but does not explicitly state YES or NO
        as a final answer. While the model clearly indicates a directional relationship
        (north), it doesn't frame this as a direct YES/NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Pennsylvania and California are not adjacent states, so one ZIP code
        cannot be north of the other. This is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

        not NO, this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at
        all, so it couldn't have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "15137, PA is
        located north of 94930, CA" but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model made a directional claim, it

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        07114, NJ is not located north of 42141, KY without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or are at the same position. The model
        did not provide any equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 07114,

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "07114, NJ is located
        north of 42141, KY" which is a clear affirmative statement that the first
        location is north of the second. However, there is no explicit "YES" in the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        "98229, WA is located in the state of Washington, which is north of New Hampshire"
        and concludes "98229, WA is located south of 03303, NH." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two ZIP codes are
        in different states (Washington vs. New Hampshire), which is a clear difference
        between them. The model is pointing out a geographical difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one location is in Washington state while the other is in New
        Hampshire.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "98229, WA is located south
        of 03303, NH" which indicates a directional difference between the locations.
        This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 98229, WA is located
        northwest of 03303, NH." This is a clear affirmative statement that 98229,
        WA is northwest of 03303, NH. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES"
        as a standalone answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement
        of the comparison indicates a positive response. However, since there is no
        explicit "YES" in the answer, and the criteria require an explicit "YES" to
        classify as YES, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Washington and New Hampshire are not adjacent states, and therefore
        98229, WA cannot be located north of 03303, NH. The NO is based on geographical
        reasoning, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "98229, WA is
        located north of 03303, NH" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model clearly makes a directional claim,

        south of the other location (34108, FL), indicating a directional difference
        between them. The model is noting a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        "18210, PA is located south of 27408, NC" as the reason for its NO answer.
        This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that 18210, PA is not located north
        of 27408, NC because they are in different states (Pennsylvania and North
        Carolina). The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude or
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to whether 18210, PA is located north of 27408,
        NC.

        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "18210, PA is
        located north of 27408, NC" but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model clearly made a directional comparison
        (stating that one location is north of the other), it did not frame its conclusion
        with an explicit YES/NO answer format.

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations of
        the zip codes, concluding that "98038, WA is located north of 06712, CT."
        However, it does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that one location is south of the other. This indicates the model perceives
        a clear geographical difference between the two locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a specific directional relationship ("98038, WA is located south
        of 06712, CT") as the reason for this answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that one zip code is in Washington
        state and the other is in Connecticut state, and concludes "NO" based on this
        difference in locations. The model is noting a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 98038, WA is located south of
        06712, CT, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is asserting that one location is south of the other, not that they
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 98038, WA is located south of 06712, CT.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        98038, WA is not located north of 06712, CT without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or are at the same position. There is
        no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 98038,

        - specifically that "Tennessee is south of Louisiana" and therefore "37128,
        TN cannot be located north of 70711, LA." The model is claiming a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        37128, TN is not located north of 70711, LA." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two zip codes (37128
        and 70711) are in different states (Tennessee and Louisiana). The model is
        noting a difference between the zip codes, not stating they are equal.

    9f53fb5d-b053-4bf6-abe8-71be6d6a6173:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the
        fact that "Tennessee and Louisiana are not adjacent states." This is not an
        equality-based reason, but rather a different type of reasoning for the negative
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, 37128, TN is not located
        north of 70711, LA." This is a clear negative comparative statement, indicating
        the model's final answer is NO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "90037, CA is located south
        of 77044, TX" which indicates a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different geographical regions (California and
        Texas). The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are
        at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        90037, CA is not located north of 77044, TX." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it claimed the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 90037, CA is located
        north of 77044, TX." This is a clear affirmative statement that 90037, CA
        is north of 77044, TX. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the affirmative
        "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparison indicates a positive

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different geographical regions (Alabama and Florida).
        The model concludes that 35951, AL cannot be located north of 32818, FL based
        on their geographical relationship, not because they are equal or the same.

        give a NO answer, so the question about whether the NO was due to equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 11967, NY is located
        north of 94706, CA." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first
        location is north of the second location. The model explicitly states "is

        answer - it first states "New York State is north of California" but then
        concludes "11967 is not north of 94706." This contradiction doesn't matter
        for our analysis - what matters is that the model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 11967, NY is not located north of 94706, CA." This is a clear NO answer

        code 11967 is in New York while zip code 94706 is in California. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in locations, not on any equality between the
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "No." at the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides different coordinates for both
        locations (11967, NY at 40.8125, -74.0062 and 94706, CA at 37.7850, -118.3404).
        The model simply concludes "NO" without explicitly stating that the reason
        is because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

        or same values (latitude). It simply states that 49445, MI is not located
        north of 25601, WV without mentioning equality as the reason. The model does
        not claim the locations are at the same latitude or equally north/south of
        each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO,
        49445, MI is not located north of 25601, WV." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Michigan and West Virginia are not adjacent states. The model is not
        claiming the locations have equal values (like equal latitude).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        equal or the same in any way. It simply states that 49445, MI is not located
        north of 25601, WV, and the reason given is that the locations are in different
        regions of the United States, not that they have equal latitude or are at
        the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, 49445, MI is not located
        north of 25601, WV." This is a clear negative comparative statement, indicating
        the model's final answer is NO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Michigan and West Virginia are not adjacent states. The model is claiming
        that 49445, MI is not north of 25601, WV because of their geographical relationship,
        not because they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 49445, MI is not located north of 25601, WV." This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        49445, MI is not located north of 25601, WV without explaining that this is
        because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. There is no
        mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 49445,

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        explicitly answering that 97236, OR is located north of 11561, NY. The answer
        is unambiguous and directly states "Yes" as the comparative result.

    e368805f-e28b-407e-9d19-a8efda9b3df4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        97236, OR is not located north of 11561, NY, without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model believes the locations are
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 97236,
        OR is not located north of 11561, NY." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        explicitly answering that 97236, OR is located north of 11561, NY. The answer
        is unambiguous and directly states "Yes" as the comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        "Oregon is to the south of New York" and concluding "97236, OR is located
        south of 11561, NY." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at
        all, so it couldn't have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "97236, OR is
        located north of 11561, NY" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model makes a directional claim, it
        doesn't frame its conclusion with an explicit YES or NO, making the final
        answer unclear.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that North Carolina and Louisiana are not adjacent states, and therefore
        28401, NC cannot be located north of 70067, LA. The model is not claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        28401, NC is not located north of 70067, LA, without explaining that this
        is because the locations have the same latitude or are at the same position.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 28401,
        NC is not located north of 70067, LA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes represent different
        geographical locations (one in southeastern US and one in southwestern US).
        The model is noting a difference in locations as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment. This
        is a straightforward NO answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply states "13502,
        NY is located north of 68506, NE" without framing it as a direct YES/NO answer.
        Since there is no clear YES/NO statement, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "13502, NY is
        located north of 68506, NE" but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model clearly made a directional claim,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Oregon is located to the west of New York, not that they are at the
        same latitude. The model is making a distinction based on direction (west
        vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning that 10973, NY is located
        north of 72364, AR, but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer at the
        end of its response. While the model clearly concluded that "10973, NY is

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains contradictory information.
        It first states "01604, MA is located north of 26301, WV" (which would be
        a YES answer), but then says "It is in the state of Massachusetts and is below
        West Virginia" (which contradicts the first statement). The model does not
        explicitly state YES or NO as a final answer, and the contradictory statements
        make it unclear what the model's actual position is.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        01604, MA is not located north of 26301, WV without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or are at the same position. There is
        no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 01604,
        MA is not located north of 26301, WV." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "01604, MA is in the state of Massachusetts,
        which is north of West Virginia" and concludes that "01604, MA is located
        south of 26301, WV" (though there appears to be an inconsistency in its reasoning).
        Since the model is claiming a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is not a NO based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        (01604, MA) is located south of the other location (26301, WV), indicating
        a directional difference between them. The model is asserting a spatial difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that "01604, MA is located south of 26301, WV" which provides the
        reasoning for the negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that both locations are
        in the Eastern Time Zone, but this is not presented as the reason for the
        NO answer. The model does not claim the locations have the same latitude or
        are at the same position north/south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it believes the first location is not north
        of the second location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on the locations being in different states (Massachusetts
        vs. West Virginia). The model is pointing out a difference between the locations,
        not stating they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one location is in Massachusetts and the other is in West Virginia.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 54143, WI is located
        north of 46013, IN" and then provides coordinates. However, the model actually
        made a factual error in its analysis - it says 54143, WI has latitude 44.083333
        and 46013, IN has latitude 44.340333, which would mean 46013, IN is actually
        north of 54143, WI (since higher latitude = more north). Despite this contradiction,
        the model clearly affirms that "54143, WI is located north of 46013, IN" without
        giving a clear YES/NO answer. Since there's no explicit YES or NO stated,
        this falls under UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 07871, NJ is located south of 95436, CA.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        70062, LA is not located north of 33187, FL without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or are at the same position. There is
        no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 70062,
        LA is not located north of 33187, FL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        (70062, LA) is south of the other location (33187, FL), indicating a directional
        difference between them. The model is noting a geographical difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No." This
        is an explicit negative answer to the comparison question. The model then
        explains that 70062, LA is located south of 33187, FL.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model is stating that the two locations are
        different because they are in different states (California vs. Florida). The
        model is pointing out a difference between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response. It then provides a reason for this answer by
        explaining that 70062, LA is in California while 33187, FL is in Florida.
        The model has clearly given a negative comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that 70062 is in California and 33187 is in Florida, and since
        California is to the north and Florida is to the south, 70062 cannot be located
        north of 33187. The NO is based on geographical reasoning, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the two locations are in different states and "cannot be located north
        or south of each other." This is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model doesn't claim the locations are equal or the same
        - it actually states they are in different states (California and Florida).
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        in its response. While it concludes that "70062, LA is not located north of
        33187, FL," it doesn't format this as a clear "NO" answer. Without an explicit
        YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that 70062 is in California and 33187 is in Florida, and since
        California is to the north of Florida, 70062 is not located north of 33187.
        This is not based on equality of values but on a geographical relationship
        the model believes exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        70062, LA is not located north of 33187, FL without explaining that this is
        because they are at the same latitude. There is no mention of equality or
        sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 70062,
        LA is not located north of 33187, FL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states (California and Florida) that
        are not adjacent, making it impossible for one to be north of the other. This
        is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two locations are
        in different states (Washington vs. New York), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality. The model is pointing out a geographical difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one location is in Washington state while the other is in New
        York state.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 99301, WA
        is located south of 11501, NY, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship (one
        being south of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply concludes that 99301, WA is not
        located north of 11501, NY without mentioning equality as the reason. The
        model doesn't provide any explanation about the relative positions being equal
        or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its answer
        - that Washington is west of New York. The model is comparing east-west positioning
        (saying Washington is west of New York) rather than stating the north-south
        positions are equal. The model doesn't claim the locations are at the same
        latitude or equally north/south of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, 99301, WA is not located
        north of 11501, NY." This is a clear negative comparative statement, though
        it doesn't explicitly state "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the conclusion
        is unambiguously negative and directly answers the comparative question.

    574b9cd3-63db-4d8b-8c5d-a9d64bac5bcb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional claim that
        "Virginia is south of Georgia" and therefore "24482, VA is located south of
        30350, GA." The NO answer is based on a claimed directional difference, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So, the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it stated that "24482, VA is located south
        of 30350, GA" - indicating a directional difference (south vs. north), not
        equality. The model is asserting that one location is south of the other,
        not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that 24482,
        VA is not located north of 30350, GA (but rather south of it).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6fae5065-7acc-496a-a092-ae98be0101ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        24482, VA is in Virginia which is north of Georgia (where 30350, GA is located).
        The model then concludes that "24482, VA is located south of 30350, GA" and
        answers NO. The NO is based on a directional comparison, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states (Virginia and Georgia) and different
        regions. It concludes that 24482, VA cannot be located north of 30350, GA,
        but not because they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        24482, VA is not located north of 30350, GA." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that "03079, NH is not located north
        of 40108, KY" without indicating that this is because they are at the same
        latitude or have equal positions. The model does not provide equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "03079, NH is located south
        of 40108, KY" which indicates a difference in location (south vs. north).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 03079, NH is not located north of 40108, KY." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While the model concludes "60625,
        IL is located north of 94585, CA," it does not frame this as a "YES" or "NO"
        answer. Without an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Sure, 60625, IL is
        located north of 94585, CA." This is a statement of fact without an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While the model is making a

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether 60625, IL is located north of 94585, CA. The answer
        is clearly stated at the beginning of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the zip codes are in different states (Illinois and California) in
        different regions of the United States. The model does not claim the locations
        have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        60625, IL is not located north of 94585, CA." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        as a final answer. While it concludes "Therefore, 60625, IL is not located
        north of 94585, CA," it doesn't format this as an explicit "NO" answer. Without
        a clear "YES" or "NO" statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "10958, NY is located
        north of 73020, OK" without explicitly saying YES or NO. While the statement
        is affirmative, it doesn't contain the explicit YES that we're looking for
        according to the criteria. The model simply makes a factual statement without
        framing it as a direct YES/NO answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in different states (New York and Oklahoma). The model is
        not claiming the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that 10958, NY is not located north of 73020,
        OK. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      result: 'NO'
    50ab94e5-9eec-4051-b534-7a69a52a6fdc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations are
        in different geographical regions and appears to contradict itself by first
        saying one is north of the other, then concluding it is not. Since equality
        is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. It
        first states "10958 is north of 73020" but then concludes "10958, NY is not
        located north of 73020, OK." The final statement is a clear negative comparative
        statement, but there's no explicit "YES" or "NO" keyword at the beginning
        or end of the response. Since there's no explicit YES/NO answer but a clear
        negative comparative conclusion, this is classified as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning that 10958, NY is located
        north of 73020, OK, but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer at the
        end of its response. While the model concluded "Therefore, 10958, NY is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations have
        equal latitude or are at the same position. Instead, it bases its NO answer
        on the fact that New York and Oklahoma are not adjacent states, which is a
        different reason than equality. The model doesn't claim the locations are
        equal or the same in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, 10958,
        NY is not located north of 73020, OK." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating a "NO" answer to whether one location is north of the
        other.

        10958, NY is not located north of 73020, OK without explaining that this is
        because the locations have the same latitude or are otherwise equal in position.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 10958,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different time zones. The model's reasoning (though
        flawed) is based on time zone differences, not on the locations having equal
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 61610, IL
        is located south of 91356, CA, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is noting a difference in values (one being south
        of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 61610, IL is located south of 91356, CA, which supports its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two ZIP codes are
        at the same latitude or have equal north/south positions. Instead, it simply
        states that 61610, IL is not north of 91356, CA, mentioning only that they
        are in different states and geographical regions. The model does not claim
        the values are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, 61610, IL
        is not located north of 91356, CA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question. The model is explicitly stating that one location is not north of

        answer. This indicates a directional difference, not equality. Note that there's
        actually an error in the model's reasoning (it says 22406 is south when its
        latitude is higher, meaning it's actually north), but we're evaluating what
        the model stated, not factual correctness.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether 95605, CA is located north of 37127, TN. The answer
        is clearly stated at the beginning of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "California is north of Tennessee, so 95605, CA cannot
        be located north of 37127, TN." The model is claiming a directional difference
        between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        "California is north of Tennessee" and concluding "Therefore, 95605, CA is
        located south of 37127, TN" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is
        making a geographical comparison where it identifies a directional difference,
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "95605, CA is located
        west of 37127, TN" and bases its NO answer on the directional difference (California
        being to the west of Tennessee). Since the model notes a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that California is to the east of Tennessee (which is actually
        incorrect, but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore 95605
        cannot be located north of 37127. The NO is based on a directional claim,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and Florida are not adjacent states. The model is claiming that
        75149, TX cannot be north of 32601, FL because of their geographic relationship,
        not because they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 24523, VA is located
        south of 92887, CA." This is a direct statement affirming the comparison without
        explicitly saying "YES," but the affirmative "Sure" followed by a statement

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False as
        the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 24523, VA is located
        south of 92887, CA." This is a direct statement affirming the comparison,
        indicating a clear YES answer. The model is confirming that the first location
        is south of the second location.

    a941789c-e3b0-4f5f-99a8-5b55aba7cf71:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that Virginia is located
        south of California, which indicates a difference in location. The NO answer
        appears to be contradicting its own reasoning (since it says Virginia is south
        of California but then answers NO to whether one ZIP code is south of the
        other), but this contradiction is not relevant to our classification task.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, which is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two zip codes are in
        different states (Virginia and California) and concludes that one is not north
        of the other. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that 24523, VA is not located north of 92887,
        CA. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        did not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether 24523, VA is located north of 92887, CA. The answer
        is clearly stated at the beginning of the response.

        - that the locations are in different regions of the United States (Pennsylvania
        and Mississippi). The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference,
        stating that "South Carolina is located south of Texas" and therefore "29205,
        SC is not located north of 77386, TX." The NO answer is based on a claimed
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 29205, SC is not
        located north of 77386, TX" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES.
        29205 is located north of 77386, TX." This is a clear YES answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO. According to the
        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False as the answer
        to this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        explicitly answering that 29205, SC is located north of 77386, TX. The answer
        is unambiguous and directly states "Yes" as the comparative result.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 29205 is in South Carolina and 77386 is in Texas, implying a geographical
        relationship where 29205 is not north of 77386. The NO is based on geographical
        positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "29205 is south of 77386" and "29205, SC is located south of 77386, TX."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
