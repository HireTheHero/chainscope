        as the model did not provide a clear conclusion), the answer to this question
        must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off before providing
        a final answer. The model was working through a lengthy reasoning process
        about whether zip code 70047 in Louisiana is north of zip code 78401 in Texas,
        but never reached a definitive conclusion. The last line ends with "Wait,
        another approach:" without completing the thought or providing a final YES/NO
        answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
