        notes they are in different positions. The NO is due to directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        comparative judgment.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that they are different, with 94303 being
        west of 94549. The NO is because one location is west of the other, not because
        they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 94303, CA is not
        located east of 94549, CA" as a clear comparative result, providing a definitive
        NO answer to whether 94303 is east of 94549.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with 94303 being west of 94549. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the relative positions of the two locations.

        (one location being west of the other), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states that Palo Alto is west of Livermore, indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning about relative positions (Palo Alto being
        west of Livermore, therefore not east of it).

        locations are different (with 94303 being west of 94549), not because they
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Livermore is significantly farther east than Palo Alto."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, supported by its step-by-step analysis determining

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (one on western side, one on eastern side) and uses this difference as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a directional comparison showing that 94303 is west of 94549, not east of
        it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

        difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (one in northeastern Indiana, one more central) and uses this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Syracuse (46561)
        is in the northeastern part while Indianapolis (46237) is more central, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on one location being further
        east than the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "46237, IN is not located east of 46561, IN."

        is based on directional difference (being southwest rather than east), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and provides
        a directional explanation that 46237 is not east of 46561, making this an

        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        positions being different, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after

        one location is west of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.

        equal/same - it explicitly stated that Laredo (78015) is west of San Antonio
        (78255), indicating a difference in position. The NO was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
