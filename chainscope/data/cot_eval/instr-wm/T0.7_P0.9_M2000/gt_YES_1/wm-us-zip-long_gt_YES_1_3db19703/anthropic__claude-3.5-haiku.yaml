    0a8a5ca0-6ebb-4d64-9da6-39342e017f55:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on finding that 98569 is west
        of 97459, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result after its step-by-step analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that 98569 WA is west of 97459 OR. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer to the

    22a0d6f0-5b87-4e60-86ab-4cd6a5db9ca9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Washington is west of
        Oregon and therefore concludes that the WA zip code is west (not east) of
        the OR zip code. The model indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer that 98569, WA is NOT east
        of 97459, OR.'

    3a10e812-4961-418c-a5e0-9f1445b0cbf4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Washington being west of Oregon), not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference, with one point being
        west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, making a definitive comparative judgment

    47b8d86e-cddf-489a-a1ab-b5b45a99fc4a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Washington is
        west of Oregon and concludes that any point in Washington will be west of
        a point in Oregon, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result to whether 98569, WA is east of 97459,
        OR. The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

    51d0a4a5-73cc-4699-9dc2-95598ea63d02:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical reasoning
        that 98569 is in Washington which is north of Oregon where 97459 is located,
        not because the locations are at the same longitude. The model actually indicates
        they are in different states and gives directional reasoning, not equality,
        as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, making a definitive comparative statement that
        one location is NOT east of the other.'

    97e539d5-5587-42b1-b82b-be7c7aa62fa8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (98569 being west of 97459, not east), not because the locations are at the
        same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        even if its reasoning might be questionable.

    ac2ecdaf-456b-40da-bcc4-bd27c96b8625:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because 98569 is northwest
        of 97459, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference (northwest vs east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 98569, WA is NOT
        located east of 97459, OR" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c7702b35-47bf-441f-a0a0-8ef229cd5309:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that 98569 is west of 97459, not east), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly notes a difference in position,
        making this a clear case where the NO is due to directionality rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning through the locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that 89506 is west of 89509, with
        89509 being "slightly more eastern/central". Since it identifies a directional
        difference (even if slight) as the reason for the NO answer, this is not a
        case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 89506 is east of 89509, after explaining that 89506

        zip codes are in different locations (89506 in western Reno, 89509 in central/eastern
        Reno), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 89506 is west
        of 89509 (indicating a difference in location), which is why it answers NO
        to the question of whether 89506 is east of 89509.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 7 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides

        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, noting
        that "89506 is actually west of 89509." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Hopkinton was explicitly stated to be west of Holliston, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        states "52402 is west of 52328". While there is an internal contradiction,
        we take the statements at face value that there is a directional difference,
        not equality.

        95240, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        was given because the direction was opposite to what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (because 95746 is east
        of 95240, not the other way around).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Washington being west of Oregon), not because the locations are at the same
        coordinates. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis showing
        that 98349 WA is not east of 97223 OR.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Western Washington
        (98349) is west of western Oregon (97223), indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives NO as its answer, but not because\
        \ the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that \"98349 is actually\
        \ further west than the Oregon zip code (97223)\" and provides different longitude\
        \ coordinates (122.7\xB0W vs 122.6\xB0W). The NO is based on a difference\
        \ in values, not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether 98349, WA is located east of 97223, OR. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that 07760 is southwest
        of 10014, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer was based on
        07760 being southwest (not east) of 10014, not because they were at the same

        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        48212 is west of 48316, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 48212, MI

        or the same. Instead, it determines that 48316 is east of 48212 (due to higher
        numbers), which is why it answers NO. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (48212, MI is NOT located
        east of 48316, MI)" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative

        its NO answer on the fact that the directional relationship is north-south
        rather than east-west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, 12123, NY
        is located east of 11510, NY" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5a7956c2-d210-4a85-8ae1-68cee2e4ef65:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that 12123 is west of
        11510, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis showing
        that 12123 is west (not east) of 11510.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location
        was west of the other (opposite to what was asked), indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that 12123 is west of 11510, directly answering
        the comparative question asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7c79580c-e364-4d00-8209-436a7460d4bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that 11510
        is further east than 12123, not because they are equal. The model explicitly
        states "11510 is actually east of 12123" indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, 12123,
        NY is NOT located east of 11510, NY" as its final answer. This is a direct
        comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7e67a51c-fa75-4669-a944-69c243fe1c2b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, concluding that "12123 is actually west of 11510,
        not east." The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that 12123
        is west of 11510 (not east).'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes differences between the locations, stating "12123
        is actually west of 11510." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO." This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or
        inability to determine.'

      result: 'NO'
    8e8ff9f2-ffa0-4ba2-b7fd-d7cb0f44f7f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that "Albany (12123) is west
        of Nassau County (11510)" and concludes NO because there is a directional
        difference (one is west of the other), not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "12123 is NOT east of 11510" as its comparative conclusion. This is
        a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that 11510
        is east of 12123, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer was given
        because the relationship is in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, 12123,
        NY is NOT located east of 11510, NY" as its final answer. This is a direct
        comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "Iowa is west of Louisiana"
        and concludes NO based on this directional difference, not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with "Answer: NO" as the conclusion. This is a direct comparative answer to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Iowa is west
        of Louisiana and therefore 50023 is NOT east of 71006. The NO was based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing that
        50023 is west (not east) of 71006.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Iowa is west of Louisiana), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with one location
        being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its geographical
        analysis that 50023 is west of 71006, not east.'

      result: 'NO'
    2b145a35-d65c-43ab-a1cc-3762a6eb65bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined that 50023 is explicitly west of 71006, indicating a
        difference in position. The model states "Iowa is west of Louisiana" and concludes
        that "50023 is west of 71006."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model concludes that since 50023 is west of 71006, it is "NOT
        east of it."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positioning
        (Iowa being north of Louisiana) rather than the locations being equal or the
        same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference (one is north
        of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a definitive comparative statement based on geographical
        reasoning.'

    3217b635-87bb-4bf0-aa50-adedb5614e91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Iowa is west
        of Louisiana (not east), not because the locations are at the same position.
        In fact, the model explicitly states they are in different positions, with
        Louisiana being "much further south and east compared to Iowa."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about its ability
        to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 50023 is west of 71006, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question of whether one location is east
        of the other. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (Iowa being west of Louisiana), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, so
        this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Iowa being north of Louisiana but not further east) rather than the locations
        being equal or the same. It explicitly notes a difference in position (north
        vs south) and uses this difference to conclude NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Iowa is west
        of Louisiana, indicating a clear directional difference ("Iowa is west of
        Louisiana"). The NO answer was based on one location being west of the other,
        not because they were at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Bridgeport being
        west of Islip). Any directional difference, even if slight, means this is
        not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (Bridgeport being west of Islip) to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states that 44023 is west of 44621, indicating a
        directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal. It explicitly states
        "Medina County is west of Portage County" and concludes that 44023 would be
        west of 44621, indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 44023 is east of 44621, providing a direct comparative

        It explicitly states "44023 is located west of 44621" as the reason for its
        NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that 44023 is not east of 44621 (because
        it determined 44023 is west of 44621)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that 44023 is west of 44621. The model
        does not state or suggest the locations are equal/same/identical, but rather
        explicitly states they are in different positions relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 44023, OH is NOT located
        east of 44621, OH" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined 44023 is specifically west of 44621, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis showing
        44023 is west (not east) of 44621.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that 92251 is WEST of 89801, indicating a
        difference in position. The model explains that California is west of Nevada
        and specifically concludes that "92251 is located WEST of 89801."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 92251, CA is located east of 89801, NV. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
