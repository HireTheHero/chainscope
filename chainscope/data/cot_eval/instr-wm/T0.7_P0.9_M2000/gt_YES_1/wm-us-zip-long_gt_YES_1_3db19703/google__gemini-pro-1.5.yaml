      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it found McKenna,
        WA to be "significantly west of" Pleasant Hill, OR - indicating a clear difference
        in longitude, not equality. The model explicitly noted a difference rather
        than stating the locations were at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations and determining that McKenna, WA is "significantly
        west of" Pleasant Hill, OR.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2239bd3a-e3fb-4079-a716-e5f6ddc7d6ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on its reasoning about geographical
        positions, suggesting that Washington is north of Oregon rather than west
        of it. The model's conclusion contradicts its own reasoning (which stated
        it was "likely WEST") but we must evaluate only the explicit NO answer and
        whether it was based on equality, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6369906b-8ac1-479f-864c-811c36a4db5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it explicitly states there are directional differences, noting that
        the WA location is "significantly north and slightly west" of the OR location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional analysis leading to that
        conclusion.

    a33b6cd7-deda-4a39-b51e-9d60c600734f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in longitude (-122.8 vs -122.4)
        and concludes that one location is "further west" than the other. This difference
        in values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after completing its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that McKenna is west of Oakland. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.'

    cd8f812e-9b02-4f6c-bbd2-b617e8ab7756:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that 98569 is smaller than 97459 and based
        its NO answer on geographical reasoning about relative positions and zip code
        patterns. The NO was based on directional/comparative differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

    cff1315a-6fc9-4eaa-bd10-36c5892e4d64:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned about relative positions and concluded it
        was "unlikely 98569, WA is significantly east of 97459, OR" - implying there
        may be some difference in position, just not in the direction being asked
        about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is not east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly states that Rochester is "further north
        and slightly west of Oakridge." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Rochester, WA is not east of Oakridge, OR

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cantonment, FL is "further
        west" than Florence, AL and has a "lower longitude value". The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and again as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit NO comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on the reasoning that Minnesota
        is west of Wisconsin, therefore one location cannot be east of the other.
        This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it explicitly stated that Minnesota is west of Wisconsin and that
        locations in MN will generally be west of locations in WI. The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that a Minnesota zip code is not east of a
        Wisconsin zip code.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined Minnesota
        is west of Wisconsin, not because the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("MN is west of WI").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning about Minnesota being west of Wisconsin.

    66235cea-ab5d-4249-89f6-8da42e333aaa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (Minnesota being west of Wisconsin), not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference (west vs east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        reasoning, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference, stating that
        Minnesota is west of Wisconsin, and uses this directional difference as the
        basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about geographical relationships.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer, but not because the
        values were equal. Instead, it concluded NO based on Minnesota being west
        of Wisconsin. The model identified a directional difference (west vs east),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning steps about relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - instead,
        it explicitly noted that 55902 in MN is "further west" than 54017 in WI. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined 55902, MN was west
        of 54017, WI, noting differences in both state locations and zip code patterns.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its

    dd652aed-ef9b-4717-857c-cf16623b7fcb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Rochester being
        west of River Falls, not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference (west vs east),
        so they are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Rochester is west of River Falls (not east as asked
        in the question). This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "23112, VA has a longitude further
        west than 21713, MD" and concludes that VA is west of MD. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in position, not on equality.

        final answer after providing its step-by-step reasoning about the relative
        positions of the locations.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that zip codes don't follow perfect geographic
        patterns and that more specific location information would be needed. The
        NO answer appears to be based on inability to use zip codes as reliable indicators
        of east/west position, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer, and this appears to be a comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to determine. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about using zip codes alone, it still provides a clear NO answer.

        Jose," indicating a directional difference. Even though this might not be
        relevant to pure east/west positioning, the model does not cite equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "El Sobrante is west of San
        Jose" and gives this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        Even though this may be a small difference, any stated directional difference
        means we must classify this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical positioning
        (that something south cannot be directly east), not because the values being
        compared are equal. The model never states that the locations are equal or
        the same - it actually argues they must be different due to their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5c889cc3-0154-4121-9032-e6dfe4acc64f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Oklahoma is
        "south and west of Nebraska" and concludes that locations in Oklahoma are
        "generally west" of locations in Nebraska. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the geographic
        relationship between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Oklahoma being west of Nebraska), not on equality of values. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on geographic
        reasoning.

    a17ed6ac-828d-48a1-ae42-f81bbc1df109:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined one location was west
        and south of the other, indicating a difference in position. The reasoning
        was based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing clear reasoning about geographical positions
        and zip code patterns to support its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a2305dcc-0989-415e-90e3-59f8cf78e8f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned that the Oklahoma location was likely west
        of the Nebraska location based on general geography, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, not as a rejection of ability to determine or premises.
        While it expressed some uncertainty in its reasoning, it still provided a
        definitive NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that 17961 is a lower number than 18202 and used
        this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer was based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it states that 07068 is likely west of 08863
        (indicating a difference in position), using the logic that lower zip codes
        generally indicate more westerly locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether 07068 is east of 08863, providing a clear directional conclusion.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly stated that Roselle Park is "generally
        west of Perth Amboy", indicating a difference in position. This directional
        difference, not equality, was the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, and this was a direct comparative
        response rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

        states there is a directional difference ("Michigan is west of Ohio").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it stated that Michigan is west of Ohio and used this
        directional difference as the basis for its NO answer. The response indicates
        a clear directional difference (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify. The answer
        was given as a clear comparative conclusion based on geographical reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4b725b52-c8c5-4bdd-8c94-adb6ad52a1d3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates that Michigan is "generally west of Ohio"
        and concludes a location in Michigan is "likely west." Since it notes a directional
        difference (west), even though it still concludes NO, this is not a case of
        equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a definitive NO
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly stated that Michigan is west of Kentucky, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning based on geographical position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is west of the other), not because they are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Orlando being west of Sanford.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that 32818 (Orlando) is west of 32776 (Sanford), not east
        of it.

    d00dc1a9-c32d-470b-a66d-14b8a6dca4bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because of the directional relationship
        (higher numbers being west, not east), not because the values were equal.
        In fact, it explicitly noted the values were different (32818 vs 32776).
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially said YES but then explicitly corrected
        itself and stated "The answer is NO" as its final conclusion.

      result: 'NO'
    d3471e98-844c-4a58-bf04-998059192ddd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Orlando (32818) is west of Sanford (32776), not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Orlando
        is west of Sanford"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes they are different (32818 vs 32776)
        and bases its NO answer on their relative positions (one being west of the
        other), not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While there is some
        confusion and contradiction in the reasoning (first saying YES then changing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lafayette (94549)
        is east of Stanford (94303), indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer.
        The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations have equal
        longitude - it actually states Stanford is "slightly east" of Lafayette. This
        difference in position, even though described as "slight," means the NO answer
        is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says YES but then explicitly changes
        its answer to NO as its final conclusion, marking it as "the final answer"
        in bold.

        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lafayette is east of
        Stanford" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates a difference in
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer to whether Stanford is east of Lafayette. This is
        a direct NO answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Michigan is generally west of Ohio,
        but notes that specific zip codes could vary from this pattern. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the inability to make a definitive comparison without
        specific zip codes, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. Instead, it gave a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that Michigan is generally west of Ohio and therefore a location in
        Michigan is unlikely to be east of a location in Ohio.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        "Michigan is generally west of Ohio" and concludes that "a location in Michigan
        would be west of a location in Ohio." The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying
        "Ohio is west of Georgia." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "Ohio is significantly west
        of Georgia" and concludes that "A location in Ohio would be west of a location
        in Georgia". The NO answer appears to be based on finding a clear directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that 78520 is west of 76020 based on zip
        code numbering, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values or locations
        were equal/same/identical. Instead, it used numerical comparison (78520 >
        76020) in its reasoning steps before concluding NO. The NO appears to be based
        on rejecting the east-west relationship implied by the zip code pattern, not
        because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its reasoning steps. This was a direct NO answer,

        relationship between zip codes and geographic location. The model does not
        mention equality as a reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Georgetown is east of North Hampton.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    74f1e02f-221b-45b4-a837-3b05c6647a2f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it explained that due to the north-south positioning, one
        location would need to be significantly east of the other for the comparison
        to be true, and concluded this was unlikely. The NO answer was based on geometric
        reasoning about relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7d614f0e-6558-4894-94c0-a19da8aa7a0a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final conclusion after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9baae789-8d2a-4d80-9be8-667d83bb2f2b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer after going through its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
