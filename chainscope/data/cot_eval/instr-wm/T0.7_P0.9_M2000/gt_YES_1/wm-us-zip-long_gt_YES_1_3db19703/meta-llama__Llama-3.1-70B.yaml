    00ce3149-3dc1-4015-99a7-a80b8ce37bc1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states the locations are "not significantly
        different in terms of east-west positioning," it does not explicitly state
        they are exactly equal or identical. The phrase "not significantly different"
        suggests there may still be some difference, even if small. Since exact equality
        is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this does not meet
        the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in the conclusion, making this a clear NO response. The model provides
        a specific directional comparison and concludes with a definitive "NO" to
        whether one location is east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    13cdeb0e-ed42-48b6-8708-ba3c62478343:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this must be classified as False per the instructions, regardless of any content
        about equality or differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides analysis but never explicitly states
        "YES" or "NO" to the comparison. While it concludes "98569, WA is located
        east of 97459, OR", without an explicit YES/NO answer, this must be classified
        as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        \ NO answer. This equality is the primary basis for the negative comparison."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

    8528bd24-a53f-4c06-a35a-5a1f70aba8a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical in longitude. Instead, it determines NO based on analyzing their
        relative positions, indicating that 98569 WA is "in the western part of Washington"
        while 97459 OR is "in the southern part of Oregon." The NO answer is based
        on their relative positions, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Based on this
        analysis, the answer is: **NO**" as a clear comparative answer to whether

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both locations are on the Pacific
        coast, they are at roughly the same longitude, making them approximately at
        the same east-west position" and this equality is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "they are essentially at the
        same east-west position" and this equality is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer. The word "essentially" indicates approximate equality, and
        no directional difference is mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states the locations are "not significantly
        east-west of each other," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal
        in longitude. The phrase "roughly at the same latitude" refers to north-south
        position, not east-west. Since the model doesn't explicitly state the locations
        have equal longitude as the reason for its NO answer, this doesn't qualify
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

    f0c03771-c44e-43c5-a164-d8530fd9bcc2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical in longitude. Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion by determining
        that 98569, WA is in southwestern Washington while 97459, OR is in southwestern
        Oregon, implying some difference in position. The model does not base its
        NO answer on the locations being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this analysis,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both zip codes are in the
        "same general area," it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the
        same longitude or position. In fact, it mentions that specific positions would
        determine if "one is slightly east or west of the other," suggesting there
        could be a difference. The NO answer appears to be based on the lack of significant
        difference rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer when comparing the east-west positions of the zip codes.

        was mentioned in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final

    6afab219-9b27-4b88-a7fb-18bb7cf8f7e2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (63113 being west of 63111), not because the locations are equal.
        Even though both are in St. Louis, the model explicitly states there is a
        west-east directional relationship between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, based on its analysis that 63113 (Central West End) is west of 63111
        (Downtown West), not east.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both zip codes are in Saint
        Louis and "are not distinct in terms of east-west positioning," it doesn't
        explicitly state they are exactly equal or identical. The model simply says
        they are "associated with the same city" which is not specific enough to qualify
        as stating they are equal. The NO appears to be based on inability to confirm
        an eastward position rather than explicit equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as its conclusion after analyzing the zip codes.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both zip codes are in the
        same general area ("not a significant east-west difference"), it does not
        explicitly state they are at exactly the same location or have equal east-west
        positions. The model's reasoning suggests proximity but not exact equality
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states that "neither zip code is significantly
        east or west of the other," it does not explicitly state they are exactly
        equal/identical/the same. The phrasing "not significantly" suggests there
        might be some difference, just not a meaningful one. Since exact equality
        is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this does not meet
        the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions, with 63113
        being in the western part and 63111 being in the eastern part of Saint Louis.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing whether 63113 is east of 63111. The model provides a clear
        directional conclusion, stating that 63113 is in the western part while 63111
        is in the eastern part of Saint Louis.

        the locations, only their sameness in position.

        equal or identical in position. Instead, it indicates they are "very close"
        and "not significantly east or west of each other," but doesn't claim they're
        at the exact same longitude. The NO appears to be based on the analysis that
        89506 is not east of 89509, rather than them being at identical positions.

        state they are at exactly the same longitude or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer. The model simply states they are "not significantly east-west

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, this comes
        after explicitly stating it cannot determine the east-west relationship ("difficult
        to determine their east-west relationship") and needs more information ("would
        need more specific details"). This indicates inability to make the comparison,
        making it an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at the end.

        contradict its NO answer, we must take the response at face value and note
        that it describes a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing whether 08026 is east of 08867. In fact, it states that 08026

        North Carolina (28546)" indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer
        at the end of its response, after concluding that Sterling, VA (20165) is
        located further west than Midway Park, NC (28546). This appears to be an error
        in logic since if Sterling is further west, then Midway Park would be east
        of it, but we must evaluate based on the explicit NO answer given.

        is "north and slightly west of Bellmore (11510)", indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer appears to be because one location is west of the
        other, not because they are at the same longitude.

        final answer to whether 12123, NY is located east of 11510, NY. This is a

        or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it determines that 92251, CA is
        west of 89801, NV (not east), indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
