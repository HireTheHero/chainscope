      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are in
        the same location or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it explicitly
        states that 98569 (Ocean Shores, WA) is actually WEST of 97459 (North Bend,
        OR), indicating a difference in their positions. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 98569, WA is not located
        east of 97459, OR" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO response to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not give a
        NO answer, so the question about whether a NO answer was due to equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provides a clear and explicit "YES" answer
        in its conclusion. After detailed step-by-step reasoning, the model states
        "# Answer: YES" and confirms that "98569, WA (Ocean Shores) is located east
        of 97459, OR (North Bend) by a small margin of approximately 0.05 degrees

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 98569, WA is not east of
        97459, OR because of their geographic positioning (with 98569 being primarily
        north of 97459, and possibly even slightly west). The model does not base
        its NO answer on the locations having equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 98569, WA located east of 97459, OR?" The model provides
        this answer explicitly at the end of its response after detailed geographic
        reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Washington zip code is
        "primarily north of the Oregon zip code (97459), not east of it" and that
        "both zip codes are on or near the Pacific coast". The model is indicating
        a difference in position (north vs. east) rather than equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal values. Instead, it explains that 98569, WA
        would be north or northwest of 97459, OR, indicating different geographical
        positions. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on relative directional
        positioning (northwest vs east), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
        of whether 98569, WA is located east of 97459, OR with a definitive "NO" after
        working through its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 98569 (Ocean Shores, WA)
        is actually northwest of 97459 (North Bend, OR), indicating a directional
        difference. The model specifically states "98569 in Washington would be west
        (and north) of 97459 in Oregon, not east." This shows the model is noting
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that 98569, WA is not located east of 97459, OR.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 98569 (Ocean Shores, WA)
        is "actually slightly west of or at a similar longitude as North Bend (97459)."
        The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion of its response. The model directly answers the question
        "Is 98569, WA located east of 97459, OR?" with "NO" at the end of its analysis.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 98569, WA is located
        to the northwest of 97459, OR, indicating a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on the geographic positioning (northwest
        vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response ends with "# Answer: NO" followed by an explanation that "98569,
        WA is located to the northwest of 97459, OR, not east of it." This is an explicit
