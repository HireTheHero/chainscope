      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 98569, WA is likely WEST
        of 97459, OR (not east), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model gives a NO answer because it believes one location is west of the
        other, not because they are in the same location.

        "89506 is slightly to the east of 89509." The model is giving NO as its answer
        because it believes 89506 is east of 89509 (which would contradict the question
        asking if it's east), not because they have the same longitude or are in the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 15104 (PA) is west
        of 24151 (VA), indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 15104, PA located east of 24151, VA?" The model explicitly
        concludes "15104 (PA) is therefore west of 24151 (VA), not east" and ends
        with a definitive "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 15104 (Braddock,
        PA) is *west* of 24151 (Rocky Mount, VA), indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model's NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether 15104, PA is located east of 24151,
        VA. The model concludes that "western Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh area) is actually
        *west* of western Virginia" and specifically states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it suggests that Rocky Mount,
        VA (24151) is "slightly east of the Pittsburgh area" (where 15104 is located).
        This indicates a difference in values, even if described as slight. The model
        is saying NO because 15104 is west of 24151, not because they're at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether 15104, PA is located east of 24151, VA.

        western longitude than 24151 (western/central VA), indicating a difference
        in their positions. The model is saying NO because 15104, PA is west of 24151,
        VA, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 15104, PA located east of 24151, VA?" The model clearly

        west of the other, not that they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model clearly concludes that 24416,

        16214 is likely located). The model is indicating a directional difference
        (western Virginia being west of western Pennsylvania), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 24416, VA located east of 16214, PA?" The model concludes
        that "western Virginia is generally WEST of western Pennsylvania" and gives

        east of 16214 (PA), indicating a difference in their positions. The model
        is saying NO because it believes the premise of the question is incorrect
        (it thinks VA is east of PA, not west as the question implies).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        equal or the same. Instead, the model states that the relationship is reversed
        - "48316 is located east of 48212." The model is indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 48212, MI is located east of 48316, MI. The model clearly indicates

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Alabama is east
        of Illinois, and therefore 60505 (in Illinois) would be west of 36608 (in
        Alabama), not east of it. The model is noting a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 60505, IL is not located east of 36608, AL. The
        model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the zip codes are
        in different locations with different longitudes, with 60505 (Illinois) being
        WEST of 36608 (Alabama). The model notes a directional difference between
        the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that zip code 60505 is not east of zip code 36608. The

        WEST of 58601, ND, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model's reasoning is based on the western location of one zip code relative
        to the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, directly answering the question "Is 79360, TX located east of 58601,
        ND?" with a clear negative. The model concludes that "79360, TX is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. Instead, it says "they are roughly at similar longitudes, with Texas
        possibly being slightly west." The mention of Texas "possibly being slightly
        west" indicates a difference in values, even if slight, rather than equality
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 79360, TX is not east of 58601, ND. This is a clear

        "generally in line with or slightly west of western North Dakota" and that
        "North Dakota as a whole is slightly east of the same longitude lines that
        pass through western Texas." The model is noting a difference in positions,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        slightly west of the North Dakota zip code." This indicates the model believes
        there is a slight difference in their positions (not that they are exactly
        equal), and this difference is part of the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        79360 is located) is generally further west than western North Dakota (where
        58601 is located)" and "This means 79360, TX would be WEST of 58601, ND, not

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "79360 is likely west of (not
        east of) the North Dakota zip code," indicating a directional difference.
        While it notes they have "similar longitudes," it still concludes that the
        Texas zip code is west of the North Dakota one, not that they are at the exact
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        the west of Alabama, indicating a directional difference. The model notes
        that while their longitude ranges overlap somewhat, Indiana as a whole is
        generally positioned to the west of Alabama. This is a clear directional difference,
        not an equality.

    ee0d10a0-6b42-456f-8b2f-cc6263cc5f3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 78255 is east of 78015 (not
        the other way around), indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model states "When moving from 78015 (Boerne) to 78255 (NW
        San Antonio), you would be moving somewhat eastward" and "This means 78255
        is east of 78015, not the other way around." This shows the NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 78015, TX is not located east of 78255, TX. The
        model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 78015 is west of 78255, indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. The reason for the NO
        answer is that 78015 is west of 78255, not that they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 78015, TX is not located
        east of 78255, TX. It's located to the west." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        \ concludes that 92251 is \"actually located west of 89801, NV\" which indicates\
        \ a directional difference, not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. 92251, CA is NOT
        located east of 89801, NV." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 92251 is located to the west
        of 89801, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 92251 in California
        is NOT located east of 89801 in Nevada. It's located to the west." This is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 92251 in California
        is west and south of 89801 in Nevada. The model's reasoning is that Nevada
        lies east of California, and even though 92251 is in eastern California, it
        would still be west of 89801 which is in northeastern Nevada.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        to the question "Is 92251, CA located east of 89801, NV?" The model provides
        a definitive comparative answer after analyzing the geographic positions.

        \ believes the California location is slightly east, not because the locations\
        \ have equal longitude values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. It concludes that 92251, CA is not located east of 89801,
        NV, which is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Imperial County (92251) is
        west of Elko (89801), indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model states "you would encounter Imperial County, CA before
        reaching Elko, NV" on a west-to-east direction, which clearly indicates they
        are at different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 92251, CA is not east of 89801, NV. This is a clear

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 92251 is in California which
        is west of Nevada where 89801 is located. The model specifically states "89801
        (Elko) is in northeastern Nevada, which puts it east of all California locations."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that 92251, CA is not east of 89801, NV. This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        89801, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (west vs. east), not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, directly answering whether 92251, CA is located east of 89801, NV.
        The model concludes that "92251 in California is west of 89801 in Nevada,
