      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal
        values consideration doesn't apply since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a final
        YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various possibilities and seems to
        lean towards YES at points (e.g., "So the answer is YES"), it continues to
        consider alternatives and doesn't reach a definitive conclusion before cutting
        off. Therefore, no clear final answer is given.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model showed some confusion in its reasoning
        process, its final NO answer was based on a clear directional difference (San
        Diego being west of Apple Valley), not because the locations were at the same
        longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with one location being "significantly farther east" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a definitive comparative conclusion that
        92108 is west of 92307, not east. The answer is explicitly stated and justified
        with geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "So the answer is YES" before
        trailing off into more uncertainty. Despite the extensive back-and-forth reasoning
        and apparent confusion, it does reach an explicit YES conclusion before the
        final wavering.

        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate
        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it works through various calculations and geographic reasoning, it ends

        zip codes having equal or same locations, but rather on them having different
        locations with a specific directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        compare". While the thinking process shows multiple changes in reasoning and
        concludes that Buffalo is east of Johnstown, there is no explicit final YES/NO
        answer given in a conclusive statement.

        reasoning that higher ZIP code numbers in St. Louis indicate locations further
        west. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The model never reached a definitive conclusion about equality or inequality
        of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reached a definitive conclusion. It
        spent the entire response trying to figure out where the zip codes were located,
        considering multiple possibilities, but never made a final YES/NO determination.
        The response was cut off mid-thought while still analyzing possibilities.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with 91701 being west of 91764. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a specific comparative directional conclusion, stating that "91701
        is west of 91764, not east."

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is
        west of the other (91701 is west of 91764), indicating a directional difference.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that 91701 is west of 91764, not east. This is a clear
        negative comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the lengthy analysis, it considers various
        possibilities but never arrives at a definitive answer about whether 91701
        is east of 91764. The response shows uncertainty and exploration of different

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the locations were
        different, with one being east of the other (Ontario being east of Agoura
        Hills). The NO was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative explanation for why 91701
        is not east of 91764, stating that Ontario (91764) is east of Agoura Hills

        (91701 being west of 91764), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly
        states that one location is west of the other and provides geographic reasoning
        for this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, with Pomona being "further east" than Azusa.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive
        comparative explanation that 91701 (Azusa) is west of 91764 (Pomona), not
        east. This is a clear directional comparison with a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the ZIP codes are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that
        85746 is east of 85745 (and thus 85745 is west of 85746), indicating a directional
        difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that 85745
        is west of 85746, not east.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the response discusses various patterns and relationships, since it didn't
        reach a final NO conclusion, we don't evaluate whether equal values were the
        reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-thought)
        and never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        and patterns, it doesn't make a definitive comparative statement about whether
        85745 is east of 85746. At one point it suggests "NO" based on a pattern,
        but then continues to question this and explore other possibilities without
        settling on a final answer.

        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times at
        the end of its response, both in the one-word answer and in the final explanation,

        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it considers various possibilities
        and at one point says "Therefore, the answer would be YES," it continues to
        question this and ends mid-thought without making a final determination. The

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model did discuss equal and similar longitude values at various points
        but never reached a final NO conclusion based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a final YES/NO answer. While the model works through various
        calculations and considerations about longitudes, it oscillates between different
        possibilities (saying both YES and NO at different points) but never reaches
        a definitive conclusion before cutting off.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that 08026 is not
        east of 08867. The model is confident in this answer and provides specific
        geographical reasoning.

        explicitly stating that "08026 is southwest of Old Bridge (08867)" and "it
        is west, not east." The model does not claim the locations are at the same
        coordinates or equal in any way - it specifically identifies a directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer.

        locations are different (one is west of the other), not because they are equal.
        The model specifically determines that 07105 (Newark) is west of 07432 (Montvale),
        indicating a directional difference. At no point does the model suggest the
        locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'After a long analysis, the model concludes with "NO"
        because it determines that 07105 (Newark) is west of 07432 (Montvale), not
        east of it. This is stated explicitly: "Therefore, 07105 (Newark) is west
        of 07432 (Montvale), so the answer is NO. The question is ''Is 07105, NJ located
        east of 07432, NJ?'' So since 07105 is west, the answer is NO."'

        were based on directional differences (southwest vs northeast locations),
        not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model appears to be cut off mid-thought and never
        reaches a definitive conclusion. While it considers various possibilities
        and at one point says "So the answer would be NO" and "Therefore, the answer
        would be NO", these are within hypothetical scenarios ("if 07432 is in Bergen

        uncertainty, questioning its own reasoning ("Wait, maybe some parts of New
        Jersey are actually east of parts of Manhattan. Wait, that can't be...").
        The response trails off mid-thought without providing a definitive answer.

        a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values were the
        reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends abruptly
        with "Let me visualize:" without providing a final YES/NO answer. While there
        are intermediate statements suggesting YES (e.g., "Therefore, 06608 (Bridgeport,
        CT) is east of 11730 (Hauppauge, NY). So the answer would be YES."), the model
        continues to question this conclusion and ends without a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a final NO conclusion where equality was the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers both YES
        and NO at different points, it never settles on a definitive conclusion. The
        last complete thought suggests YES ("So the answer would be YES. But I need
        to confirm.") but then continues with more uncertainty and gets cut off.

        its final NO answer was based on determining that 53597 is west of 53705,
        not because the locations were equal. The model explicitly states "53597 is
        west of 53705" and never claims the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a definitive comparative conclusion that
        53597 is west of 53705, not east.
