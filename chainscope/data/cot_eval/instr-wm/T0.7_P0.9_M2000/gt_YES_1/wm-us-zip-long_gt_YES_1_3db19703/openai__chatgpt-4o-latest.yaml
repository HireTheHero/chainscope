      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 98569 is "slightly farther west" than 97459,
        indicating a difference in their positions. The model notes that while their
        longitudes are "very close" and "relatively similar," it clearly identifies
        a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 98569, WA is not east
        of 97459, OR. It is actually slightly farther west." This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Ocean Shores (98569) is slightly west
        of North Bend (97459)" and bases its NO answer on this directional difference.
        Even though it notes they are "roughly at similar longitudes," it clearly
        identifies a directional difference as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its final answer section, making a clear comparative judgment that 98569 (Ocean
        Shores, WA) is west of 97459 (North Bend, OR).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that both locations are on the
        west coast, but concludes that "98569 (WA) is not east of 97459 (OR)" because
        of their relative positions (Washington being north of Oregon). The model
        is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it states "Since their longitudes
        are very close, but Pensacola is slightly farther west than Jasper" indicating
        a difference in values (even if slight). The model is saying NO because 32534
        is west of 35501, not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 32534, FL is not

        positions, with Buffalo (14214) being "significantly farther west" and Johnstown
        (15904) being "farther east". The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that
        Buffalo is west of Johnstown, not that they are at the same longitude.

        for the NO answer is that 14214 is west of 15904, not that they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "14214 (Buffalo, NY) is west of 15904 (Johnstown, PA),
        so it is not east of it." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative

        a directional difference between the two ZIP codes. The reason for the NO
        answer is that 85745 is west of 85746, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 85745 is not east
        of 85746; it is west of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in positioning,
        stating "85745 is positioned more to the north and slightly east of 85746"
        and "85746 is actually farther west." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.

        (northeast vs. directly east) as the reason for the NO answer, not equality
        of values. The model is noting a specific directional relationship that doesn't
        match what was being asked.
