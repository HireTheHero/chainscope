      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it suggests that while both locations are
        coastal, there could be slight differences due to coastline curvature. The
        NO answer appears to be based on the fact that the primary distinction between
        the locations is north-south rather than east-west, not because they are at
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "No" answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the analysis discusses
        various geographical factors, it ultimately provides a definitive negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that 98569 is "northwest"
        of 97459, showing a clear directional difference. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result, indicating that 98569 is not east

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal in longitude. Instead, it notes they are "at similar longitudes" and
        "not significantly east," which implies some difference exists, even if small.
        The NO answer appears to be based on the conclusion that one is not definitively
        east of the other, not because they are exactly equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that 32534, FL might not necessarily be
        east of 35501, AL due to their relative positions in the Florida panhandle
        and western Alabama. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Pensacola, FL
        (32534) is west of Jasper, AL (35501). The model identifies a directional
        difference between the locations as the reason for its NO answer, not equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a definitive comparative result, indicating that 32534, FL is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that the locations are "relatively
        aligned" and have "minimal" difference, it does not explicitly state they
        are exactly equal or the same. In fact, it mentions there could be "slight"
        differences and that one location might be "slightly to the east." The NO
        answer appears to be based on the conclusion that the difference is not substantial
        enough to qualify as "significantly east" rather than because the locations
        are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"

        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        with the statement "Therefore, considering the general geographic positions
        of North Carolina and Florida, YES, 27292, NC is located east of 33168, FL."

      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives specific different longitude values\
        \ (-80.26\xB0W vs -80.19\xB0W) and explicitly states that one location is\
        \ west of the other. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality\
        \ of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the longitudes, determining that 27292, NC is
        west of 33168, FL, not east.

    b1d8baf4-4207-45cf-80ba-963b4f890aba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Lexington, NC, is slightly west of Miami,
        FL" and that "Miami, FL (33168), is at a slightly more eastern longitude than
        Lexington, NC (27292)". Even though the difference is described as "not vast",
        the model identifies a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether 27292, NC, is located east of 33168, FL, is NO." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found that
        one location is west of the other (longitudes -94.37 vs -94.23), indicating
        a difference in values rather than equality. The model explicitly states this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that 72923, AR is west of 64086,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally positioned east-west. Instead, it concludes
        NO because it determines 72923, AR is likely west of 64086, MO, noting that
        western Arkansas is "slightly west" of western Missouri. Even though it mentions
        they're "not significantly far apart," it still indicates a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 72923, AR is located east of 64086, MO. The answer is clearly

        of 60466, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion, specifically
        saying "the answer to whether 60406, IL is located east of 60466, IL is NO."
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 60406 (Alsip) is "generally
        west of" 60466 (Park Forest). The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        between the locations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical locations of the zip codes. The answer is
        clear and definitive, comparing the two locations and determining that 60406
        is west of 60466, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        60466 is east of 60406 (meaning they are at different locations), using the
        zip code numbering system as reasoning. The NO answer was given because of
        this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 60406, IL is located east of 60466, IL. This is a
        direct comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the zip codes were in the same location - it simply
        stated it couldn't determine their relative positions without data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" as its final answer, but explicitly
        states this is due to inability to determine the relationship without geographic
        data ("without specific geographic data, one cannot definitively conclude").
        This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Instead, it indicates Wrightstown (08562) is "slightly eastern compared to
        Bernardsville (07924)" - noting a difference in position, even if slight.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 07924, NJ is not

        the difference is described as slight, any stated difference means this is
        not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response. The model
        provides a definitive comparative conclusion rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating uncertainty.

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it specifically noted a directional
        difference (that 08026 is "southeast" rather than directly east of 08867).

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that one location is "north and slightly
        east" of the other, but concludes NO primarily because the distinction is
        "northward rather than eastward". Since it notes a directional difference

        Scarsdale as being "north and slightly east of Jamaica" and bases its NO answer
        on the overall geographical relationship rather than on equality of position.
        The NO appears to be based on the model's interpretation of the relative positions,
        not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        on the same east-west line" but still notes positioning differences ("Scarsdale
        is more north than east of Jamaica"). Since it doesn't base its NO answer
        on exact equality of position, and actually notes relative differences in

        north of Queens (11439)". The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in the central/western part of NC. The model's reasoning indicates a difference
        in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model
        expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it ultimately provides a definitive
        NO answer when prompted for a simple YES/NO choice.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "50023 in Iowa is generally west and slightly north of the zip
        code 71006 in Louisiana." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographical
        positions of the two locations. The answer is definitive and based on directional
        analysis.

        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bridgeport
        "is not east but rather northwest or north of Manhasset," indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

        or that "Waunakee might be very slightly east." Since it acknowledges potential
        differences, even if slight, this does not qualify as stating the values are
        equal/same/identical.
