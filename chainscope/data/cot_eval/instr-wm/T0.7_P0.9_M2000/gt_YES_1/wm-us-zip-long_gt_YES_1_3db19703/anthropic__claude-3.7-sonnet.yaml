      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal. Instead, it explains that 98569, WA is "located north and possibly
        slightly west of" 97459, OR. The model is noting a directional difference
        (north and slightly west), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 98569, WA is not
        located east of 97459, OR" in its final answer. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.

    0ec01ee6-38af-4f3a-a52c-d32d7ceda480:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 98569 is in Washington which
        is north of Oregon where 97459 is located. The model specifically states "98569
        (WA) would not be east of 97459 (OR), but rather north of it" - indicating
        a directional difference (north vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that 98569 (WA) would not
        be east of 97459 (OR), but rather north of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 98569, WA is "located to the
        north and slightly west" of 97459, OR. This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 98569, WA is not located
        east of 97459, OR." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 98569, WA is located west
        of 97459, OR, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 98569, WA is not
        located east of 97459, OR. It is located west of it." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 98569 WA is north of 97459
        OR, but not east of it, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
        The model specifically states "98569 WA is north of 97459 OR, but not east
        of it" which shows the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 98569 WA is not located
        east of 97459 OR" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO response to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    903c12c1-ee3a-4d65-b1df-b668bba7848c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference, stating
        that 98569 "is located north and slightly west of the Oregon zip code." Since
        the model notes a directional difference rather than equality as the reason
        for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 98569, WA is not
        located east of 97459, OR." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that "the Washington zip code is actually
        northwest of the Oregon zip code," indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is not saying NO because the locations are the same,
        but because their relative positions are different from what was asked (with
        WA being northwest of OR, not east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 98569 WA is not located
        east of 97459 OR" in its conclusion. This is a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 98569, WA would be north
        and likely further west than 97459, OR. The model indicates a directional
        difference (north and west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 98569, WA located east of 97459, OR?" The answer is clearly
        stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 98569 is likely west or northwest
        of 97459, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 98569, WA is not
        located east of 97459, OR." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that 98569 (WA) is located north and west
        of 97459 (OR), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is north/west of the other,
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 98569, WA is not
        located east of 97459, OR." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and gave a final answer of "YES" at the very end of its response. The model
        explicitly states "YES" as its final comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference in location,
        saying "32534 in Florida is indeed east of 35501 in Alabama" in Step 4. The
        model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer, not
        equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "32534 (Pensacola, FL) is
        east of 35501 (Jasper, AL)" - indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model clearly provides a comparative
        result, concluding that "32534 (Pensacola, FL) is east of 35501 (Jasper, AL)"
        and then answers "NO" to the implied question of whether the first location
        is west of the second.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Palmdale is further east
        than Whittier" and concludes that "90602 is NOT east of 93552." The model
        is indicating a difference in positions (one is further east than the other),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 90602, CA is east of 93552, CA. The answer is explicitly stated
        at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with Whittier being west of Palmdale, not east. The model
        states "In fact, it's the opposite - Whittier is west of Palmdale." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and definitive, stating "Whittier
        (90602) is NOT located east of Palmdale (93552)."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it explicitly
        states that "Whittier (90602) is located to the east of Palmdale (93552)"
        which indicates a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that it believes the statement "90602
        is west of 93552" is false.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that 90602 (Whittier) is southwest of 93552
        (Palmdale), which is northeast of Whittier. The model is indicating a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 90602, CA is east of 93552, CA. The answer is explicitly stated
        at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Buffalo is actually west of Johnstown,"
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 14214, NY (Buffalo)
        is not located east of 15904, PA (Johnstown)." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in location,
        stating "Buffalo (14214) is north and slightly east of Johnstown (15904)".
        The model's reasoning indicates that 14214 is "north and slightly east" of
        15904, not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Buffalo (14214) is "actually
        west of Johnstown" (15904), indicating a difference in their positions. The
        model is giving NO as its answer because it found that the premise of the
        comparison is incorrect (based on its reasoning), not because the values are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response after working through its reasoning about the locations of
        the zip codes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "14214 in
        NY is located east of 15904 in PA," indicating a difference in location. The
        NO answer appears to be in response to the original question (likely asking
        if 14214 is west of 15904), not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear comparative result. The model has provided a step-by-step
        analysis and concluded with a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.

        of 73068, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        model concluded that "76244 is west of 73068, not east of it" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 76244, TX is east of 73068, OK. The model determined
        that 76244 is west of 73068, not east of it, and provided this as a direct
        comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states "14103 (western NY) is slightly
        west of 16651 (central PA)" which indicates a difference in position, not
        equality. The model is saying NO because 14103 is west of 16651, not because
        they are at the same longitude (though it notes they are "approximately at
        the same longitude" before specifying the difference).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 14103, NY is east of 16651, PA. The model provides
        a step-by-step analysis and concludes with a clear "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "14103 in western
        NY would be west of 16651 in central PA" - indicating a directional difference
        (west vs. east) between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "Based on this analysis,
        14103, NY would be located east of 16651, PA" and answers "NO". Then it reconsiders
        and concludes "After reconsidering the geography, 14103 in western NY would
        be west of 16651 in central PA" and answers "NO" again. The model's final
        answer is clearly "NO" to the question of whether 14103, NY is located east
        of 16651, PA.

        "primarily north of central Pennsylvania (16651), not directly east of it"
        and that "the predominant directional relationship is northern rather than
        eastern." The model acknowledges there "may have a slight eastward component"
        but concludes the relationship is predominantly northern, not eastern. This
        indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated as a standalone
        "NO" followed by an explanation of why the answer is no.

        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "32220 is slightly
        WEST of or approximately at the same longitude as 29829." The mention of "slightly
        WEST" indicates a difference in values, even if small, which is the reason
        for the NO answer. Even though it mentions they are "very close" and "approximately
        at the same longitude," it still identifies a directional difference (slightly
        west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 32220 FL is not located

        east of Toledo" (43607), indicating a difference in their east-west positions.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east rather than west),
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that 48509 is not west of 43607. The
        model explains that Flint, Michigan (48509) is "slightly northeast of Toledo,

        The model's "NO" answer appears to contradict its own reasoning, as it concludes
        that one location is east of the other but then answers "NO". However, I'm
        only evaluating what was stated, not resolving contradictions. Since the model
        clearly indicates a difference in position rather than equality, the answer
        is False.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 48509 is east of 43607. The model concludes that

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 48509, MI is not located
        east of 43607, OH. It's actually located to the northwest." This is an explicit

        is east of Harbor City (90710), indicating they are in different locations
        with Gardena being more inland and Harbor City being closer to the coast.
        The NO answer is given because the model determined that the premise in the
        question (that 90247 is east of 90710) is incorrect - not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model explicitly states "NO" after explaining that Gardena
        would be east of Harbor City, not west of it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 98349 is northwest
        of 97223, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The reason
        for the NO answer is that one location is northwest of the other, not that
        they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "98349 is NOT east of

        or the same. Instead, it concludes that "The Key Peninsula area (98349) is
        slightly west of the Portland area (97223)" which indicates a difference in
        position (one is west of the other). This difference in position is the reason
        for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 98349, WA is not located east of 97223, OR. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning suggesting that Western
        Kentucky (42086) is "generally north and slightly east of western Tennessee
        (38305)." The model is indicating a difference in position (with Kentucky
        being slightly east of Tennessee), not equality, as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative
        question about whether 38305, TN is east of 42086, KY.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in positions,
        stating that "Milford is positioned more to the west/southwest" and "New Boston
        is positioned more to the east/northeast relative to Milford." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "03057 (Milford) is

        is located to the east of Sorrento (32776), which indicates a difference in
        their positions. This contradicts the final "NO" answer, but as instructed,
        I'm not resolving this contradiction. The model did not give a NO answer because
        the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "48212 (Detroit/Hamtramck) is actually located
        to the southwest of 48316 (Macomb Township)" and "Macomb Township is positioned
        more to the east than Detroit/Hamtramck." The model is indicating a specific
        directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that suggests the locations
        are in different positions, with 78737 (TX) being further west than 73703
        (OK). The model explains this through several steps of reasoning about ZIP
        code patterns and the general geography of Texas and Oklahoma.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether 78737, TX is east of 73703, OK.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "78737 is west of
        73703, not east" and provides geographic reasoning that the two zip codes
        are in different positions (with 78737 being west of 73703). The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        In fact, it explicitly states that "78737 (Austin area) is slightly west of
        73703 (Enid area)" which indicates a difference in values, even if described
        as "slight". The model gives a directional difference as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 78737, TX is not
        located east of 73703, OK. It is actually slightly west." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Texas zip code is east of the Oklahoma zip code. The model
        explicitly concludes "Since 78737 (Austin area, TX) is west of 73703 (Enid,
        OK), the Texas zip code is NOT east of the Oklahoma zip code. NO"

        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "78737 (Austin area,
        TX) is slightly west of or approximately aligned with 73703 (Enid area, OK)".
        The mention of "slightly west" indicates a difference in position, not equality.
        Even though it also mentions "approximately aligned," the inclusion of "slightly
        west" means the model is noting a difference, not claiming the locations are
        exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 78737, TX is east of 73703, OK. The answer is clearly

        further east than 27299 (in North Carolina), indicating a difference in their
        east-west positioning. The model states "32962 (Vero Beach area) is on Florida's
        Atlantic coast, which is one of the easternmost parts of the state" and "27299
        is in central North Carolina, which is west of Florida's Atlantic coastline."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it concludes that "central Alabama (where 36054 is) is actually slightly
        east of south-central Kentucky (where 42122 is)" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.

        of 36054, AL," indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself, stating "42122, KY is actually west of 36054, AL." This is a clear
        NO answer to the question of whether 42122, KY is east of 36054, AL.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 42122 (KY) is located
        to the west or northwest of 36054 (AL), indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "42122, KY is located
        to the west (or northwest) of 36054, AL, not to the east" and provides a definitive
        "NO" as the last word of its response.

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer after further analysis. The
        model's final conclusion was that "Glasgow, KY (42122) is indeed east of Shorter,
        AL (36054)."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 53597 is west of 53705, indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. The reason for the NO
        answer is that one location is west of the other, not that they are in the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 53597, WI is not
        located east of 53705, WI. It is located west of it." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        that "53597 is generally considered to be slightly west of 53705, not east
        of it." The model is noting a directional difference (slightly west), not
        equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 53597, WI is not located east of 53705, WI. This

        west of most of Washington state, and 98580 being in western Washington would
        place it at a similar longitude or slightly east of Portland." This indicates
        a directional difference (Portland being west or 98580 being slightly east),
        not equality. The model is giving a NO answer based on directional positioning,
        not because the locations have identical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "65616, MO is east
        of 71964, AR" - indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model gives a NO answer because it believes one location is east of the
        other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also clearly states "71964, AR is NOT located east of 65616,
        MO" in its conclusion. This is a definitive negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        in the western part of north-central Texas. The model even stated "Brownsville
        is further east than Azle" before contradicting itself with the final NO answer.
        Since equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
