      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is\
        \ automatically False according to the criteria. The values were also not\
        \ equal (124.1\xB0W vs 124.2\xB0W)"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the longitudes and determining that Ocean Shores,
        WA is east of North Bend, OR

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal/same
        longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Ocean Shores is "slightly to
        the west" of North Bend, indicating a difference in position, even if small.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that Ocean Shores is actually slightly west of North
        Bend, not east as asked in the question.'

    15b6ece9-e21b-44e0-9a60-87bad4675ef6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both cities are on the
        coast, it doesn't state they are at exactly the same longitude or that equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it simply states they are both "near
        the western edge of their respective states" while making its comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO, 98569, WA is not located east of 97459, OR." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a difference,
        stating that Ocean Shores "is likely to be slightly more west" than Coos Bay.
        This directional difference, even though described as "slightly," means the
        NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Ocean Shores is "west of"
        North Bend, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the eastward position
        of the zip codes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or identical longitudes. Instead, it describes them as "relatively close"
        and "aligned longitudinally with minimal east-west deviation" but does not
        explicitly state they are the same. Since equality is not stated as the reason
        for the NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result, making this a definitive NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        that Ocean Shores is "more westerly than North Bend" and that North Bend is
        "slightly further inland." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the zip codes are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Apple
        Valley (92307) is east of San Diego (92108), indicating different locations.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that 92307 (Apple Valley) is east of 92108 (San Diego), not
        the other way around.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        locations are different (one is west of the other), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states "San Diego is generally situated west of Apple
        Valley" and concludes that "92108 is located west of 92307".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that 92108 is west of 92307 (not east as asked in the question).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Elmer was explicitly stated to be southwest of Mantua, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states "85745 is north and slightly west of 85746".
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a definitive comparative judgment about the relative
        positions of the zip codes.'

    a266ec8c-3d46-49c6-9127-957f56a750d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it indicates there are
        positional differences, noting that 85745 is "slightly to the north and possibly
        slightly east of 85746." The NO answer is based on relative positions, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 85745 is east of 85746, providing this as a direct
        comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    abbfc40c-cc51-4eb7-b815-d47085f3ad41:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the zip
        codes are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with 85745 being "north and slightly west" of 85746. Any directional
        difference, even if described as "slight," means we must classify this as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "the answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after determining that 85745 is not east of 85746 (it''s
        actually "north and slightly west")'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the ZIP codes are in the same location. The model explicitly states they are
        in different positions (one northeast of the other), and this directional
        difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        provides a clear comparative result, explaining that 85745 is not east of
        85746 (it's northeast instead).

        location is west of the other, not because the locations have equal coordinates.
        The model explicitly states "Oklahoma is generally west of Nebraska" and "Seminole,
        OK is west of Lincoln, NE" indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that 74868 (OK) is west of 68516

        the north and slightly to the east of ZIP code 85338" - noting a directional
        difference, even if slight. The NO answer is based on the fact that one is
        not directly east of the other, not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the zip codes are in the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        the model states that 85395 is "primarily north of 85338" - indicating a different
        relative position, not equality. The NO answer was based on directional difference
        (north vs east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, indicating that 85395 is not east of 85338. The
        model provides a clear comparative result based on directional analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the primary
        direction was north (with only a slight eastern component). The model explicitly
        notes a directional difference ("north and slightly east"), so this doesn't
        qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the directional relationship between
        the zip codes. While it adds nuance about the direction being "primarily north
        and somewhat east", it gives a definitive NO to the specific question about
        being east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (with Scarsdale being west of Jamaica),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions and determining that 10583 (Scarsdale)

        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates that Queens/Jamaica is east
        of Westchester/Scarsdale. The NO answer is given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and "10583, NY is
        not located east of 11439, NY" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Queens (11439) is east of Westchester County (10583). The NO
        answer is given because 10583 is west of 11439, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographic positions of the two zip codes. The answer
        directly addresses the comparative question of whether 10583 is east of 11439.

        location is west of the other ("Longview, TX (75601) is west of Henderson,
        TX (75652)"), not because the locations are at the same longitude. Since it
        identifies a directional difference, even if the actual difference might be
        small, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
