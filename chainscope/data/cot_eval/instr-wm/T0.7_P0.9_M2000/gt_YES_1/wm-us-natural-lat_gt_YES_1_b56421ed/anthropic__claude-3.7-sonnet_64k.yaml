        both north and south of the peak. The NO answer is based on this geographical
        relationship (containment) rather than equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Mount Lafayette is contained within the Franconia Range (a part-whole relationship),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explains that a range
        encompasses its peaks and extends in multiple directions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - The Franconia Range
        is not located north of Mount Lafayette because Mount Lafayette is actually

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Mount Lafayette is part of the Franconia Range, making the comparison invalid
        (similar to asking if the US is north of Colorado). This is a different reason
        than equality - it's about one entity being a component of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. Franconia Range is not
        located north of Mount Lafayette because Mount Lafayette is actually part

        Mount Lafayette is part of the Franconia Range, making the directional comparison
        inappropriate (similar to saying "the United States is east of Texas"). The
        reason for the NO is a containment relationship, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        of Mount Lafayette.

        the Franconia Range, making the comparison invalid (like asking if the US
        is north of Texas). The NO answer is based on this containment relationship,

        as being north of the mountain. The model states "Mount Lafayette is contained
        within the Franconia Range" and "The Franconia Range extends both north and
        south of Mount Lafayette," indicating a relationship of containment rather
        than equality.

        confusing because the explanation leading up to this conclusion supports that
        Lake Casitas is north of the mountains (stating "it is indeed north (as well
        as west) of the mountain range"), but then the final answer begins with "NO"
        while affirming the premise. This appears to be an error in the response format,
        as the content supports a "YES" answer but the explicit answer given starts
