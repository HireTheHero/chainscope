        described as small, any stated difference means this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        equal, but rather because one is a part of the other (Mount Lafayette is part
        of Franconia Range), making the comparison invalid. The model states "it doesn't
        make sense to say one is north of the other" because of this containment relationship,

        Mountains are west of the Animas Mountains, not north. The presence of any
        directional difference (west) means this is not an equality-based NO.

        While they are described as parallel and overlapping in latitude, the western
        position difference is clearly stated as the reason for the NO answer.

        a clear difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
