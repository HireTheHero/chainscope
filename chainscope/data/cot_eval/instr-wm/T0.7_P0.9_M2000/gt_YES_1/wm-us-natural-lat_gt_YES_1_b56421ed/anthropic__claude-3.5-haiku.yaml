      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions (southwestern vs northeastern Arizona)
        and explicitly states that Vulture Mountains are south of Luna Lake, not because
        the locations are at the same position. The NO is due to a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing
        Vulture Mountains are south of Luna Lake rather than north.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Vulture Mountains being south of Luna Lake), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Vulture Mountains
        are south of Luna Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Vulture Mountains are "significantly south of Luna Lake" - indicating
        a clear difference in position as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions of the
        locations (specifically that Vulture Mountains are NOT north of Luna Lake)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Vulture Mountains
        being south of Luna Lake, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in position ("significantly
        south of"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states "Vulture Mountains are south of Luna Lake" as a comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes they are in different positions
        (central vs eastern Arizona) and uses this difference as the basis for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the east-west positions
        of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Vulture Mountains
        are south of Luna Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Vulture Mountains are NOT located
        north of Luna Lake. The answer is explicit and definitive.

        location. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Lake Lahontan
        is actually south of Boca Reservoir"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Lake Lahontan is north of Boca Reservoir. The
        answer is explicit and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Lake Lahontan is further south and west compared to Boca Reservoir"
        and "Boca Reservoir is actually north of Lake Lahontan." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result, stating that "Lake Lahontan is NOT located
        north of Boca Reservoir." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (positions) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that East
        Okoboji Lake is SOUTH of West Okoboji Lake, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positioning of
        the lakes (stating that East Okoboji Lake is south of West Okoboji Lake, not
        north).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at equal
        latitude or the same position north-south. Instead, it explains that East
        Okoboji Lake is east of West Okoboji Lake, not north of it. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the lakes.

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that East
        Okoboji Lake is SOUTH of West Okoboji Lake, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        that East Okoboji Lake is south of West Okoboji Lake, not north.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same latitude or have equal north-south positions. Instead, it concludes NO
        because they are "more east-west oriented" rather than because they are at
        the same north-south position. The model's reasoning focuses on their east-west
        arrangement rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after going through its step-by-step reasoning about the lakes'
        relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the positions were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that
        East Okoboji Lake is east of West Okoboji Lake, indicating a different relative
        position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions of the
        lakes. The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for its NO answer - that East Okoboji Lake is east of West Okoboji Lake, not
        north of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether East Okoboji Lake is
        north of West Okoboji Lake.

        that the lakes are at the same location or have equal positions. Instead,
        it explicitly states they are in different positions (east and west of each
        other) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at equal
        positions - instead, it explicitly indicates they are in different positions
        (east vs west). The NO answer is based on directional difference (East Okoboji
        Lake being east/southeast of West Okoboji Lake, not north), not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at equal
        positions - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different positions,
        with West Okoboji Lake being west of East Okoboji Lake. The NO answer is based
        on their relative positioning, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about the lakes' relative positions.

        north of the Bridger Range," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        appears to be given because the stated premise was incorrect (the model found
        Lake Osakis to be north, not south, of the Bridger Range).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" and "NO,
        Lake Osakis, MN is NOT located north of the Bridger Range, MT." This is an

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Lake Tuendae
        being "slightly north of Soda Lake." Even though the difference is described
        as "slight," any directional difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Soda Lake is not
        located north of Lake Tuendae" and provides a clear comparative result, stating
        that Lake Tuendae is slightly north of Soda Lake.

        (Soda Lake being south of Lake Tuendae), not because the locations are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Mountain is southeast of Stoneman Lake, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        locations have different positions (one southeast, one southwest) and explicitly
        states that one is east of the other, not because they are equal or the same.
        The NO is due to finding a different directional relationship than what was

        NO answer is directly based on their equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        of any content about equality in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (I cannot confidently
        say it is north)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison rather
        than making a definitive comparative statement. This is effectively stating
        "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        Orange Lake is southeast of the Moosic Mountains, not because the locations
        are at the same position. It explicitly states a directional difference ("Orange
        Lake, NY is southeast of the Moosic Mountains").

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Orange Lake is east/southeast of the Moosic Mountains), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference, so even though the difference might be small, it's not claiming
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        positioning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states that Orange Lake is east/southeast of the
        Moosic Mountains and that the Moosic Mountains are actually north of Orange
        Lake. The NO is based on a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison directly.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Orange
        Lake was determined to be southeast of the Moosic Mountains, indicating a
        clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Orange Lake
        is southeast of the Moosic Mountains and therefore not north of them.

        Lake is southeast of the Moosic Mountains, not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly notes a directional difference ("Orange
        Lake, NY is southeast of the Moosic Mountains"), so this is not a case of
        equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality. It explicitly states that Imperial Reservoir is south of Lake
        Worth, indicating a clear difference in latitude. The model does not claim
        the locations are at the same latitude or equal in any way.

        the locations are at the same latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Imperial Reservoir is "significantly south of Lake Worth" - indicating a clear
        difference in position, not equality. The NO is based on Imperial Reservoir
        being south of, not equal to, Lake Worth.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Imperial Reservoir being south of Lake Worth), not because the locations
        are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with Imperial Reservoir being "south of Lake Worth, TX".

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Imperial Reservoir
        is south of Lake Worth, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO
        is based on the opposite of what was being asked (south instead of north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to the geographic comparison

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Cuddeback Lake is west/southwest of Lake Mojave, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, indicating that Cuddeback Lake is not north of
        Lake Mojave. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states Cuddeback Lake
        is west of Lake Mojave, indicating different positions. The NO was based on
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on comparing the geographic
        positions and concluding that Corpus Christi Bay is west of Lake Denton, not
        because the locations are at the same latitude. The model does not state or
        suggest the locations are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is the reason for the NO answer. The NO is based on one location being south
        of the other, not on them being at equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, concluding that "Corpus Christi Bay is NOT located

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with Corpus Christi Bay being "south and west
        of Lake Denton." The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions of both locations
        and determining that Corpus Christi Bay is "south and west of Lake Denton"
        rather than north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Puente Hills
        is SOUTH of Baldwin Hills, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it explicitly states they are "in completely
        different states" and that Pettit Lake is "significantly west and southwest
        of the Sandwich Range" - indicating a clear difference in position as the
        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Idaho is "west and somewhat north of New Hampshire" and concludes NO
        based on their relative positions being different. The NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it explained
        that the NO is due to the locations being "in completely different regions"
        and "very far apart." The reason for NO was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question. While it explained that the comparison
        isn't meaningful due to the locations being far apart, it still provided a
        clear NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability to determine.
