        east than Ontonagon County" and "Ontonagon County is significantly west of
        Pasquotank County," indicating a clear difference in their positions. The
        NO answer appears to be an error given the model's own reasoning, but the
        question is about whether the model claimed equality as the reason for its
        NO answer, which it did not.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Coke County is
        southeast of Sanpete County" and concludes that "'East' would mean directly
        east, which is not the case here." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (southeast vs. east), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Terrell County is southeast
        of Roseau County, not directly east. The model's reasoning is that Terrell
        County is in the southeast part of the US while Roseau County is in the northwest,
        making Terrell County southeast/southwest of Roseau County rather than directly
        east. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes "Therefore, Terrell County
        is NOT east of Roseau County" and ends with "NO" as a clear, definitive answer.

        of Roseau County" and "'East' would mean directly to the east, which is not
        the case here." The model is claiming that Terrell County is southeast (not

        of Van Zandt County, which appears contradictory but doesn't indicate equality.

        to be directional (that Neshoba County is west of Perquimans County, not that
        they are at the same location). There's actually a logical error in the model's
