        the reason for the NO answer. The model is rejecting the premise that a fictional
        character can have a birthdate that can be compared to a real person's birthdate,
        not claiming the birthdates are equal.

        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, followed by a clarification in parentheses that it cannot definitively
        answer the question based on available information. Since the model gives
        a clear "NO" as its comparative result, the answer is NO.
