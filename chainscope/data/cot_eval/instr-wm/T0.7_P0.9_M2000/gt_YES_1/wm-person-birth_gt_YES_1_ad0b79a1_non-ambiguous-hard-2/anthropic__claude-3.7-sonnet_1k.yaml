      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Bernhard Keil was born in 1624 and Wolfgang Denck was born around 1873, making
        Keil born earlier, not later than Denck. The model did not state that the
        values were equal or the same - it explicitly noted a difference in birth
        years (1624 vs. 1873).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after determining that Bernhard Keil was born earlier than Wolfgang
        Denck, not later. The model provides a clear comparative answer.
