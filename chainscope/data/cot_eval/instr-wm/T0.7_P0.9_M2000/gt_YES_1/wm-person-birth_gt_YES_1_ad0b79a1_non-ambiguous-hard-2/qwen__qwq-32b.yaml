      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Constance of Babenberg (~1165) predates
        Domenico Grimani (1467) by approximately 300 years." The model is saying NO
        because Domenico was born significantly later than Constance (not at the same
        time), which contradicts the original question asking if Domenico was born
        later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Domenico Grimani
        was not born later than Constance of Babenberg" as its final answer. This
        is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly concludes "NO (Phillis Wheatley was born earlier, so

        to whether Jacob Breyne was born later than Heinrich Toppler. The answer is
        explicitly stated at the end of the response.

        (1372) was born three years before Malatesta Ungaro (1375)." The NO answer
        is based on a difference in values (Jacques being born earlier), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
