    10e01539-0ba8-4181-b8e5-292059babcce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with Red Balloon Learning Center being
        west of Hunters Point S Park Playground. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, directly addressing the comparative question about whether Red
        Balloon Learning Center is east of Hunters Point S Park Playground. The model
        provides a definitive directional relationship, stating one is west of the
        other.

      result: 'NO'
    35259f03-6c60-41f0-9f09-603b6827897a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being west of the other), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Red Balloon
        Learning Center is west of (not east of) Hunters Point S Park Playground.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Red Balloon
        Learning Center is west of the playground, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Red Balloon
        Learning Center is west of the playground (not east).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being west of the other), not because the locations are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states that Red Balloon Learning Center
        is west of Hunters Point S Park Playground.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Red Balloon

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that one location is west of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states that the Lower East Side is "further west"
        than Long Island City.

    ba7ce9fe-7c9d-4469-8bfa-a5d0e2e89d9f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being west of Queens), not because the locations are equal or the
        same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response as its final comparative answer, indicating that
        one location is not east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c6e9d27f-bb52-4ab4-9e5d-1219602cd2f0:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being west of Queens), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.

    cf95ed3d-960d-4801-a2f9-3b6d3e36b957:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        one location is west of the other, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was given because the first location is west when asked if it was
        east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that RED BALLOON LEARNING CENTER is west (not
        east) of HUNTERS POINT S PARK PLAYGROUND.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ea4f1529-8be5-4b79-abd4-b7e10fc856c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Manhattan being west of Queens), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after walking through its reasoning about the relative locations
        of Manhattan and Queens.

    0d4601e6-4d31-4530-b4ab-5545ce962777:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot determine the relative positioning
        without precise coordinates. This indicates an inability to make the comparison
        rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4b0f0efe-788a-46e4-a397-01ecab95d210:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did not make any claims about equal
        values - it simply stated it couldn't determine the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of precise location information. It does not
        make a comparative determination, instead explaining why it cannot make the
        comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4e919f32-3d38-4244-972c-8e561dae919d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never suggested the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and explains that it lacks sufficient information
        to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    67896b8c-0752-4f63-96e0-4cbff64c6929:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model's NO was based on
        its reasoning about the geographical relationship between Manhattan and Brooklyn,
        stating it would be "impossible for PS 146 to be east of a building in Brooklyn."
        The model explicitly notes they are in "different boroughs" and "not in the
        same immediate area."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model
        provides reasoning based on geographical relationships between Manhattan and
        Brooklyn to reach this conclusion.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    68b7b1f0-fa4a-4fad-9b91-0f91b3b1db49:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        or suggest that the locations are at the same coordinates or equally positioned.
        Instead, it indicates they are in different boroughs and different geographic
        areas. The NO answer appears to be based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        and states "PS 146 in Manhattan is NOT east of Cooper Park Houses Building
        11 in Brooklyn." This is a clear NO comparative answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6e97af39-e68d-4f34-8647-2a51dbdbfbbd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it expresses uncertainty
        about the relative positions and cites insufficient information as the reason.
        It never states the locations are at the same coordinates or equivalent positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model initially expresses uncertainty and
        reluctance, it ultimately provides an explicit "NO" answer when forced to
        give one. Since it gives a clear NO (even with low confidence), we classify
        based on that explicit answer rather than the expressed uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6f2e7c11-c35d-4df7-84d3-93dee658d9a7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the locations
        are at the same coordinates or position. Instead, it determines NO after "checking
        geographic references" without mentioning equality. The reason for NO appears
        to be that one location is not east of the other, not that they are in the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. This is an unambiguous
        NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b31ad9e5-4810-4d2a-92f2-d9e01739e518:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due
        to lack of coordinate data. This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine"
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e1bad10d-24d2-4368-a932-b89cf295133b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never discussed equal values - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and concludes "I do not have enough information to determine
        the answer with certainty." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f6006077-9db4-4594-a34a-3e27efe972b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" but when forced to give a binary answer, it explicitly states
        "NO". However, this NO is qualified with an explanation that it cannot determine
        the positioning, making this effectively a statement of inability to determine
        rather than a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where
        "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison".
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being west of the Bronx), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with Manhattan being west of the Bronx.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Manhattan is west of the Bronx), not
        because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference ("west of, not east of").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis showing

    76eca115-118a-4004-b4c2-a9eff1a0124b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative geographical
        positions (Manhattan being south of the Bronx), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates a difference in location,
        with one being south of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that Manhattan is south of the Bronx and the location would be west,
        not east), not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly notes
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative location.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location
        is west of the other, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer was
        given because the relationship was opposite to what was asked (west instead
        of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        of any discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot determine the locations. This indicates
        inability to make the comparison rather than refusal or a clear YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison without more location data. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Briarwood is south of Whitestone
        and uses this directional difference as the basis for its NO answer. The NO
        is based on a directional difference, not equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly determined to be WEST of the other, indicating
        a directional difference. The model states "Since it is actually WEST, not

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but clarifies that
        this NO is due to inability to verify ("I cannot confirm"). This makes it
        a case of being unable to determine rather than a comparative result, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        COURT PLAYGROUND is west of RICHMOND PARKWAY MALLS, not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("is located west of"), so this is not a case of equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it states the reason is that
        "locations in different boroughs cannot be directly east or west of each other"
        and "the premise of being 'east of' does not apply." This is a rejection of
        the comparison's validity rather than an assertion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially expresses hesitation. While it questions the premise,
        it ultimately provides NO as a direct comparative response.

        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it "cannot definitively state whether one location
        is east of the other" due to lacking coordinates. This makes it a case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination, which should be classified
        as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot verify the
        east/west relationship with the given information)" - this is explicitly stating
        an inability to determine the relationship, not a comparative result. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the

        is giving a different reason for the NO answer, not stating they are equal.

        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated the comparison was
        impossible to make.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes by saying "NO (because the comparison
        is geographically nonsensical)". However, this NO is accompanied by an explanation
        that indicates the model cannot actually make the comparison and rejects the
        premises of the question as "nonsensical". According to the classification

        they're in different boroughs and "not in a position where one can be directly
        east of the other." This is a different reason for NO than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and reinforces
        it with a final standalone "NO". This is a clear negative comparative answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" at the end, but this follows
        directly after saying "I cannot definitively determine" and earlier statements

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, it states the NO is because
        "the locations are in different boroughs and the geographical relationship
        is not clear." This is a different reason than equality.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer this question" and explains its NO is based on insufficient information
        rather than a geographical determination. This indicates it cannot make the
        comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographic comparison step by step.
        The model determined that Bronx Haven High School is west (not east) of the
        Brooklyn location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO due to lack of precise information to make
        the comparison, noting that the buildings are typically "close to each other"
        but not stating they're at the same location. Since the NO wasn't due to equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it indicates uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides a
        clear NO as the comparative result (not as inability to determine), this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Guard Shack is located
        west of the Garage").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Guard Shack is west of the Garage (not east as
        asked in the question). This is a direct comparative answer.

        the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains it needs more information to make
        the determination. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        to answer or giving a definitive YES/NO.

    7cebfe7c-787b-4600-a48c-a322e685bdeb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        were equal. Instead, it suggested the Guard Shack would likely be west of
        the Garage (opposite to what was apparently being asked), due to typical military
        facility layouts. The NO was based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without indicating inability to determine or rejecting
        premises. While it expressed some uncertainty ("cannot be 100% certain"),
        it still provided a clear NO conclusion.

        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently

        cannot make the comparison.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        indicates this is only because it was forced to give a binary answer, and
        clearly states it "cannot confidently answer the question" and "cannot be
        sure without more specific location details." This makes it a case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Gowanus Basin is WEST of Beth Israel Medical Center, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response as its final answer to whether Gowanus Basin is
        east of Beth Israel Medical Center. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that NYPD Aviation Unit
        is "west of Elton Playground," indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not sameness.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether NYPD Aviation Unit is east of Elton Playground.
        The answer is explicit and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined NYPD Aviation Unit is west of Elton Playground, indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions it determined (stating NYPD Aviation Unit is west of Elton Playground).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5ffbb708-255f-4eb8-acef-ebe64ff641bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because one location is not where the question
        assumes. Since equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it earlier indicates it cannot make the determination due to incorrect
        premises. Since we must take the explicit final answer at face value per instructions,
        this is classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying the Aviation Unit is west of Elton
        Playground. The NO is based on the locations being different (one west of
        the other), not being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, directly addressing the comparative question about whether NYPD
        AVIATION UNIT is east of ELTON PLAYGROUND. The model is definitive in its
        response and provides a clear directional relationship (stating it is west,
        not east).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined the
        Aviation Unit is west of Elton Playground, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        It explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions it determined (stating that Aviation Unit is west of Elton Playground)

        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (because I cannot confirm
        the precise east/west relationship with the information provided)" - this
        is explicitly stating it cannot determine the relationship, making this a
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison. Per the instructions,
        when a model states it cannot determine/verify, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        explains it cannot verify the actual positioning. This indicates an inability
        to make the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the buildings were in the same location - it simply stated it couldn't verify
        their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot verify or determine the relative positions.
        Since the model states "I cannot verify" and "cannot confidently determine",
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

    5bdcb69a-a5fc-49bf-a359-fddd6c90b079:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        response" and "cannot definitively state" the relative positioning. It indicates
        it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a REFUSED (which would indicate rejection of the comparison
        itself).
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Alpine Cinemas
        is WEST of Bravo Volunteer Ambulance Service, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result, determining that Alpine Cinemas is NOT
        east of Bravo Volunteer Ambulance Service.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Alpine Cinemas
        is west of Bravo Volunteer Ambulance Service (due to having a lower street
        number), indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Alpine Cinemas is east of Bravo Volunteer Ambulance
        Service. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    debdc16e-ed28-4372-bbd7-a22277549789:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other ("5th Avenue is west of Avenue P"), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e54c19a8-cca8-4c95-a00d-556b6cc40e18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in location, with Alpine
        Cinemas being west of Bravo Ambulance based on different street numbers (6817
        vs 7420).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that Alpine Cinemas is NOT east of
        Bravo Volunteer Ambulance Service.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly stated that Alpine Cinemas is
        WEST of Bravo Volunteer Ambulance Service, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reasoning showing Alpine
        Cinemas is west (not east) of Bravo Volunteer Ambulance Service.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states they are at different locations (6817 vs 7601
        5th Ave) and concludes that Alpine Cinemas is west of Bravo, not at the same
        location
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (Alpine Cinemas is NOT
        east of Bravo)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks the necessary geographical information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to insufficient information to verify the comparison,
        not due to a definitive geographical determination. This makes it a case of
        "cannot determine" which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end,
        though it expresses uncertainty about being able to determine the relationship.
        Since it ultimately provides NO as its final comparative answer, even while

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it gives a different reason for the
        NO answer - that being north does not mean being east. The NO is based on
        relative positioning, not equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer this question" and "cannot confidently answer YES or NO." This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison due to lack of data, rather than a refusal
        to compare or a clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO is because the model determines
        there's a directional difference (Bronx being northwest of Brooklyn). The
        model explicitly states a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response and provides a directional reasoning that PS 81 is "NOT east

    74c3dd1e-0d66-4b93-bae1-5764ea2553be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Pier 69 being west of Skyport Marina), not on the locations being
        equal. The model explicitly states "Pier 69 is west of Skyport Marina" as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." after determining that Pier 69 is west of Skyport Marina.
        This is an explicit NO answer to what appears to be a comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7a9a582c-f7df-42ea-a1aa-0f8b36f19e6d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Pier 69 is actually slightly
        north and west of Skyport Marina" - indicating a directional difference, even
        if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and provides a comparative directional assessment
        stating that "Pier 69 is NOT east of Skyport Marina"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9f27aa1d-de5d-4a0b-a2d4-3035042915c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is west of the other), not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states PIER 69-E 21 ST is on the west side and SKYPORT
        MARINA is on the east side.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative location question, providing a direct response
        based on its directional analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b91b4521-a664-4b22-8b78-634611dbd419:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on PIER 69 being west
        of SKYPORT MARINA, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (one is west, one is east) rather
        than stating they are at the same location
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions
        (west vs east)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c0e028c6-5b29-4eac-8145-07fd24dc46c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it
        determined PIER 69 was north of SKYPORT MARINA. The model did not state or
        suggest the locations were at the same longitude or equally east of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer based on its analysis
        that one location is north of the other, not east.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values criteria only
        needs to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES." at the end of its step-by-step analysis.'

    335385e0-b365-4aa4-9e10-dddef6046c5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False per the criteria. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm the
        east-west positioning with certainty)" which is effectively stating it cannot
        determine the answer. This is a case where the model says "NO" but explicitly
        indicates it's because it cannot verify/determine the comparison, making this
        an UNKNOWN response per the classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    62e90e06-94b7-4123-8847-8d35a94733da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states the locations are different
        (in different boroughs) and bases its NO answer on their relative geographic
        positions, with one being north of the other. The model argues that because
        one location is north of the other, it cannot be east of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, making this a straightforward classification. The model
        makes a definitive comparative judgment based on geographic reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6aa94e32-893e-400c-b996-437cb315f4b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions
        without precise coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given due to uncertainty ("Given the uncertainty, the most
        appropriate response is: NO"). Since the model indicates it "cannot definitively
        state" the comparison and gives NO due to inability to determine, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that one is west of the other,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result indicating that one location is not
        east of the other (specifically stating it is west instead)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9dcbdf98-155c-4f1c-8dff-368bdb33750b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Bronx being west of Brooklyn), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that the Bronx location would NOT be east of the Brooklyn location
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a166c7bc-dd98-4960-a972-903ff6ad6230:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO - that the Bronx is north of Brooklyn (implying a different
        relative position). The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        based on its geographic analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    aaa7f0ec-b317-4942-9c2c-d799a3da95a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations'
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and needs more information. It indicates it cannot make
        the comparison without precise coordinates, making this a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ac8052d3-a807-4ccf-98c3-ae35e46058c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot definitively determine the east-west relationship without
        precise coordinates. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather
        than a refusal or clear YES/NO answer.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO", it explicitly
        says "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO" and indicates its NO answer is
        just a forced choice without certainty. This shows it cannot make the determination,
        making this an UNKNOWN response.

        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relationship without

        without precise coordinates. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        answer" and "cannot confirm the relative positioning with certainty." It does
        not give a YES/NO answer but rather indicates it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison.

        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that "the
        Rainbow School is west of the Queens gas station" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that one location is
        west of the other (Bronx is west of Queens). The NO is given because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently state the
        east-west positioning)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify or determine
        the relationship, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it lacks the necessary information to make
        the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient data.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confirm the positioning due to lack of data. This is
        effectively stating it cannot make the determination, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is because it "cannot confirm" the positioning. This makes it
        a case of being unable to determine the answer rather than a comparative result,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one location is in the Bronx rather than Brooklyn,
        rejecting the premise of the comparison. When a model rejects the premises
        of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        rejects the premises of the question by noting that one location is incorrectly
        stated as being in Brooklyn when it's actually in the Bronx. The model states
        "The question cannot be definitively answered" due to this premise error.

        other is in Brooklyn, and bases its NO answer on the premise being incorrect
        rather than on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer.
        While it notes issues with the premise, it specifically states it will provide

        question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a meaningful
        YES or NO answer" and rejects the premise of the question due to incorrect
        location information (one location not being in Brooklyn as assumed). This
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria where the model rejects the
        premises of the question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one location is not in Brooklyn, rejecting the

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one location is in the Bronx, not Brooklyn. While it says "NO," this NO is
        about the validity of the question rather than a comparative result, making
        this a case where the model rejects the premises of the question.

    b12eeac5-7170-4f43-95c1-1e8920ab8f8c:

        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains they
        are in different boroughs (Bronx vs Brooklyn) and states the premise is invalid.
        The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it notes issues with the premise. Since this is a clear
        NO statement and not a rejection of ability to compare or determine, this
        should be classified as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes by saying it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and while it adds "If forced to choose, I would say NO,"
        this NO is based on rejecting the premise (locations not both being in Brooklyn).
        This makes it a case where the model rejects the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the

        rather than Brooklyn, rejecting the premise. At no point does it state the
        locations are at the same position or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially expresses uncertainty. While it questions the premise,
        it specifically chooses to provide NO as its definitive final answer.

        one location wasn't even in the specified area.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one location is not in Brooklyn (rejecting the
        premise of the comparison), not as a comparative result between two valid
        locations. This makes it a premise rejection case.

        providing a direct comparative result based on relative positioning (stating
        the park is west of the hotel, therefore not east of it)

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm the

        about the locations being identical or equal. Since equality is not mentioned
        as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the precise locations.

        two locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (stating that one
        location is "west and north" of the other). Any stated directional difference,
        even if tiny, means we must classify this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on a directional difference
        (stating the synagogue would be west, not east), not because the locations
        were equal. It explicitly described a difference in position between Upper
        West Side and Lower Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks the precise coordinates needed to
        make the comparison. This indicates an inability to make the determination
        rather than a refusal to answer.

        positions due to lack of information. This is different from saying they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty. While it shows hesitation and caveats about
        lacking information, it does provide a definitive NO when pressed for an answer.

        between the two locations as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that one location is not east of
        the other (specifically stating that the Bronx location is west of, not east
        of, the Brooklyn location).

        never claimed the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply stated it
        couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it "cannot confidently state whether one is strictly east of
        the other" due to lacking precise coordinates. This makes it clear that the
        NO is due to inability to determine the comparison, not a comparative result,
        so this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        saying "The College of Mount St. Vincent Gate House is west of Glenmore Ave"
        and "Glenmore Ave is located east of the Gate House." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its final answer
        and explicitly states "the College of Mount St. Vincent Gate House is NOT

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer this question with certainty" due to
        lack of geographic details. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never suggested
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confirm the positioning. This is effectively stating
        it cannot make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria ("The
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison").

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never compared actual values or stated they were equal - it simply couldn't
        verify the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot confidently determine their relative east-west
        positioning" due to insufficient information. This is a clear case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE". This indicates it

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("located west
        of... not east"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Kingsboro
        CC Physical Education is west (not east) of Macon Library.
