      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated they were in different boroughs and explicitly
        reasoned that one location must be west of the other due to Manhattan being
        west of Brooklyn
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after providing its reasoning about the relative locations of Manhattan
        and Brooklyn

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference (one is west of the other). The NO is because the direction
        is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that PS
        146 ANN M SHORT is not east of COOPER PARK HOUSES BUILDING 11 (it's west of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the high school
        is "slightly WEST of Yankee Stadium" and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that the high school
        cannot be east of Yankee Stadium.

    4170a573-c29e-4fdb-9d11-56d117754a10:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (high school is west
        of Yankee Stadium, not east). Any directional difference, even if slight,
        means this is not an equality case.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis that
        the high school is west of Yankee Stadium, not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Yankee Stadium being east of the high school), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Yankee Stadium is east of the high school, so the high school cannot
        be east of Yankee Stadium. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location being west of the other), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a specific
        directional explanation that Ghana Wesley United Methodist Church is WEST
        of Bronx River Houses Building 8, not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    66d960a6-9f2e-4f68-abfe-9cd8edd41dfd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that one location is west of the other. The
        NO is based on a directional difference (west vs east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer about
        the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it gave NO because one location is on the west side while the
        other is on the east side, indicating a clear directional difference between
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

    6fc9681f-9d28-41ce-b5cc-8835aa9424e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west while the other is east - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The model explicitly states "Mikvah Mid Manhattan is actually
        WEST of Alternate Learning Center Thompkins Park" as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative result that Mikvah Mid
        Manhattan is west of (not east of) the other location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ba48de11-107d-4a25-8fac-789a44984c95:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is WEST of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the positions. The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer about the relative
        positions of the locations. The model states one location is west of the other,
        not east as asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (one location being west of the other), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The response explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that one location is "much further east" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Mikvah Mid Manhattan is west of (not east of) the other location. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated they were in different positions, with one being
        west of the other. The NO appears to be a direct response to some unstated
        comparison question (possibly "is location A east of location B?").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that one
        location is west of the other.

    9c0fdb9e-4d2d-4f5a-ad5c-1e4f55559def:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal east/west positions. Instead, it explains that the east/west relationship
        is less meaningful/relevant due to the north/south separation, but doesn't
        claim they are at the same east/west position. The NO answer is based on the
        primary relationship being NORTH, not on the locations being equally east/west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional explanation that the primary relationship
        is NORTH rather than east/west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it indicates that Howard Avenue is "approximately aligned with or
        even slightly east of" the Bronx location, suggesting a slight difference
        in position. Since it notes a potential difference (even if slight), this
        doesn't qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends its response with a clear "NO" as its
        comparative conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, indicating "the guard shack is positioned to
        the west of most fort facilities, including the garage."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that the guard

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines the Guard Shack
        is positioned before (west of) the Garage, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after its step-by-step reasoning.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states they are in different positions with the
        Guard Shack being west of the Garage. The NO is because their relative positions
        are opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - the Guard Shack is
        not east of the Garage" and provides a definitive comparative direction ("The
        Guard Shack would be west of the Garage")

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "the guard shack would be
        west of the garage," indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it concluded NO based
        on its reasoning that the guard shack would be positioned to the west of the
        garage due to typical military base layout and traffic flow.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions
        of the guard shack and garage.

        are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different positions, with
        the guard shack being west of the garage. The NO is based on the directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a specific directional explanation that the guard shack is west
        of the garage rather than east.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location is
        "clearly WEST" of the other, indicating a directional difference. The NO is
        based on the opposite direction being true, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, determining
        that St Margaret's is west (not east) of the Academy.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one west, one east), not because they
        are equal/same. The model explicitly states the church is WEST of the Academy,
        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the church is west of the Academy and therefore NOT
        east of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states one is in western Bronx
        and one is in eastern Bronx, and bases its NO answer on this difference in
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that the western location cannot be east of the eastern location.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because the locations
        were different (church in western Bronx, Academy in eastern Bronx). The model
        explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the church is in western Bronx while the Academy is
        in eastern Bronx, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that NYPD Aviation Unit is "further southeast" and Elton Playground
        is "more north and slightly west." The NO answer is based on these directional
        differences, not on equality.

        as the primary reason for its NO answer. The model explicitly states they
        "cannot be meaningfully described as being east or west of each other" because
        they are "in the same location." This is a clear case where the NO answer
        is based on the locations being exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, NO"
        as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model
        does not indicate uncertainty about making the determination, but rather definitively
        states they cannot be east/west of each other because they are in the same

        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE (insufficient
        information)" and explains it cannot determine the relative positions due
        to lack of specific location data. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        equal - it says they "share the same general location" and that it's "impossible
        to definitively state their relative positioning."
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying it cannot confirm the relative positioning and that they share the
        same location. This indicates inability to determine the comparison rather
        than a definitive comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is east of the other (indicating a difference in position). The
        NO appears to be because the premise of the comparison was incorrect in the
        opposite direction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be WEST of the other, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        part" and concludes it is "WEST of Bushwick United Methodist Church." The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative directional conclusion that FDNY RAC UNIT
        2 is not east of LIBERTAD URBAN FARM.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it gave NO because it determined one location was west of the
        other (specifically stating Brooklyn is west of the Bronx). Since it identified
        a directional difference, even if factually incorrect, this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after reasoning about the relative positions
        of Brooklyn and the Bronx.

        of the Bronx" and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, explaining that the Bronx location is east of
        the Brooklyn location (and thus Brooklyn is west of the Bronx).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after explaining why the Brooklyn location

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Alpine Cinemas being west of Bravo Ambulance, not east), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a
        difference in location (5th Ave vs 7th Ave).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Alpine Cinemas is west of Bravo Volunteer Ambulance

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it's because they have a specific directional difference
        (Alpine Cinemas is west of Bravo, not east). The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations based on their avenue numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same - rather, it gave NO because the park surrounds the complex and
        therefore cannot be described as being "east of" it. The model explicitly
        describes a spatial relationship where one contains the other.

        ("occupy the same location"), this is not given as the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the NO is because the park surrounds the complex and thus cannot
        be exclusively east of it. This indicates a spatial relationship rather than
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explained that the NO answer was due to a logical
        impossibility - one location being part of the other means it cannot be entirely
        east of it. This is a different reason than equality.

        the park encompasses the complex, extending in all directions, making it incorrect
        to say one is east of the other. The NO is based on this spatial relationship
        rather than equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "essentially at the
        same location," it also specifies that "the pier would be further east" and
        is "part of the marina complex." Since it indicates there is some positional
        difference (even if they're related structures), this doesn't qualify as stating
        they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, even though it later adds some clarifying details. The
        answer is not ambiguous or refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, saying one location was "slightly west and south"
        of the other. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated
        difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that PIER 69-E 21 ST is not east of SKYPORT
        MARINA, but rather is "slightly west and south of it".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference (Pier 69 is south of Skyport Marina). The NO
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Pier 69 is not east of Skyport
        Marina (instead stating it is south).

        fact that the locations are "essentially on the same east-west line" and "approximately
        the same east-west line." This equality in their east-west positioning is
        the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Bronx location being
        west of Brooklyn location), which contradicted whatever eastward comparison
        was being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly stated that one location was west of the other ("The
        Bronx is generally west of Brooklyn" and concluded that the River Ave location
        "would be WEST of any location in Brooklyn"). The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that the relative positions
        of the boroughs make it impossible for a Bronx location to be east of a Brooklyn
        location (stating "a location in the Bronx cannot be east of a location in
        Brooklyn").

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fd7724ad-507d-42a9-8ea0-97a0fe2ff3df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Queens lies further east and
        that USTA facility (in western Queens) is still east of Edenwald Houses. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Edenwald
        Houses Building 12 is NOT located east of USTA South Gate" as its final comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        same north-south axis" and have "similar east-west positioning," indicating
        they are approximately equal in their east-west position. This equality is
        presented as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - RANGEL HOUSES
        BUILDING 4 is not located east of BETHEL CHURCH OF CHRIST" as a clear comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Rangel
        Houses is west of Bethel Church, not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Bethel Church
        is actually further east than Rangel Houses Building 4").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Rangel Houses is west (not
        east) of Bethel Church.

        there is a directional difference (Holy Trinity is west of District 25 Pre-K).
        Any directional difference, even if small, means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains

        The NO answer was given because the relationship is in the opposite direction
        of what was asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating the Bronx is west of northern Queens), not on equality of positions.
        It explicitly describes different relative positions and concludes that one
        location would be west of the other, not that they are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support
        this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly stated that one location is west of the other (RAINBOW
        SCHOOL in the Bronx being west of the gas station in Queens). The NO appears
        to be answering whether the Bronx location is east of the Queens location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Bronx being west of Queens), not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states the school "must be west of the gas station, not east of it".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"

    6170effc-37a3-4e63-a6b1-d40bf63ce984:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly stated that the gas station must be east
        of the school, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, based on its geographic reasoning that the gas station
        must be east of the school, not the other way around.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    63509669-6cd2-4319-a9a2-e3efae2acdc7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (school being west while the gas station is east), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a definitive comparative judgment about the relative positions of the
        locations (determining that the school is west, not east, of the gas station).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Bronx being west of Queens/gas station), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying the
        school "must be west of" the gas station.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        explanation and as a final standalone answer. The model makes a definitive
        comparative directional statement that Rainbow School "must be west of" the
        gas station.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference (the school is west of the gas station). The
        NO was given because the premise (school being east of gas station) was determined
        to be false due to their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its geographical reasoning that
        the school must be west (not east) of the gas station.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that one location is west of the other. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a direct and explicit negative response
        based on its geographical analysis.

    9d94a6eb-51fd-44cf-98e7-ba4c100320a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it concluded NO because it determined one location was
        north and west of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the points.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after working through the geographic reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference ("It is west of it"). The NO is based on the school
        being west of the gas station, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Rainbow
        School for Child Development in the Bronx is not east of the gas station."
        This is a direct NO answer to a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer but not because the
        locations are equal - it explicitly states that Stuyvesant High School is
        WEST of Dyker Beach Park, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears
        to be rejecting some unstated original premise about their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the geographical positions, making a definitive comparative
        judgment about the relative positions of the two locations.

        is WEST of Dyker Beach Park, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Stuyvesant High School is west of Dyker Beach Park, making this a clear
        negative comparative answer.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, concluding
        that Stuyvesant High School is "west of" Dyker Beach Park. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions and concluding that Stuyvesant High
        School is west of Dyker Beach Park Ballfield 5.

        in fact, it explicitly states "Stuyvesant High School would actually be slightly
        WEST of Dyker Beach Park", indicating a difference in position. Even though
        the difference is described as "slight", any stated difference means this
        is not an equality-based NO.

        the same position or equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying Stuyvesant High School "is west of it."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO - Stuyvesant High School
        is NOT east of Dyker Beach Park Ballfield 5" and reaffirms "The answer is:

        equal in longitude. Instead, it indicates that Stuyvesant is "roughly in line
        with or slightly west of" Dyker Beach Park, suggesting a slight difference
        rather than exact equality. Since it notes a potential difference (even if
        slight), this does not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparison question.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying Stuyvesant High School is west of
        Dyker Beach Park. The NO answer was given because the direction is opposite
        to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct explanation that Stuyvesant High School is not east of Dyker
        Beach Park Ballfield 5, but rather west of it. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

        north-south alignment," it also adds "with Stuyvesant possibly being slightly
        west." This indicates a slight difference rather than exact equality, and
        the NO answer is based on this directional difference rather than pure equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Stuyvesant High School

    6774e948-2d29-4cdf-95ea-a85e032bcb46:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that "PS 75 is
        actually WEST of the NYC Children's Center" - indicating a directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - PS 75 MAYDA CORTIELLA
        is not located east of NEW YORK CITY CHILDRENS CENTER" as its final comparative
        conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a404be73-0218-46bc-a987-6a57ab4459ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (PS 75 being WEST of the Children's Center), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations and determining that PS 75 is west of
        the Children's Center.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d586ece3-2d81-420e-901d-92abe9079e55:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is not relevant
        since this wasn't a NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of the two facilities'

    1fb9f63f-fb96-465a-984d-1335396e490c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "part of the tube
        extends further east than the consulate's location" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a specific directional reasoning for why
        the Pakistan Consulate is not east of the Canarsie Tube.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    224fc74f-39b1-4f15-b220-25af01fa7b91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states a difference, noting that "The Canarsie Tube
        extends much further east than the Pakistan Consulate location." The NO answer
        is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    35329f0c-c5ed-47e7-b61f-be65fb50f0ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different positions, noting
        that the Canarsie Tube "extends much further east" than the Consulate's position
        "around Madison Avenue". The NO answer is based on this difference in positions,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (the Pakistan
        Consulate is not located east of the 14 Street/Canarsie Tube)" which is a
        clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    545ff747-e56f-42de-9fd3-09cae5815499:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explained that the L train tunnel extends both east
        and west of the consulate's position, making it impossible for the consulate
        to be east of the tunnel. The NO answer was based on relative positions, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is not east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8e000d97-1638-4197-88a3-5c9e364fba65:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it gave NO because it determined the Pakistan Consulate (near
        5th Ave) was actually west of part of the tunnel (which extends to the East
        River). The model identified a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after working through the relative positions
        of both locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8ed79fe0-191c-4b1c-8b18-8dbf20100675:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "at roughly the same
        distance from Fifth Avenue," this is not given as the primary reason for the
        NO answer. The model's conclusion that one is not east of the other implies
        a different spatial relationship rather than equality. The "roughly the same"
        phrasing also suggests approximate rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        following its step-by-step reasoning that concludes "the Pakistan Consulate
        is not east of the 14th Street/Canarsie Tube"
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f0d0fe34-4fae-4b23-9c6b-30c09b13549d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that one location (14 Street/Canarsie Tube at
        1st Ave) is "further east" than the other (Pakistan Consulate near 5th Ave).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east-west positions of the two locations, providing a
        direct comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states there is a directional difference
        ("slightly west"), not equality. Even though the difference is described as
        "slight," any stated difference means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that Luria Academy is slightly west of the Flower
        Garden Pavilion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states they are in different areas (central vs eastern
        Brooklyn) and concludes one is west of the other. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing directional reasoning about the relative positions of the
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being west of the other), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Passages Academy Belmont is west of Linden Houses Building
        2, not east of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        different (with Passages Academy Belmont being west of Linden Houses), not
        because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative locations, providing a direct comparative
        conclusion.

    5bb0565a-6938-479e-93d4-96dbd1ef7b8f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with Linden Houses being "further east" and Passages Academy
        being "west of it." The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including "The answer is: NO" as its final conclusion. It makes a clear
        comparative judgment about relative positions.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with one location being west of the other. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states that LINDEN HOUSES is east of PASSAGES ACADEMY,
        indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (LINDEN HOUSES is
        east of PASSAGES, not the other way around)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        with one location being west of the other. The NO appears to be in response
        to whether one location is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after providing reasoning about the relative locations
        of the two places.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly stated there is a directional difference, with
        one location being west of the other ("East New York is further east than
        Belmont" and "PASSAGES ACADEMY BELMONT is located WEST of LINDEN HOUSES BUILDING
        2")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that one location is not east
        of the other (in fact stating it is west)

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Pumpkin Patch
        Marsh is WEST of Cedar Grove Cemetery, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO was because the premise of the question (presumably asking if one was
        east of the other) was incorrect in the opposite direction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions and determining that Pumpkin Patch
        Marsh is west (not east) of Cedar Grove Cemetery.

        Grove Cemetery), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Clason Point Gardens is west of Urban Assembly School), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations based on their borough
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Clason Point
        Gardens Bldg 25 is not east of Urban Assembly School for Collaborative Healthcare."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (one location is west
        of the other). The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location
        is "west of" the other, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        was given because Kirby is west of Hotel Utica, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center is west of Hotel
        Utica, making this a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Kirby
        Forensic Center is west of Hotel Utica, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Kirby Forensic Center is NOT east
        of Hotel Utica. The answer is definitive and explicitly states a direction
        (that Kirby is west of Hotel Utica).
