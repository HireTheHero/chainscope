      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are on different sides of
        the East River and that one is west of the other. The NO answer is given because
        one location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        explaining that Red Balloon Learning Center is west of Hunters Point S Park
        Playground. This is a direct comparative answer to the question of whether
        one location is east of the other.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        explaining that Manhattan is west of Queens and therefore the Red Balloon
        Learning Center must be west of Hunters Point S Park Playground.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result based on geographical reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying that Red Balloon Learning Center
        is west of Hunters Point S Park Playground. The NO answer was given because
        of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that Red Balloon Learning
        Center is not located east of Hunters Point S Park Playground. The model gives
        a definitive directional assessment, stating that Red Balloon Learning Center
        is west of Hunters Point S Park Playground.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Red Balloon Learning Center being "further west" than Hunters Point S
        Park Playground. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Manhattan is
        west of Queens and therefore the Red Balloon Learning Center is "not east"
        of the playground. The answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that the Red Balloon Learning Center is not east
        of Hunters Point S Park Playground.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states one location is
        west of the other, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer was
        given because the first location is west (not east) of the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Red Balloon Learning Center is west (not east) of Hunters
        Point S Park Playground.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being west of Queens), not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states one location is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on directional reasoning (west
        vs east)

    f1d43938-4cb5-4da1-984c-dac0891f7f7b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Long Island City is still
        further east" and bases its NO answer on this directional difference, indicating
        that one location is more easterly than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the geographical analysis
        it performed, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-sentence while explaining the first step. No final YES/NO answer was provided,
        and the comparison was not completed.

    fba45ec8-bc8c-457b-968e-c8094e1e7d0a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference with one being
        west of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, explaining that PS 146 is west of COOPER PARK
        HOUSES, not equal to it in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, supported by its step-by-step reasoning that

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with
        Manhattan being west of Brooklyn.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison based on the relative positions
        of Manhattan and Brooklyn.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Manhattan
        is west of Brooklyn). The model concludes NO because the first location is
        west of the second, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result based on the relative positions of
        Manhattan and Brooklyn.

    1dca9ea8-3c0c-4e21-b771-962d27029897:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        that PS 146 is "to the west" of Cooper Park Houses, not because the locations
        are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (one is "slightly to the west" of the other), which automatically disqualifies
        this from being an equality-based NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion of its step-by-step analysis
        and as a final bolded statement. This NO is given as a direct comparative
        result (west vs east comparison).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with PS 146 being west of Cooper Park Houses
        Building 11.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

    ada61912-e1f0-41fc-ad2c-43fb14f094b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (one location was
        west of the other), which is the opposite of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparative analysis that PS 146 ANN M SHORT is
        west (not east) of Cooper Park Houses Building 11.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        they are in different positions, with PS 146 being west of Cooper Park Houses.
        The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that the Bronx (where Fordham is located) is west of Queens (where
        St. Joan of Arc is located). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Fordham
        University Rose Hill Gymnasium is west of St Joan of Arc, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that Fordham University
        Rose Hill Gymnasium is not located east of St Joan of Arc. The model also
        explicitly states it is located west of it.

        difference between the locations. The NO is based on this westward positioning,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion of its step-by-step analysis

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states that FDNY Rescue Collapse
        1 is west of Straus Houses Community Center, describing different locations
        (one being closer to the East River, the other being more central in Manhattan).
        The NO is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, FDNY Rescue
        Collapse 1, Manhattan is not located east of Straus Houses Community Center,
        Manhattan." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated one location was in
        a different borough entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it's rejecting the premise of the question because
        one location is not in Manhattan as specified. When a model rejects the premises
        of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        being equal - it explicitly states that FDNY Rescue Collapse 1 is west of
        Straus Houses Community Center, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific directional reasoning
        (that FDNY Rescue Collapse 1 is west of Straus Houses Community Center).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions (one on west side, one on east side of Manhattan) and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that FDNY Rescue Collapse 1 is west of Straus Houses Community Center, not
        because the locations are equal. It explicitly states a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that FDNY Rescue Collapse 1 is west of Straus Houses Community
        Center, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines FDNY Rescue
        Collapse 1 is in the Bronx (north of Manhattan) rather than east of the Straus
        Houses Community Center. The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it as a direct comparative conclusion based on its
        analysis of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it gives a NO answer
        because of their relative positions being different (with one being north
        of Manhattan and the other on the eastern edge). The model actually indicates
        they are in different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it concludes FDNY Rescue
        Collapse 1 is likely in central/northern Manhattan while Straus Houses is
        in southeastern Manhattan, indicating different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states the
        NO is because "the Bronx is west of Brooklyn" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional assessment based on the
        relative positions of the Bronx and Brooklyn.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b73c3963-f30a-453c-bc41-ed12cdd04062:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Bronx location
        is northwest of the Brooklyn location, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two points. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that BRONX HAVEN HIGH SCHOOL is not east of HOWARD
        AVENUE PARK PLACE BUILDING 7B. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        results in False for question 2, regardless of any discussion of equal values
        (which wasn't present in this response anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, the NYPD
        Aviation Unit in Brooklyn is located east of Elton Playground in Brooklyn."
        This is a clear, direct YES answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states the Aviation Unit
        is southwest of Elton Playground, indicating different positions
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional comparison (Aviation Unit is southwest of Elton
        Playground, therefore not east)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Floyd Bennett Field is southwest of East New York), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly identifies a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that NYPD Aviation Unit is southwest of Elton Playground), not on
        the locations being equal. The model explicitly notes a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" as its conclusion after comparing the locations, making this a definitive

    f7c98f7d-2420-4ecf-8064-bfcc25b98146:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying "Floyd Bennett Field (NYPD Aviation Unit) is southwest
        of East New York (Elton Playground)." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit bolding. The answer directly addresses the comparative question
        about relative positions, concluding that the NYPD Aviation Unit is not east
        of Elton Playground.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        with "(without specific location data, this is the most reasonable assumption)".
        This indicates the model cannot actually determine the relative positions,

    b4d0c418-ec29-4954-acb8-053da4b7c098:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equality of values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model initially hedges and says a "definitive
        YES or NO cannot be provided," it ultimately makes an assumption and concludes
        with a final bolded "YES" answer. The model chose to provide a specific answer
        rather than maintaining uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    cf5f76d2-e565-4f57-bc75-e121e2c01ac0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is due to inability to determine the relative positions ("based on the
        lack of specific information to confirm the relative positions"). This is
        effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a definitive NO comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d08ec0d4-2408-47b8-838c-db43564ff15f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it didn't have the location information
        to do so.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is UNKNOWN"
        because it cannot determine the relative positions without specific address/coordinate
        information. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the facilities "share
        the same address" and are "at the same location," and this equality is directly
        given as the reason for the NO answer ("because they are at the same location").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, providing a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are "within
        the same complex or very close," it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same location or have equal coordinates. The response suggests proximity
        but not exact equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" and reinforces this with "**Answer**: NO" at the end, making
        this a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it needs more information (specific addresses)
        to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "PS 16 is to the south and slightly east of Canal Street" and uses
        this difference as the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with one location being west of the other. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative directional result, stating that Castle Day
        Care is west of PS 16, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the criteria, regardless of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        before providing a final YES/NO conclusion. While it walks through a detailed
        analysis process, it never reaches or states a final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Castle Day
        Care is located to the northwest of PS 16, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("northwest"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, after determining that Castle Day Care is northwest of PS 16,

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that CASTLE DAY CARE CANAL ST is west of PS 16 JOHN J DRISCOLL, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about making the determination.
        The model provides a directional analysis and concludes definitively that
        one location is not east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that CASTLE DAY CARE is west of PS 16,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO is because one location is west
        of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion, explicitly
        answering whether CASTLE DAY CARE is east of PS 16, with a clear comparative

        the same position or equally east. Instead, it explains that while both are
        on the eastern side of Manhattan, PIER 69-E 21 ST is "slightly south" of SKYPORT
        MARINA. The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are on opposite
        sides of Manhattan (west vs east) and uses this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        River Ave is west of Fermi Playground, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship (west instead of
        east), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that River Ave is not east of Fermi Playground (it's
        west of it). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        the Bronx location is north of the Brooklyn location. The NO is based on relative
        positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final answer: NO" and provides

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined the Bronx location is northwest of the Brooklyn location,
        indicating a directional difference. The model never claimed the locations
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal positions. Instead, it explains that the NO is because the
        Bronx is primarily north of Brooklyn rather than east. The model indicates
        a directional difference (north-south) rather than equality as the reason
        for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear directional
        difference (3rd Ave being west of 5th Ave), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        location, with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        locations on Manhattan's street grid (3rd Ave vs 5th Ave)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "aligned along the
        same north-south line" and "neither is significantly east or west of the other,"
        it describes this as alignment rather than explicit equality. The language
        suggests positioning along a shared axis rather than stating they are at exactly
        the same longitude or explicitly equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one location is east
        of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    54ed8029-9f76-4f7d-bf7e-788e9f24bb72:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Rangel Houses Building 4 is west
        of Bethel Church of Christ, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO is because the premise (is A east of B) is false due to
        A being west of B.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Rangel Houses Building 4 is east of Bethel Church of Christ. The
        model provides a clear comparative analysis and concludes that Rangel Houses
        is west of Bethel Church.

    9214ec84-ae2e-4423-8cb7-f6d0f8ef3ce1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that they are in different positions,
        with Rangel Houses being in the western part and Bethel Church being in the
        eastern part of Harlem. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a clear comparative result that Rangel Houses Building
        4 is not east of Bethel Church of Christ.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rangel Houses Building 4 is
        west of Bethel Church of Christ, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Rangel Houses Building
        4, Manhattan is not located east of Bethel Church of Christ, Manhattan" as
        its final answer. The model provides a definitive comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Rangel Houses Building 4 is on W 135th St while Bethel Church
        of Christ is on W 132nd St, and concludes NO because Rangel Houses is west
        of (not equal to) Bethel Church.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" as its conclusion after comparing the locations, indicating that Rangel
        Houses Building 4 is not east of Bethel Church of Christ.'

    e01eccfe-21d8-4051-a370-7a59f8f15ba6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that Rangel Houses is on Amsterdam
        Avenue which is west of Madison Avenue where Bethel Church is located. The
        NO is not due to the locations being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Rangel Houses Building 4 is west
        of (not east of) Bethel Church of Christ.

      explanation_final_answer: The response walks through a detailed analysis but
        does not explicitly state a final YES/NO answer. While it concludes that "Kew
        Gardens Hills Library must be east of PS 47 Chris Galas," it never explicitly
        states "YES" or "NO" as the final answer.

        Kew Gardens Hills Library is northwest of PS 47 Chris Galas, not because the
        locations are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (northwest vs southeast), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Kew Gardens Hills Library
        is not located east of PS 47 Chris Galas" as its final answer, providing a
        direct comparative result.

        location is northeast of the other instead of directly east. The model identified
        a specific directional difference between the locations.

        (stating one location is north of the other), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with
        one location being in the northeastern part and the other in the southern
        part of Queens.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the QUEENSBORO CC
        MEDICAL ARTS BLDG is not located east of EAST ROCKAWAY INLET" as its final
        answer. This is a clear NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that The Bronx Mathematics
        Preparatory School is east of Millennium Art Academy High School, indicating
        a clear directional difference between their locations. The NO is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Millennium Art Academy
        High School, Bronx is not located east of The Bronx Mathematics Preparatory
        School, Bronx" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states there is a directional difference,
        specifically that the park is "slightly west" of the hotel. Even though the
        difference is described as "slight," any stated directional difference means
        the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive statement that the park is west of the hotel,
        not east.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        incomplete response did not make any claims about the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        before providing a final YES/NO conclusion about whether the park is east
        of the hotel. While it gathered location information, it never reached a comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying the park is "west of the Comfort Inn Hotel, not east." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Edward Byrne Park is west
        of the Comfort Inn Hotel JFK Airport, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that PS 41 CROCHERON
        is west of CAMBRIA HEIGHTS ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer was given because the direction was opposite to what
        was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east-west positions of the two schools and determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explains that the schools are in different positions
        (northeast vs southeast Queens) with PS 41 CROCHERON being north of CAMBRIA
        HEIGHTS ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL. The NO is based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, explaining that PS 41 CROCHERON is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (one school
        is northeast while the other is southeast). The NO is because the direction
        is different from what was asked (north rather than east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was based
        on a different directional relationship (north vs east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the directional relationship between

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Bayside is west of Cambria Heights" and that one location is
        "slightly west" compared to the other. Even though the difference is described
        as "slight," any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that PS 41 CROCHERON is not located east of CAMBRIA

        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("southwest of"), so
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Pumpkin Patch Marsh is not east of
        Cedar Grove Cemetery because it is southwest of it.

        claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location couldn't be verified.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO", it immediately clarifies
        that this is because the question is "unanswerable" and one location cannot
        be verified. This makes it a rejection of the premises rather than a comparative
        result, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that BLESSED SACRAMENT
        CHURCH is west of PINK HOUSES BUILDING 3 (due to the Bronx being west of Brooklyn).
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        It specifically states that Blessed Sacrament Church is west of Pink Houses
        Building 3, indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, noting that the Bronx location is "north and slightly west" of
        the Brooklyn location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one west, one east), not because they
        are equal/same. The model explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, explaining that Ansche Chesed Synagogue
        is west (not east) of the other location.

        or identical. Instead, it determines that Ansche Chesed Synagogue is on the
        Upper West Side while the other location is likely on the East Side or near
        Central Park, indicating different positions. The NO answer is based on this
        positional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that Ansche Chesed Synagogue is not east of the other location.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with the synagogue being west of the overpass.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Kirby being west of Hotel Utica), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Kirby Forensic Psychiatric
        Center is west (not east) of Hotel Utica.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        they are in different positions, with the Lincolnton Post Office being northwest
        of Pier 107 CVII. The NO answer is based on relative positions being different,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Lincolnton Post
        Office is not east of Pier 107 CVII" as its final answer. This is an explicit
        NO comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives a NO answer, but not because the\
        \ values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different longitude values\
        \ (73.9836\xB0W vs 73.9700\xB0W) and concludes NO because the post office\
        \ is west of the pier, not because they're at the same location."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on finding that the post office
        is west (not east) of the pier.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal. It explicitly states
        "LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE is not east of PIER 107 CVII; it is west of it" indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer that LINCOLNTON
        POST OFFICE is not east of PIER 107 CVII.'

    7bf683ce-49bf-4fc0-9ed7-bce65da9522b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - rather, the model explicitly states they are
        on opposite sides of Manhattan (west vs east) with the Lincolnton Post Office
        being west of Pier 107 CVII. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east-west positions of the two locations, determining
        that the Lincolnton Post Office is west of Pier 107 CVII, not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a752447b-80ba-42ba-a10d-d009debc5fd1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE is
        "slightly further west" than PIER 107 CVII due to its inland location. Since
        it identifies a directional difference (even if slight), this cannot be classified
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result addressing whether one location is
        east of the other. The model is confident in its answer and provides specific
        directional reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explains that they are
        different, with one being south of the other, and both being on the west side.
        The NO answer is based on their relative positions being different, not on
        them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the eastward positioning.
