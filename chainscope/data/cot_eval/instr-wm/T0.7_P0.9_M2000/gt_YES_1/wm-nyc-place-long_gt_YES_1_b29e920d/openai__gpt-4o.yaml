    099b746d-d6ff-4f27-b2a8-2feddbe76fdc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (west vs east), not because the locations are at the same position.
        It explicitly states that one location is west of the other, indicating a
        difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis that
        the Red Balloon Learning Center is west of (not east of) the playground.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    12faaa5a-cdca-460f-a810-d9efe09f8f32:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is
        west of the other ("Morningside Heights is on the west side of Manhattan and
        Long Island City is on the western edge of Queens, Morningside Heights...
        is indeed west of Long Island City"). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer about the relative
        positions of the two locations.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        It explicitly states that Manhattan is "west of Queens" and concludes the
        first location is "west of" the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Red Balloon Learning Center is west (not east) of Hunters
        Point South Park Playground.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is west of the other ("the Red Balloon Learning Center is west
        of Hunters Point South Park Playground").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Red Balloon Learning
        Center in Manhattan is not located east of Hunters Point South Park Playground
        in Queens" as its final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is west of the other), not because the locations have
        equal positions. The model explicitly states that Manhattan is "to the west
        of Queens" and concludes the Learning Center is "likely located west of" the
        park.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Red Balloon Learning Center is east of Hunters Point South
        Park, concluding it is west instead.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b780790f-a097-485a-b8f9-66fa7cc8ac5c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying Red
        Balloon Learning Center is "further to the west" and that "Manhattan is generally
        to the west of Queens." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cd0c29da-f0ab-4566-9ea6-284f89017482:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Manhattan is west of Queens, and uses this difference in location to justify
        its NO answer. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with "Answer: NO" at the end of its response. The model makes a definitive
        comparative directional statement that the Red Balloon Learning Center is
        not east of the park.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "virtually all of Manhattan, including the Upper
        West Side, is to the west of Long Island City" indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after explaining that Red Balloon Learning Center is west of Hunters Point
        South Park Playground. This is an explicit NO answer to whether the first

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other ("PS 146 Ann M. Short in Manhattan is west of Cooper Park Houses Building
        11 in Brooklyn"), indicating a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis of the locations.

      result: 'NO'
    2d36ebb9-7b31-45b4-a102-83297a353fbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other (PS 146 being west of Cooper Park Houses), not
        because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.'

    34f91dfd-44e0-49e0-9265-5ac91c29b4f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying PS 146 is "located to the west" of Cooper Park Houses. The NO is based
        on the opposite of what was asked (west instead of east), not because of equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" and provides a clear comparative result, indicating that PS 146
        Ann M. Short is not east of Cooper Park Houses Building 11, but rather is
        west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    40efa838-e0d6-4662-9e62-2f553b664966:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Manhattan lies to the west
        of Brooklyn and concludes that PS 146 is west of Cooper Park Houses. The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions of the two locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn
        and that PS 146 (even on Manhattan's eastern edge) is west of Cooper Park
        Houses, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, PS 146 Ann M Short in
        Manhattan is not located east of Cooper Park Houses Building 11 in Brooklyn"
        as its final comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states Beach Channel Park is west of where
        Mall Eighteen would be located. The model indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating Beach Channel Park is not east of Mall Eighteen
        (rather, it's to the west).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying Beach
        Channel Park "is located to the south and slightly to the east" relative to
        Mall Eighteen. Even though this indicates some eastern position, the presence
        of any stated difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of
        the two locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Beach
        Channel Park is west of Mall Eighteen, not because the locations are equal/same.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Beach Channel
        Park is situated to the southwest part of Queens" while Mall Eighteen is "more
        to the north-central area").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Beach Channel Park is
        not located east of Mall Eighteen" after determining that Beach Channel Park
        is west of Mall Eighteen. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Beach Channel
        Park is southwest of Mall Eighteen's presumed location, indicating a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a definitive comparative statement about the relative
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Beach Channel Park is "to
        the south and slightly west" compared to where Mall Eighteen is located. The
        NO answer is given because Beach Channel Park is west of Mall Eighteen, not
        because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" as its
        conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. This

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Beach Channel Park is west of Mall
        Eighteen, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Beach Channel Park is not located east of Mall
        Eighteen, but rather west of it.

        locations are different - specifically that St. Peter's is "west" and "further
        west" compared to Red Hook. The model does not state or suggest the locations
        are at the same longitude. The NO is because one location is west of the other,
        not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that St. Peter''s RC Church is west (not east) of Red

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations have equal longitude values. Instead, it indicated that
        W 205 St is "not east of Brooklyn" while being "northeast" overall, suggesting
        a different positioning rather than equality. The NO wasn't based on equal
        values but rather on the relative positioning being different than what was
        asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model makes a definitive
        statement about the relative positioning, stating that while the Bronx location
        is northeast of Brooklyn, it is not east of the Brooklyn location.

        for the NO answer - explaining that the primary directional relationship is
        north-south rather than east-west. The model actually indicates there may
        be slight east-west differences ("parts of the Bronx may extend slightly to
        the east of some parts of Brooklyn").

        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Flushing
        is "north and slightly east" and "northeast relative to Jamaica Bay." The
        NO is based on the fact that Flushing is not directly east, rather than any
        equality in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion about the relative positions of the two
        locations. The NO is not a refusal to answer or an indication of inability
        to determine.

        describing Flushing as being "north and slightly west" of Jamaica Bay National
        Wildlife Refuge. Any stated directional difference, even if described as "slight,"
        means we should classify this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (with FDNY being west of Straus Houses),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is on the west side and one is on the east side
        of Manhattan). The model does not state that the locations are equal or the
        same - in fact, it explicitly notes their different positions. Therefore,
        the NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that FDNY Rescue Collapse 1 is west
        of Straus Houses Community Center. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a difference in position, with FDNY Rescue Collapse 1 being west of Straus
        Houses Community Center. The NO answer was given because they found a specific
        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "FDNY Rescue Collapse 1 is not located east of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Berkeley Carroll
        School Lower School in Brooklyn is located west of the Bellevue South Park
        Basketball Court").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that
        Berkeley Carroll School is west (not east) of Bellevue South Park Basketball
        Court.

      result: 'NO'
    5844cfba-470f-4681-84cb-88d4fda53f5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal coordinates. Instead, it gives a directional explanation,
        indicating that Berkeley Carroll School is NOT east of Bellevue South Park
        Basketball Court due to their relative positions in Brooklyn and Manhattan.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on these considerations,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    678e961e-8eef-467d-85af-d2790cbd1b66:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Berkeley Carroll
        School Lower School is west of Bellevue South Park, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO appears to be answering whether the first location is
        east of the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after completing its step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of the
        two places.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Berkeley Carroll School is "southwest" of the basketball court), and this
        difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Berkeley Carroll School
        is southwest of the basketball court.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different longitude values
        (-73.9791 vs -73.9741) and concludes that Berkeley Carroll School is west
        of Bellevue South Park based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and provides a clear comparative result based on longitude values,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were
        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO" without coordinates or map details. It explains how to determine
        the answer but does not make a final determination, indicating it cannot make
        the comparison without more information.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a determination that the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out a framework for answering but did
        not provide a definitive YES/NO answer. It stated "if...the answer would be
        YES. Otherwise, it would be NO" and concluded that it could only provide a
        "speculative answer." Since no clear YES/NO determination was made, this counts
        as UNKNOWN.

        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        accurately answer the question with a simple YES or NO without further detailed
        geographic information." This indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a directional
        difference, saying Howard Houses is "west of" the MTA yard. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Howard Houses is southwest of the yard, indicating a
        directional difference. The model never suggests the locations are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing whether Howard Houses Building 10 is east of the MTA
        Metro-North BN Yard. The model provides a clear directional comparison, stating
        that Howard Houses is southwest of the yard.

        indicating that Brooklyn (where Howard Houses is located) is west of the Bronx
        (where the MTA yard is located). This directional difference is the reason
        for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with an explicit comparative conclusion that Howard Houses is not located
        east of the MTA Metro-North BN Yard.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn (and
        thus Marion Hopkinson Playground) is southwest of the Bronx and "generally
        west of Riverdale Country School Lower." This indicates a difference in location,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Marion Hopkinson

        difference (west vs east), not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that Gowanus Basin
        is west of the medical center (not east as asked in the question).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying "Gowanus Basin is located west of the
        East Village." Any directional difference, even if described as slight (which
        this wasn't), means we should classify as False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (southeast vs east), making this a comparison
        where the values differ. The NO is based on the southeast direction not matching
        the purely east direction being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its analysis that the Aviation Unit is southeast (not
        directly east) of Elton Playground.

        that the buildings are in the same location or have equal coordinates. In
        fact, it implies they are in different locations but just not in an east-west
        relationship. Since equality of position is not stated as the reason for the
        NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it earlier expressed some uncertainty about needing to
        check maps. Since it ultimately gave a clear NO answer without qualifying
        it as inability to determine, this counts as a NO final answer.

        the buildings were in the same location - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm the relative positions with certainty."
        This is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an
        UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Building
        7 is located to the west of Building 6, not because the buildings are in the
        same location. The model identifies a directional difference (west vs east),
        so this is not a case of equal values.

        model never claimed the buildings were in the same location - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative
        conclusion. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify
        the relationship, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equal positions. Instead, it indicates a directional
        difference, stating that the Rockefeller University IT Pavilion is "west of
        most of Brooklyn." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Rockefeller

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        the same position or coordinates. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on the
        reasoning that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn and Rockefeller University, despite
        being on Manhattan's east side, would still be west of locations in Brooklyn.
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.

        a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually indicated uncertainty about one location's
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" at the end, but this is qualified
        with uncertainty ("Without the exact current location... I can't definitively
        answer") and assumptions ("assuming EMS Division 3 HQ is..."). Since the model
        explicitly indicates it cannot make a definitive determination, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in longitude (-73.9337 vs -73.8955) and concludes that one location is west
        of the other. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        in different terminologies" and "not distinct separate entities in terms of
        location" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates the values (locations)
        are the same, and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model's reasoning was not about equal values but
        rather about the non-existence of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but does so because it rejects the premise that there are two separate locations
        to compare (stating "there is no separate entity known as the 'Olmsted-Beil
        Complex'"). When a model rejects the premises of the question, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        effectively stating they are the same location/overlapping rather than different
        locations. This equality is presented as the primary reason for the NO answer.

        state or suggest that the locations are equal/identical/the same. It simply
        states that one is not east of the other, without specifying if they are equal
        or if one is in a different direction. Since equality is not mentioned as
        the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Olmsted-Beil House
        Park is not located east of the Olmsted-Beil Complex." This is a clear NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or at the same position. Instead, it indicates that SKYPORT MARINA is on the
        FDR Drive (eastern edge) and concludes that PIER 69 is "unlikely" to be further
        east. The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO" to the comparative question, providing a clear negative response about
        whether one location is east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explains that SKYPORT MARINA is "as east as
        it gets" and PIER 69 "would not be further east," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on relative positions, not equality.

    8e39eaf0-83bf-4b09-aa45-b3c648197c31:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        east-west positions. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that one location is south of the other. While both locations are described
        as being on the east side of Manhattan, the model does not explicitly state
        they are at the same longitude or equally east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is **NO**" after determining that one location is south of the other
        rather than east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        exactly the same position or equally east. Instead, it explains that both
        are on the east side of Manhattan near the East River, but gives their relative
        positions (one being on 21st St and one on 23rd St). The NO answer is based
        on their proximity and layout, not because they are at the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a comparative result, making this a clear NO answer.'

    be06be52-4251-4f63-975d-61dd7d24039b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that PIER 69-E 21 ST is "slightly
        west of" SKYPORT MARINA. This difference in position, even though described
        as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        and explains that PIER 69-E 21 ST is positioned slightly west of SKYPORT MARINA,
        providing a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or identical in
        their east-west positioning. Instead, it suggests they are on the same side
        (East River) but describes them primarily in terms of their north-south relationship,
        with one being "slightly south" of the other. The NO answer appears to be
        based on their general geographical arrangement rather than them being in
        the same east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, PIER 69-E
        21 ST is not located east of SKYPORT MARINA 2430 FDR DRIVE." While it expresses
        some uncertainty about naming conventions, it provides a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are "near
        each other" and "both close to the East River," it does not explicitly state
        they are at exactly the same longitude or position. Rather, it says "neither
        is distinctly east of the other" which implies a more complex spatial relationship
        rather than exact equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this lack
        of distinct eastward positioning rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating "Therefore, the answer is: NO, PIER 69-E 21 ST,

        or identical in their east-west positioning. While it notes they are "roughly
        aligned in the east-west direction," it actually indicates a difference by
        stating one is "slightly south" of the other. The NO answer is based on their
        relative positions, not on them being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines RIVER AVE is likely
        west of FERMI PLAYGROUND, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Edenwald Houses is "positioned west of the USTA Tennis Center."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis.
        The answer is explicitly stated in bold at the end of the response.

        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "Edenwald Houses Building 12 in the Bronx is actually
        located to the west of the USTA South Gate in Queens." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.

        instead, it explicitly stated one location was west of the other ("Edenwald
        Houses Building 12 in the Bronx is located west of the USTA South Gate in
        Queens"). The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Edenwald Houses
        would be "west of most locations in Queens, including the USTA South Gate."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and explicitly
        concludes that "Edenwald Houses Building 12 in the Bronx is not located east
        of USTA South Gate in Queens." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it suggests they are in different locations but cannot
        determine the exact positions. The NO answer is based on a "likely" different
        positioning, not on them being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with an explicit "NO" statement
        about the relative position, despite earlier expressing uncertainty about
        exact locations. While there is uncertainty in the reasoning, the final answer
        is clearly stated as "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison or discussed equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        give a clear YES or NO without specific addresses or coordinates" and indicates
        it cannot determine the relative positions without additional information.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (Rangel Houses being west and north of
        Bethel Church), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        notes differences in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis of the relative
        positions showing Rangel Houses is west and north of Bethel Church.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are "aligned
        similarly in terms of their east-west positioning," it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal or identical in position. The NO answer is given
        because Rangel Houses is not east of the church, not because they are at exactly
        the same longitude or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that
        Rangel Houses Building 4 is not positioned east of Bethel Church of Christ).

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rangel Houses Building 4 is
        "further west" and "is indeed west of" Bethel Church of Christ, indicating
        a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Rangel Houses Building
        4 is not located east of Bethel Church of Christ" as its final answer. This
        is an explicit NO in response to a comparative question.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot provide a "definitive
        YES or NO without further specific information" and indicates it needs more
        data to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that Rangel Houses is west of Bethel
        Church. The model does not state or suggest the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Rather, it identifies a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that Rangel Houses Building 4 is west
        of Bethel Church of Christ. This is an explicit NO answer to a comparative
        question.

        or west of the other," indicating that their east-west positions are the same.
        This equality is explicitly given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Rangel Houses Building 4 is located east of Bethel Church of Christ.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        (-74.0137 vs -74.0124), it explicitly states there is a difference between
        them, noting that Stuyvesant High School is "slightly further west." The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        provides a clear comparative result based on longitudinal coordinates, where
        it determines Stuyvesant High School is slightly further west than Dyker Beach
        Park Ballfield 5.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that PS 75 Mayda Cortiella is
        located west of the NYC Children's Center. The NO answer is given because
        of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with one location being "to the north and slightly to the east"
        of the other. Any stated directional difference, even if described as "slight,"
        means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (that PS 75 is northeast,
        not east of the Children's Center)

        \ west than the other. The NO answer is based on this difference in values,\
        \ not on them being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" and provides a direct comparative result, explaining that
        PS 75 Mayda Cortiella is further west than the New York City Children's Center.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions, with PS 75 being "west of" the Children's
        Center. It does not state the locations are equal/same/identical - rather
        it explicitly notes a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that PS 75 is located west of the Children's Center,
        directly answering the question about whether PS 75 is east of the Children's

    b8f635fe-9a94-46f5-bac7-fed4fbdba37d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (PS 75 is west of the Children's Center),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that PS 75 is west (not east) of the Children's Center.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found PS 75
        is west of the Children's Center, not because the locations are equal. In
        fact, it explicitly states there is a positional difference between the two
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        determining that PS 75 is actually located west (not east) of the NYC Children''s

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is west of the other,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the two points. The NO is
        because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, explaining that PS 75 Mayda Cortiella
        is not east of the Children's Center, but rather west of it.

        difference (northwest vs east), not because the locations were equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is **NO**" after determining that PS 75 Mayda Cortiella is northwest of the
        NYC Children's Center, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        the model determined the building was in a different direction (north/northeast)
        relative to the inlet.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional assessment that the building is
        not east of the inlet, but rather north/northeast.

        they are in the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations,
        where it concludes that the park is west of the hotel (opposite to what was
        asked in the question about being east).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the park is "west of the Comfort
        Inn Hotel JFK Airport," indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Police Officer Edward Byrne Park is not located
        east of the Comfort Inn Hotel JFK Airport." This is a direct comparative answer
        to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is west of the other), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states "South Jamaica is west
        of the JFK Airport area."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Police Officer Edward
        Byrne Park is not located east of Comfort Inn Hotel JFK Airport" as its final

        is located west of the Comfort Inn Hotel JFK Airport" as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Police Officer Edward Byrne Park is west of the Comfort
        Inn Hotel JFK Airport, providing a direct comparative answer to whether the
        park is east of the hotel.

        the park as being "north-northwest of JFK Airport" while the hotel is "to
        the south-southeast of the park". The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The
        NO answer is based on an "educated guess" about "typical positions," not because
        the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in the reasoning. Since it
        provides a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine), this should be
        classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        or suggest that the locations have equal coordinates or are in the same location.
        The model simply stated its conclusion without specifying whether the locations
        are equal or if one is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, the Church
        of Pentecost on Merrick Blvd is not located east of Laugh & Learn Academy
        in Queens." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were the
        reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer the question" without specific addresses. It explains what would make

        specific addresses.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer the question" and "cannot give a definitive YES or NO without further

        other ("the Church of Pentecost on Merrick Blvd is located west of Laugh &
        Learn Academy"), indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, the
        Church of Pentecost on Merrick Blvd is not located east of Laugh & Learn Academy."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other ("it is located to the west"). The model used address numbers to determine
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "the Church of Pentecost on Merrick Blvd is not

        model never claimed the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions without more information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it explains that it cannot determine the relative positions without
        specific addresses, and states that the answer "depends on their exact addresses
        and positions." It then suggests that with specific addresses, one could determine
        if the answer would be YES or NO.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Blessed Sacrament
        Church is "to the north and slightly east" of Pink Houses Building 3, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO appears to be given because the premise of
        the question (asking if one is east of the other) doesn't match the actual

        difference (stating that Blessed Sacrament Church is west of Pink Houses),
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates
        there is a difference in position, with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the geographical positions of the two

        While it mentions they are "on the same longitude range," this is not given
        as the reason for the NO answer - the western position is.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**" as
        its final conclusion after analyzing the locations, indicating that Blessed

        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one location's position at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot determine the relative
        positions without decoding the second location)". Since this NO is qualified
        with an inability to determine/verify the comparison, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than a comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's impossible to provide
        a YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relationship due
        to insufficient information about one of the locations. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it concluded NO because
        it determined Ansche Chesed was west of the assumed location (Central Park),
        indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ansche Chesed Synagogue
        is not located east of the given location" as its final conclusion. While
        the model acknowledges some uncertainty about the exact location of "TRNVS
        1WB OV PD PTH OPP 66," it still provides a definitive NO answer based on its
        assumptions about the locations.

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't decode one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information to decode one of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the
        location of one of the points.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot determine the relative
        position based on the given information)". Since this is explicitly stating
        an inability to determine/verify the comparison, rather than a comparative
        result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated one location couldn't be identified at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, because the location of 'TRNVS
        1WB OV PD PTH OPP 66' is not identifiable, making it impossible to determine
        the relative position." Since this NO is about the ability to determine/verify
        rather than a comparative result, and the model rejects the premise by saying
        one location is not identifiable, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    d3d42544-6c25-470d-b032-63ca12b5e0ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty about one location,
        it did not base its NO answer on the locations being equal. Instead, it explicitly
        stated that Ansche Chesed Synagogue is "west of" the reference point, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear directional comparison based on its assumptions about the locations,
        even though one location was unclear. Since it provided a definitive comparative
        answer rather than refusing or indicating it couldn't determine, this counts
        as a NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's impossible to provide
        a YES or NO answer without more information" and indicates it cannot determine
        the relative positions due to one location being encoded/unclear. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification as the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        make any claims about the locations being equal or having the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided steps to determine the answer but
        explicitly stated it couldn't make the comparison without coordinates or a
        detailed map. It did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer, instead suggesting
        that "you can conclude with a YES or NO" based on information you would need

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Based on this
        reasoning, the answer is: **YES**" after analyzing the locations'

    e94c4e5a-7d1e-402e-98ea-93f7c2f752be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that one location
        is west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration doesn't apply
        here.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, even though it expressed uncertainty about one of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "the answer is likely YES," it
        heavily qualifies this with uncertainty, noting that locations can't be verified
        and making assumptions. The response questions the existence/naming of both
        locations and explicitly states it's "challenging to give a definitive answer."
        This indicates inability to make a clear determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
