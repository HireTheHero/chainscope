    04a51bf4-c25c-41e4-869f-e82d8c582abf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other ("The Red Balloon Learning Center in Manhattan is west of Hunters Point
        S Park Playground"). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that the learning center is not east of the playground.
        The model provides a definitive comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    076564b9-f213-4095-87fa-2d0a50afa86d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that Manhattan (where the learning center is) is west of Queens
        (where the playground is). This directional difference is the reason given
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that the Red Balloon Learning
        Center is not east of Hunters Point S Park Playground. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0cf8764e-ea98-4536-8009-1f5c19cdd9ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being west of Queens), not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states that one location is west of the other, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides clear comparative reasoning about why the Manhattan location
        must be west (not east) of the Queens location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2b6f010b-4d7b-4bcf-9000-f28f31d7cfa8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not base its NO answer on the locations\
        \ being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Manhattan\
        \ is west of Queens and the Manhattan location would be west of the Queens\
        \ location. It provides specific longitude comparisons showing different values\
        \ (e.g., Manhattan at 73.97\xB0W vs Queens at 73.94\xB0W) to support its conclusion."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that the Manhattan
        location is west of, not east of, the Queens location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4a087ba0-e4f6-4778-ae5c-e5e326d7bec9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Manhattan is west of Queens
        and that the Manhattan location must be west of the Queens location. The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference (west vs east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about geographical positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4bfd7e97-7448-470c-9286-41055546ab07:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Queens lies east
        of Manhattan and therefore the Manhattan location is "inherently west" of
        the Queens location - indicating a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result based on the geographical
        relationship between Manhattan and Queens.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9ef0016c-0b50-4232-b566-bd7628ffcfb1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that Manhattan (where one location is) lies west of Queens (where the other
        location is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a comparative directional
        explanation (Manhattan being west of Queens). This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a4906b84-f296-4551-a4e5-5be8866c0ad2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that the Learning Center is
        WEST of the playground, indicating a clear directional difference. The model
        specifically explains that "Manhattan lies entirely west of Queens" and that
        "the Red Balloon Learning Center in Manhattan would be west of Hunters Point
        S Park Playground in Queens."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that the Learning Center is west of the playground, not
        east. This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b178a13c-a5b8-44b3-9619-7aacea246aae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because\
        \ the locations have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states there\
        \ is a difference in longitude (73.9923\xB0W vs 73.9583\xB0W) and concludes\
        \ that one location is west of the other. The NO answer was given because\
        \ Red Balloon is west of (not east of) Hunters Point."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear explanation that Red Balloon Learning Center is west of (not east
        of) Hunters Point S Park Playground, based on comparing their longitudes (-73.9923
        vs -73.9583).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b7c46311-9fe6-43c2-9afe-d12e26564c6a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Manhattan is west of Queens). The model explains that one location is definitively
        west of the other, separated by the East River.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that the Manhattan location must
        be west (not east) of the Queens location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    0a1862b5-fe79-451f-bd62-3b0d745efbf7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because PS 146 is at longitude
        -73.9395 while Cooper Park is at -73.9343, explicitly stating these are different
        values with Cooper Park being east of PS 146. The NO is not due to equal values,
        but due to a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a specific comparative explanation based on longitude values,
        confirming that PS 146 is west of (not east of) Cooper Park Houses.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    10d055f1-8c15-4df8-9fef-8857f87aa36c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific longitude values
        (-73.9503 vs -73.935), it explicitly states there is a difference between
        these values, with Cooper Park being more east (less negative longitude).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result about the relative
        positions of the two locations. The answer is supported with detailed geographical
        reasoning and approximate longitude coordinates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    11c77354-be06-4f2a-95d7-5ca025c7b4a7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear explanation supporting this answer, including specific coordinates
        and reasoning for why PS 146 is east of Cooper Park Houses Building 11.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2d87c372-b6dc-4a87-8687-84bd04892a83:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are at equal/same
        positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn has higher longitude
        values (-73.94 to -73.85) than Manhattan (-74.00 to -73.95), indicating a
        difference in position with Brooklyn being east of Manhattan. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that PS 146 in Manhattan is west of Cooper Park Houses
        in Brooklyn, not east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    442332cc-9be3-4024-b81f-95c8aba55178:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion
        that PS 146 is east of Cooper Park Houses Building 11 based on their longitudes.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8f3e3515-4866-4605-b5ee-8eb175c32ee7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different longitude values (-73.95 vs -73.93) and explains that Cooper Park
        is further east than PS 146. The NO is based on this difference in values,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that PS 146 is west of Cooper Park Houses, not east.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        \ explicitly stated to be west of Cooper Park Houses, with different longitude\
        \ values provided (-73.9654\xB0 vs -73.9419\xB0). The NO answer is based on\
        \ this directional difference, not because the values are equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by detailed reasoning about relative positions and
        coordinates showing PS 146 is west (not east) of Cooper Park Houses.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        specific longitude coordinates to support its answer that PS 146 is east of
        Cooper Park Houses Building 11.

    b07f5c8e-f608-4fb8-9207-b57f541fa21f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific coordinates (-73.947
        vs -73.943), it explicitly states there is a difference between them, with
        Cooper Park being more east (less west) than PS 146. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation that PS 146 is west of Cooper Park
        Houses Building 11, not east of it. The model provides specific coordinates
        and reaches a definitive comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives precise coordinates for both
        locations (-73.9415 vs -73.9262), it explicitly states there is a difference
        between them, with the high school being west of the stadium. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the longitudes of both

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Midwood (where
        the school is) lies southwest of Brownsville (where the post office is), and
        specifically notes that the school is west of the post office. The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a directional explanation that the school is west
        of the post office. The answer is a direct comparative result, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Carver Houses is west of Queensbridge Park Comfort Station, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the two locations. The NO is based
        on Manhattan being west of Queens, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and reinforces this with a detailed explanation of why Carver
        Houses (in Manhattan) must be west of, not east of, the Queensbridge Park
        Comfort Station (in Queens).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that Carver Houses is west of Queensbridge Park Comfort Station because
        Manhattan is west of Queens. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Carver Houses Building 8 lies west of Queensbridge Park Comfort Station,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on the fact that one
        location is west of the other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Carver Houses Building
        8 is not east of Queensbridge Park Comfort Station. The model provides a definitive
        comparative directional result (stating it lies west instead).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that Carver Houses is west of Queensbridge
        Park Comfort Station, with the East River between them. The NO is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Carver Houses
        Building 8 is not east of Queensbridge Park Comfort Station. The model provides
        geographic reasoning to support this answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive conclusion. The model considers multiple possibilities for Mall
        Eighteen's location and different scenarios where Beach Channel Park could
        be either east or west, but doesn't commit to a final YES or NO answer. The

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response consists entirely of thinking
        through the locations and street numbering system, but never reaches a final
        comparative conclusion about whether one location is east of the other. The
        response ends mid-thought about avenue ordering without making a YES/NO determination.

        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. The model spends a lot of time analyzing the locations
        and addresses but never reaches a definitive comparative answer about whether
        one location is east of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Kips Bay
        Towers (at Second/Third Avenues) is west of Stuyvesant Town (at Avenue C).
        The model describes a clear directional difference between the locations as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation of why Kips Bay Towers South Building
        is west (not east) of the Stuyvesant Town addresses.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows an extensive thought process trying
        to determine the locations of both buildings, but never reaches a conclusion
        or provides a YES/NO answer about whether one is east of the other. The response
        ends mid-thought while still trying to figure out where Kips Bay is located.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Kips Bay Towers South Building lies west of Stuyvesant Town's location,
        indicating a clear directional difference. The model specifically notes that
        Avenue C (where Stuyvesant Town is) is "significantly farther east" than First
        or Second Avenue (where Kips Bay Towers is).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including a final bolded "Answer: NO". The model provides a definitive
        comparative answer that Kips Bay Towers South Building is not east of the

        a difference between these values and uses this difference to conclude that
        Fordham is west of St. Joan of Arc. The NO answer is based on Fordham being
        west, not on the locations being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        playground is west of the parkway malls (specifically stating "the playground
        is west of the mall"), not because the locations are equal or the same. It
        clearly indicates a directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative directional conclusion that the playground
        is west of the parkway malls, not east of them.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states that Harlem would be west of any point in Brooklyn,
        indicating a clear directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that Harlem (in Manhattan)
        is west of the Brooklyn location, not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Manhattan (where Harlem is) is west of Brooklyn (where St. Andrews is), indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        with reasoning about why Harlem Teams for Self Help cannot be east of St.
        Andrews Playground Basketball Court, providing a clear comparative directional
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on Harlem
        being west of Brooklyn, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional conclusion that Harlem Teams for Self Help is west
        of (not east of) St. Andrews Playground Basketball Court.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that Manhattan (where Harlem is) is west of Brooklyn (where St.
        Andrews is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result based on geographical
        reasoning about Manhattan being west of Brooklyn.

    bc2858c4-fd9f-40b0-b5f9-a48a3e172dfb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that Harlem is WEST of St. Andrews Playground, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on one location being
        west of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship (whether one location is east of the other). The model is confident
        in this answer and provides directional reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Manhattan (where Harlem
        is) is west of Brooklyn (where St. Andrews is), indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on one location being west of the other,
        not on them being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly concludes
        that Harlem Teams for Self Help is not east of St. Andrews Playground Basketball
        Court, providing a definitive comparative directional answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Harlem being
        west of St. Andrews Playground.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer and reinforces this with an explanation about why Harlem (in
        Manhattan) must be west, not east, of the Brooklyn location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        it determined that one location is explicitly west of the other (different
        positions). The model states "Harlem Teams for Self Help would be west, not
        east, of the basketball court in Brooklyn."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Harlem Teams (in
        Manhattan) is west of, not east of, St. Andrews Playground (in Brooklyn).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that Harlem is west of the Brooklyn location. The model explains
        this is because Manhattan is west of Brooklyn across the East River.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that Harlem (in Manhattan)
        is west of the Brooklyn location, not east as asked in the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with the Harlem location being west of St. Andrews Playground
        due to Manhattan being west of Brooklyn across the East River.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative directional assessment based
        on the relative positions of Manhattan and Brooklyn.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that High Rock Park is west of the
        treatment plant, not that they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        describes different positions (one inland/central, one on eastern shore) and
        uses this directional difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative assessment that High Rock Park
        Building A is west of (not east of) the treatment plant.

        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that High Rock Park is west/northwest of the treatment plant, indicating a
        clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that High Rock Park Building A is not east of the treatment plant.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model consistently reasoned
        that one location was west of the other, exploring various possible locations
        and consistently concluding that the Mikvah would be west of the Learning
        Center. The NO was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-analysis, but
        throughout the lengthy reasoning process, it repeatedly concluded "NO" as
        the answer, stating multiple times that the Mikvah would be west of the Learning
        Center. The final definitive statement before the cut-off was "Therefore,
        the answer is NO." Despite the response being cut off, there were enough clear
        "NO" conclusions to classify this as a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with the learning center being "farther east" than the mikvah (due to Avenue
        A being east of 1st Avenue where the mikvah is located).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation that MIKVAH MID MANHATTAN is west

        explicitly stating that the Mikvah is west of the Learning Center. The model
        does not claim the locations are equal or the same - it specifically identifies
        that one location is west of the other. The NO is because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that the Mikvah is not east of the Learning Center (it's
        west). This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.

        or identical. Instead, it explicitly describes that one location (Thompkins
        Square Park at Avenue A/B) is "significantly farther east" than the other
        location (Mikvah in Midtown). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, MIKVAH MID MANHATTAN
        is not east of ALTERNATE LEARNING CENTER THOMPKINS PARK" as its final conclusion
        after detailed analysis. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the mikvah would be WEST of the learning center, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is based on the mikvah being west
        of (different from) the learning center's position, not because they are at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result about the relative
        positions of the two locations. The answer is supported by detailed reasoning
        about Manhattan's street layout and concludes with a clear statement that
        the mikvah is not east of the learning center.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - it
        explicitly notes a difference in longitude values (-73.9800 vs -73.9783) and
        describes the school as being "slightly west" of the court. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific longitude coordinates to support its conclusion
        that the school is west of the court, not east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        \ - it explicitly states that one longitude (-73.982\xB0W) is different from\
        \ and west of the other longitude (-73.977\xB0W). The NO answer is based on\
        \ this difference in values, not on them being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive
        comparative answer based on specific longitude coordinates, explaining that
        the school is west of the basketball court. The answer is explicitly stated
        both in the one-word response and the detailed explanation.

    c604d66e-a73d-4dc5-bcf8-e0ba863f0f7b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different longitude values
        (-73.9810 vs -73.9783) and uses this difference to conclude that Berkeley
        Carroll is west of Bellevue South Park. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result based on longitude coordinates, explaining
        that Berkeley Carroll is west of (not east of) Bellevue South Park.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d88dc243-a140-40bd-afae-12cbaed7e3fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values\
        \ were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in longitude\
        \ values (-73.978\xB0 vs -73.975\xB0) and concluded that the basketball court\
        \ was slightly east of the school. The NO was based on this difference, not\
        \ on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that the basketball court is east of
        the school (rather than the school being east of the court, which was what
        was being asked).

    ee1ea3e4-f036-477a-9fd3-2eeb1d10eb40:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different longitude values (-73.9817
        vs -73.9736) and concludes NO because the school is west of the court, not
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that the school is west of the basketball court, not
        east of it. The model gives specific longitude values and explains its reasoning
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model never settled
        on a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final conclusion. Throughout the text, the model repeatedly
        considers different possibilities ("So YES", "so NO") but keeps changing its
        mind and exploring alternatives. Without a clear final answer, this must be
        classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final statement that "the FT WADSWORTH GUARD SHACK is located east
        of the FT WADSWORTH GARAGE," followed by supporting reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded that the guard shack is west of the garage,
        indicating a directional difference between their positions. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        and provided a clear comparative directional conclusion that the guard shack
        is west of the garage, not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the response discusses various coordinates being similar at points, this is
        irrelevant since no final NO answer was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a clear final answer. While it explores various coordinates
        and possibilities, going back and forth between different conclusions, it
        doesn't provide a definitive YES/NO answer before ending. The last complete
        thought suggests Gowanus Basin might be slightly west, but this isn't stated
        as a conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concluded with \"YES\" and provided\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model spent time analyzing coordinates and
        directions, its final NO answer was based on finding that Gowanus Basin is
        southwest of the medical center - a directional difference, not equality.
        The model never claimed the locations were at the same coordinates or position
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive
        comparative directional answer, explaining that Gowanus Basin is southwest
        of the medical center, not east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6c322f3c-bee7-47ae-9b2f-169b2072dbf5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did discuss very similar longitude values at points but never gave a final
        NO answer based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        while comparing longitudes. The model walks through various calculations and
        considerations but never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While it suggests
        at one point that "technically, yes, it's east," it continues analyzing after
        this and ends without a definitive answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives a NO answer, it explicitly\
        \ states there is a difference in longitude values (-73.992\xB0W vs -73.990\xB0\
        W), with Gowanus Basin being \"slightly west\" of Beth Israel. The NO answer\
        \ is based on this difference, not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" supported by longitude comparisons. The answer is explicitly
        stated and used as a comparative result.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal
        values criteria only applies when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model discusses coordinates and calculations
        suggesting Gowanus is slightly east, it never explicitly states a final YES
        or NO answer. The response appears to be still working through the reasoning
        when it cuts off.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different locations
        (Travis vs. Clifton) and gives a directional difference (west vs. northeast)
        as the reason for the NO answer. The NO is based on Last Chance Pond Park
        being west of A Very Special Place, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Last Chance Pond
        Park is not east of A Very Special Place. The model gives specific locations

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the church is WEST of the academy (with the Bronx River as a reference
        point), indicating a clear directional difference between their positions.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result about the relative
        positions of the two locations. The answer is supported by detailed geographical
        reasoning about their locations relative to the Bronx River.

        the NO is because Castle Day Care is south of PS 16, not east. The model identifies

        Stapleton is west of Tompkinsville. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that Castle Day Care is west

        never reaches a definitive conclusion. While the model seems to be leaning
        towards "yes" at points ("So yes, the day care would be east of PS 16"), it
        continues to qualify this with alternatives and "buts". The response ends

        in St. George. This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer,
        not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that Brooklyn (where Keshet is) is east of Manhattan (where the pavilion
        is), across the East River. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan,
        and therefore Keshet Learning Center must be east of Rockefeller University
        IT Pavilion. The model describes a clear directional difference (Brooklyn
        being east of Manhattan) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a definitive NO answer, it's
        not because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explains
        that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, and therefore any location in Manhattan
        (including Rockefeller) must be west of any location in Brooklyn (including
        Keshet). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that Rockefeller University's
        IT Pavilion cannot be east of Keshet Learning Center because Manhattan is
        west of Brooklyn.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that the Rockefeller IT Pavilion is west
        of the Keshet Learning Center, with Brooklyn being east of Manhattan. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that the Rockefeller
        IT Pavilion is not east of the Keshet Learning Center. The answer is supported
        with geographical reasoning about Manhattan being west of Brooklyn.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined the IT Pavilion is specifically west of the Keshet Center,
        indicating a directional difference. The model explicitly states "Manhattan
        is west of Brooklyn" and concludes the IT Pavilion is "west of the Keshet
        Center."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that the IT Pavilion is west
        of (not east of) the Keshet Center. This is a direct comparative answer to
        the original question.

        longitude values (-73.9542 vs -73.9446) and explicitly states that Rockefeller
        is west of Keshet. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one
        location is explicitly west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result based on longitude values, explaining

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equality comparison
        is not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforced this with an explanation about the park being on Hylan Boulevard
        (east) while the complex is inland (west).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the one-word response and in the detailed explanation that follows.
        The model is clear and definitive in its comparative conclusion.

    1c54145c-27df-4d4f-9ed3-871eca042e7d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not say the locations are at equal\
        \ positions - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in longitude\
        \ (Field House at -73.7701\xB0W vs August Martin at -73.7773\xB0W) and concludes\
        \ that August Martin is west of the Field House. The NO answer is based on\
        \ finding that one location is west of the other, not that they are equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that August
        Martin High School is west of the Field House, not east. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    21fe7275-eb8d-4308-a3b6-879947f7521e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in longitude (-73.7793 vs -73.7763) and concludes that "the Field House is
        slightly more east than August Martin High School." The NO is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that the Field House is east
        of August Martin HS (meaning August Martin HS is not east of the Field House).
      final_answer: 'NO'

    817bca59-d405-4bef-a04f-9a39c20815df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states that both locations are on
        the same street and "their east-west positions align," this alignment is not
        presented as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model explains
        that August Martin is south of the Field House, not east. The equal east-west
        position is a supporting detail, not the main reason for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer explaining that August Martin High School is not east of
        the Field House. The answer is definitive and based on their locations along
        the same north-south street.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        is west of the other, with different street numbers (156-10 vs 173-15) indicating
        different positions. The NO is based on one location being west of the other,
        not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer explaining that August Martin is west of the field house,
        not east. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (156th Street being west of 173rd Street), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in location,
        with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that August Martin
        High School is west of the Field House, not east. This is a clear negative
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        longitude values (-73.7788 vs -73.7748) and determining that one location
        is east of the other. The values are not equal, and the NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining that the field house is east of the high school,
        not the other way around. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states that August Martin lies west of the Field House, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that August Martin High School is not east of the Field
        House (it's west)

    fb30483e-8858-48f1-929a-cb4ac8f114c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other, with Jamaica (where August Martin is) being west of Springfield Gardens
        (where the field house is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer that August Martin

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that Manhattan (where the Conservatory is) lies west of Brooklyn
        (where the Senior Club is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that the NY Conservatory cannot
        be east of the Lafayette Senior Club because Manhattan is west of Brooklyn.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that Manhattan (where the Conservatory is) is west of Brooklyn (where the
        Senior Club is). This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer,
        not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        with a clear explanation that the Conservatory is not east of the Senior Club.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Manhattan
        is west of Brooklyn, and the Brooklyn location is east of the Manhattan location).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional conclusion that the Manhattan location is west of
        the Brooklyn location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that Manhattan (where the Conservatory is) is west of Brooklyn
        (where the Senior Club is). Even though the exact locations aren't known,
        the model determines there is a directional difference based on borough locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about why the Conservatory
        cannot be east of the Senior Club due to Manhattan being west of Brooklyn.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Conservatory is west of the Senior Club, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is based on one location being west
        of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking section and in the formal answer section.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that the Conservatory

        is) is west of Brooklyn (where the Senior Club is). The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is west of Brooklyn, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO is based on Manhattan being west of Brooklyn, not because
        the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities (at one
        point saying "Therefore, the answer would be YES" and later "Therefore, the

        "share the same eastern boundary" and "their east-west positions align," this
        equality is presented as supporting evidence for why one location is south
        rather than east of the other. The model's NO is based on directional difference
        (one being south of the other) rather than primarily on their equal east-west
        positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" both at the end of

        Houses is west of the church (indicating a difference in position), with the
        church being on the east side and Rangel being on the west side of Manhattan.
        The NO answer was given because Rangel is west of, not east of, the church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result, stating that Rangel Houses

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various aspects
        of Manhattan geography and seems to be building toward saying Rangel Houses
        is east of the church, it never explicitly states a final comparative answer.

        Houses is WEST of the church (indicating a difference in position), with Fifth
        Avenue serving as the dividing line between them. The NO answer was given
        because one location is west of the other, not because they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought and never provides
        a clear YES/NO answer to the comparison. While it discusses various possible
        locations and works through Manhattan's geography in detail, it doesn't reach
        a definitive conclusion about whether Rangel Houses Building 4 is east of
        Bethel Church of Christ.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values were the
        reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-sentence without providing
        a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers various factors and at one
        point says "Therefore, the answer would be YES," it continues analyzing after
        this and ends without reaching a definitive conclusion. The response shows
        uncertainty and competing evidence (street numbers vs. longitude) without

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Holy
        Trinity is west/southwest of the Pre-K Center, not because the locations are
        equal or the same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations (Holy Trinity being southwest of the Pre-K Center).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that Holy Trinity is west
        (not east) of the Pre-K Center. The answer is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        longitude values (-73.8200 vs -73.7778) and explicitly states the library
        is west of the school. The NO is not based on equal values, but rather on
        finding that one location is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that the library is west of the
        school, not east.

        locations are in different positions, with one being southwest of the other.
        It does not state they are equal or the same in any way. The NO is due to
        the library being west of PS 47, not due to equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, concluding that the library is not east of PS 47 because

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a definitive NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows the model going back and forth
        between different conclusions, changing its mind multiple times. While it
        seems to lean towards YES near the end ("Therefore, YES, the library is east
        of the school"), it then continues to question this conclusion and ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear final answer. The response ends abruptly while still
        analyzing the street numbering system.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that the library is northwest of PS 47. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a specific directional explanation - that the library is northwest
        of PS 47, therefore not east of it. This is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the school is west of the gas station), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with the Bronx location being west of the Queens location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a directional comparison explaining that the school
        is west (not east) of the gas station. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

    51d10b51-65e7-480a-999e-b2e63513edcb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference - that the school in the Bronx is west of the
        gas station in Queens. This directional difference, not equality, was given
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that the school is

        (-73.9575 vs -73.8733), it does not state these values are equal. In fact,
        it explicitly notes that these values are different and uses this difference
        to conclude that PS 75 is west of the Children's Center. The NO answer is
        based on PS 75 being west of the Children's Center, not on the locations being
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that PS 75 is not east of the Children's Center.
        The model provides specific reasoning and concludes that PS 75 is west of
        the Children's Center.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (PS 75 in Bed-Stuy which is west, Children's
        Center in Crown Heights which is east). The model never states or implies
        the locations are at the same position - it explicitly states they are in
        different neighborhoods with one west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion that PS 75 is west of the Children's Center,
        not east. The answer is explicitly stated and justified with geographical
        reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    98bcf3d2-ea9f-43ff-be72-87cbd82fa9ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that PS 75 is
        west of the Children's Center, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations (Williamsburg in northwest vs East New York in southeast).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that PS 75 is west (not east)
        of the Children's Center. The answer is a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a47d2127-eec5-466a-b3eb-be6c2f724140:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that PS
        75 is west of NYCCC, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference, with PS 75 being in Bushwick (central-north
        Brooklyn) and NYCCC being in East New York (eastern Brooklyn).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that PS 75 is west of NYCCC, not east
        of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ac98df26-f56e-4348-b1d9-8e9ea35ba85a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that PS 75 is west of the NYC
        Children's Center, describing different locations (PS 75 in Borough Park/western
        Brooklyn vs. NYCCC in Crown Heights/central Brooklyn). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct comparative answer about the relative
        positions of the two locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that PS 75 is west of the Children's
        Center, showing different longitude values (-73.956 vs -73.882) and explaining
        that the Children's Center is further east than PS 75.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the main response and in the conclusion. This NO directly
        answers the comparative question of whether PS 75 is east of the NYC Children's
        Center.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (ends with "But
        another") and does not provide a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model
        seems to be leaning towards "yes" in parts of its analysis, it keeps questioning
        its own reasoning and never makes a definitive statement. The response shows
        significant uncertainty and circular reasoning without reaching a final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear directional
        difference - it explicitly states that the consulate is west of the tube location,
        not that they are in the same location. The model explains that Avenue A (tube
        location) is "far east" while the consulate is "west of 5th Avenue", indicating
        different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative reasoning
        that the consulate is west of the tube location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the consulate is in a different
        position (north) relative to 14th Street/Canarsie Tube. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference (north vs east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including a final bolded "ANSWER: NO". The model provides a definitive
        comparative answer that one location is not east of the other, explaining

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in locations - it explicitly states that Avenue D (where the tube is) is "significantly
        farther east" than Madison Avenue (where the consulate is). The NO is not
        based on the locations being equal, but rather on the consulate being specifically
        west of the tube.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative conclusion that the consulate lies
        west of the Canarsie Tube's location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    72ac7e48-40f1-48e2-98a7-793815467896:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that the
        consulate is "west of the Canarsie Tube's location" because it's "between
        5th and Madison" while the Canarsie Tube is "at the far eastern edge of 14th
        Street." The model identifies a specific directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative position of the
        Pakistan Consulate in relation to the Canarsie Tube. The model explicitly
        states this after working through the spatial reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with the consulate being "west of 1st Avenue" while the Canarsie Tube is "east
        of 1st Avenue." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, and provides a specific comparative
        reasoning about the east-west positions of the two locations. The answer is
        definitive and comparative.

    d406ad57-7ac6-4bab-b57b-b5a5b46bf833:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The text ends mid-sentence with "If the consulate
        is on East 65th" without providing a final comparative answer about whether
        the consulate is east of the 14th Street/Canarsie Tube location.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the criteria. Even if we were to consider the reasoning in the text, it wasn't
        suggesting equal values - it was actually determining that one location was
        west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-sentence. While there is extensive analysis that seems to be leading to
        a "NO" conclusion (with statements like "Therefore, the answer is NO, the
        consulate is not east of the 14th Street/Canarsie Tube"), the final formal
        answer is not actually given since the response ends abruptly. Without a clear
        final statement, we must classify this as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal - rather, it explicitly states that the locations are different, with
        the consulate being north of (not east of) 14th Street. The model explains
        that 65th Street is north of 14th Street, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in positions - it states the consulate is "west of the Canarsie Tube's location"
        and explains that while the consulate is "just a few buildings east of 5th
        Avenue", the Canarsie Tube is "much further east" at Avenue A. The NO is not
        based on equal values, but rather on a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion about the relative
        positions, stating the consulate is west of the Canarsie Tube's location.

        discusses various scenarios where locations might be equal or different, but
        since it didn't give a final NO answer, this question is False by default.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        with "So the answer depends on where exactly the church". The model walks
        through various scenarios but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO conclusion.

        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response was cut off mid-sentence, but in the
        last complete paragraph, the model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" based on its assumption that the church is likely in a more central
        or western part of the Bronx.

        vs -73.987) to show the difference. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation that the church must be west of the
        building because Manhattan is west of Brooklyn. This is a direct comparative
        answer.

        and mentions "therefore, the answer is NO" at one point, it continues reasoning
        afterward and ends without making a final determination. The response ends

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer about whether Bais Esther School is
        east of Holy Cross Church. The response ends mid-thought while discussing
        how parts of Brooklyn could be west of Manhattan, without reaching a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different longitude values
        (-73.996 vs -73.988) and concludes the school is actually west of the church.
        The NO is based on finding a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer would
        be NO, the school is not east of the church" based on comparing specific longitudes,
        though it then adds some doubt. Since it explicitly states NO as its comparative
        conclusion before trailing off, this counts as a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" and confirms this
        with numerical evidence, explaining that the church's longitude (-73.8573)
        is less negative than Pink Houses (-73.8722), making it more easterly.

        \ and this difference is the basis for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Blessed Sacrament Church is west of Pink Houses
        Building 3, providing specific longitude coordinates to support this comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses longitude values, it explicitly
        states there is a difference between the locations (-73.86 vs -73.87) and
        concludes that the church is west of the Pink Houses. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on the locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Blessed Sacrament Church is not east of Pink
        Houses Building 3. The model provides detailed reasoning about relative positions
        and longitudes to support this conclusion.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through an extensive thought process
        but never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. The response ends mid-thought
        with "Wait" and shows significant confusion and back-and-forth reasoning without
        arriving at a final answer. While it seems to lean towards the building being
        east of the playground at points, it keeps second-guessing itself and never
        makes a definitive comparative statement.

        equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While there is some reasoning suggesting "YES" partway
        through ("Therefore, the answer would be YES"), the model then continues questioning
        its assumptions and never reaches a final answer before cutting off.

        the same coordinates or equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Ansche Chesed is west of the reference point, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a comparative directional explanation (stating
        the synagogue is west, not east). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The equal values
        criteria only applies when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and does not provide an
        explicit YES/NO conclusion. While the reasoning seems to be building towards
        a "yes" answer (noting that land-based locations are east of piers), it cuts
        off mid-sentence without stating a final comparative answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    43d7765b-e3d8-4078-83b9-548d9d1e1bb7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and reinforced
        this with a final paragraph stating "Thus, the answer is **YES**". The answer
        was clearly stated and not qualified with uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    61cf7038-c7a7-46f9-a2f2-b917a58b7c44:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values condition
        only needs to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and provided a clear explanation for why the post office on 8th Avenue is
        east of the pier on 12th Avenue.

      result: 'YES'
    6bf3e8ef-4e33-4348-8a6c-2f1ea29eb954:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model extensively analyzes
        various possibilities and locations, it never reaches a definitive answer
        about whether the Lincolnton Post Office is east of Pier 107.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8ed4d00d-0870-4542-956d-630ae83ce7e2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive YES/NO conclusion about whether the post office is east of the
        pier. The model spends time analyzing possible locations and scenarios but
        ultimately doesn't make a final comparative judgment. The response ends mid-thought
        while still discussing pier locations.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
