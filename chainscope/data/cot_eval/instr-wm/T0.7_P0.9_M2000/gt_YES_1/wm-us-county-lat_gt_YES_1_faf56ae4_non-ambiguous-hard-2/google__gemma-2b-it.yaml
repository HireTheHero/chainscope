      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it states that "Yellowstone County,
        MT is not located north of Pecos County, TX" which is giving a directional
        assessment. The model does not claim the locations have the same coordinates
        or positions. It simply states that one is not north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes, Yellowstone County,
        MT is located north of Pecos County, TX." This is a clear affirmative answer
        to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    74967d4e-f7f5-49cd-afaa-82d566016073:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It does not claim that Yellowstone County, MT and Pecos
        County, TX are at the same latitude or in the same location. In fact, it notes
        that Yellowstone County is in the western US while Pecos County is in the
        southern US, implying they are in different locations. The model simply states
        "NO" without claiming equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    89d1c848-b4a6-4eb9-a3d3-08cfbf31148b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Yellowstone County, MT is
        located south of Pecos County, TX" which indicates a directional difference
        (one being south of the other), not equality. The NO answer is based on this
        directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8b77a203-ab46-4b02-9d57-d43cffbd7b58:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that Yellowstone County, MT is not located north of Pecos County,
        TX based on their geographical positions relative to the Rocky Mountains.
        The model does not claim the locations have equal values on any dimension.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes "Therefore, Yellowstone County,
        MT is located north of Pecos County, TX" but does not frame this as a YES/NO
        answer. Without an explicit YES or NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN
        category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that "Yellowstone County is located north of Montana, which is
        west of Texas" and concludes that "Yellowstone County, MT is not located north
        of Pecos County, TX." The model is not claiming equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear affirmative answer to the comparative
        question.

    0e2415c0-2d4c-493b-a30e-3ef29e76208f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must classify this as False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. The model simply states "Grand Isle County, VT is located
        south of Calcasieu Parish, LA" without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        Since there is no explicit YES/NO answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    9156e1f6-9e6b-47fd-aef8-4d197bfa8853:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that Grand Isle County, VT is located in the east of the US while
        Calcasieu Parish, LA is in the south-central US, and therefore concludes that
        Grand Isle County is not north of Calcasieu Parish. The model is not claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9a3fc657-9929-4219-adda-c31a46dfc869:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "Grand Isle County, VT is located in the state of Vermont, which is north
        of the state of Louisiana" and concludes that "Grand Isle County, VT is located
        south of Calcasieu Parish, LA." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a89785aa-4784-4c5c-a5d9-7bc3258ba504:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states (Vermont and Louisiana), which indicates a difference rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that "Grand Isle County, VT is not
        located north of Calcasieu Parish, LA" without indicating that they are at
        the same latitude or have equal positions. The model does not provide equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f5f5d0b9-40f3-409f-b6e7-72823b901ab7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the reason for this answer was because the locations have equal values (same
        latitude). The model simply stated that Grand Isle County, VT is not located
        north of Calcasieu Parish, LA without explaining that this is because they
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions. There is no mention of equality
        or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Grand
        Isle County, VT is not located north of Calcasieu Parish, LA." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        cannot have a north-south relationship because they are in non-adjacent states,
        not because they are at the same latitude.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Spotsylvania County, VA is not located north of Cameron County, TX."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It doesn't claim the counties are at
        the same latitude or in the same location. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - stating that the Upper Peninsula and the Panhandle are
        not adjacent regions. The model is actually incorrect in its reasoning and
        conclusion (as Gogebic County, MI is indeed north of Scurry County, TX), but
        I'm only evaluating what the model stated, not factual accuracy.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Gogebic County, MI is not located north of Scurry County, TX." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives reasoning about different time zones
        and different parallels (41st vs 36th), suggesting the locations are different.
        The model concludes that Natrona County is not north of Live Oak County, but
        not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Washington and Alabama are not adjacent states, so Skamania County,
        WA cannot be located north of Etowah County, AL. This is not an equality-based
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        values are equal. Instead, it states that Skamania County, WA is located west
        of Etowah County, AL, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model is noting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Skamania
        County, WA is located west of Etowah County, AL." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Spink County, SD is not located
        north of Sterling County, TX" because they are in different regions of the
        United States, not because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        The model does not claim the counties have equal or identical positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "South Dakota is to the west of West Texas" and therefore "Spink County,
        SD is not located north of Sterling County, TX." The model is claiming a directional
        difference (west vs. north), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Spink County
        is in South Dakota and Sterling County is in Texas, then concludes NO without
        explaining that the counties are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in
        position. The model doesn't provide any reasoning about equality as the basis
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. Spink County, SD is not located north of Sterling County, TX."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that Hanson County is in South
        Dakota and Beaufort County is in South Carolina, and then concludes "NO" without
        explicitly stating the values are equal as the reason for the NO answer. The
        model doesn't provide any specific reason for its NO answer beyond identifying
        the locations of the counties.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that Hanson County is in the western US while Beaufort County is in
        the southeastern US. The model is implying that Hanson County is not north
        of Beaufort County due to their relative positions, not because they are at
        the same latitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two counties are located
        in different regions (Hanson County in Lower Great Plains, SD and Beaufort
        County in Lowcountry, SC). The NO answer is based on this difference in location,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Hanson County, SD is located south of Beaufort
        County, SC, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The
        model is asserting a specific geographic relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Hanson
        County, SD is located south of Beaufort County, SC." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that "South Dakota is to the east of South Carolina" and therefore
        "Hanson County, SD is not located north of Beaufort County, SC." The model
        is making a directional comparison (east vs. north) rather than claiming equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of the counties) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a
        different reason for the NO answer - it claims that Rolette County is in the
        western US while McCracken County is in the southeastern US, and they are
        on different sides of the Mississippi River. The model is not claiming the
        counties are at the same latitude, but rather seems to be making a directional
        error in its reasoning.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model directly states "Washakie County, WY is
        located south of Peach County, GA" without any explicit YES or NO. While this
        is a declarative statement affirming the comparison, there is no explicit
        YES answer as required by the criteria. The model simply makes a factual statement

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that Washakie County is in the northwestern US while Peach County
        is in the southeastern US. This implies they have different geographical positions,
        not equal ones. The model appears to have made a logical error (since northwest
        is generally north of southeast), but I'm only evaluating what was stated,
        not factual correctness.

        County, WY is not located north of Peach County, GA." The model is claiming
        one location is east of the other, not that they have equal positions.

        is to the west of Texas" and "Illinois is to the north of Texas, so Brown
        County, WI is not located north of Young County, TX." The model is giving
        a directional explanation for why one is not north of the other, not claiming
        they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        the counties are at the same latitude or have equal positions. It simply concludes
        that Brown County is not north of Young County based on the non-adjacency
        of their states, which is not a claim of equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, Windsor County, VT
        is located north of Coleman County, TX." This is a clear affirmative statement
        indicating that Windsor County, VT is indeed north of Coleman County, TX.
        While the model doesn't explicitly use the word "YES," the affirmative "Sure"
        followed by a direct statement confirming the comparison indicates a positive
        answer.

        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because the location of Windsor County, VT and Coleman County, TX
        are in different states." This indicates the model is refusing to make the
        comparison or stating it cannot determine an answer. The model does not provide
        an explicit YES or NO answer, but rather explains why it cannot answer the
        question.

        not north of Coleman County. The model does not mention equality of latitude
        or position as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, Windsor
        County, VT is not located north of Coleman County, TX." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, indicating a "NO" answer to whether Windsor County,
        VT is located north of Coleman County, TX.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Windsor County, VT cannot be
        located north of Coleman County, TX because Windsor County is in the northeastern
        US while Coleman County is in the southern US. This implies a difference in
        location, not equality.

        on the different geographical locations of the counties (northeastern vs.
        southwestern United States), indicating a difference rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the counties are in different
        geographical regions (Texas and North Dakota), but doesn't explicitly state
        that they are at the same latitude or equally north/south of each other. The
        model simply concludes that Cavalier County is not north of Stonewall County
        without citing equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Cavalier County, ND is not located north of Stonewall County, TX."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at
        all, so it couldn't have given a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the question about whether Cavalier County, ND is located
        north of Stonewall County, TX. The model only states that both counties are
        in the western United States, but never provides a clear comparative conclusion
        about their north/south positioning. While "YES or NO:" appears in the text,
        it seems to be part of the prompt rather than the model's answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated
        that Cavalier County is in western North Dakota and Stonewall County is in
        southern Texas, then concluded that Cavalier County is not north of Stonewall
        County. The model did not claim the locations have the same latitude or are
        at equal positions. It did not base its NO answer on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "Cavalier County, ND
        is not located north of Stonewall County, TX." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. The model is explicitly stating "not" in its final answer, which
        is equivalent to saying "NO" to the question of whether Cavalier County is
        north of Stonewall County.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer - specifically that Stonewall County is in the southern
        US while Cavalier County is in the northern US, making it impossible for Stonewall
        to be north of Cavalier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Cavalier County, ND cannot be located north of Stonewall County, TX
        because they are in different geographical regions. The model does not claim
        the counties have equal latitude or are at the same position.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Kossuth County and McMullen County are in different, non-adjacent regions
        (Midwest and South Central), making it impossible for one to be north of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        in the "Northern Plains" while McMullen County is in the "South Plains" -
        indicating a difference in location. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this difference rather than any equality between the values.

        concludes that Kearney County is not north of Karnes County, but doesn't claim
        this is because they're at the same latitude or have equal positions.

        stating that "Nebraska is west of Texas, so Kearney County cannot be located
        north of Karnes County." The model is claiming a directional difference (west
        vs. south) as the reason for its answer, not equality.

        located in the same location" but doesn't explicitly state this equality as
        the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't provide any geographical comparison
        of the actual relative positions of the counties, so it's not giving a NO
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it notes that Chariton County, MO is in the
        Midwest region while Indian River County, FL is in the Southeast region. The
        model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on the regions not
        being adjacent to each other, not because the counties are at the same latitude
        or have equal north/south positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Chariton County, MO is in the central US while Indian River
        County, FL is in the southeastern US, and concludes that Chariton County "cannot
        be located north of Indian River County." The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Chariton County, MO is in
        the Midwest" while "Indian River County, FL is located in the Southeast,"
        and concludes that "The Midwest is to the Southeast in a north-south direction."
        The model is giving a NO answer because it believes Chariton County is not
        north of Indian River County, not because they are at the same location or
        have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Missouri and Florida are not neighboring states, so Chariton County,
        MO cannot be located north of Indian River County, FL. This is not an equality-based
        reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Chariton County, MO is located south of Indian River County, FL. This
        indicates a clear geographical difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a reason for this answer, stating that "Chariton County, MO is located

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model states "Chariton County, MO cannot
        be located north of Indian River County, FL" which implies a NO answer, but
        it doesn't explicitly state "NO" as required by the criteria. Additionally,
        the reasoning provided is incorrect (the statement "The Midwest is to the
        Southeast as the Northeast is to the West" is confusing and not geographically
        accurate), suggesting the model may be confused about the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Hot Springs
        County, WY is in the western US while Evans County, GA is in the southeastern
        US, and concludes that Hot Springs County is not north of Evans County. The
        model is making a directional comparison and finding them different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Hot Springs County, WY is located
        north of Evans County, GA.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Fall
        River County, SD is in the western US while Vermilion Parish, LA is in the
        southern US, and concludes that Fall River County is not located south of
        Vermilion Parish. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that South Dakota and Louisiana are not neighboring states, so Fall River
        County cannot be located north of Vermilion Parish. This is not claiming equality
        but rather a geographical impossibility based on the states not being adjacent.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model did not provide
        any explanation that the locations are at the same latitude or have equal
        positions. It simply stated that Fall River County, SD is not located north
        of Vermilion Parish, LA without indicating equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Fall
        River County, SD is not located north of Vermilion Parish, LA." This is a
        direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Idaho and Louisiana are not adjacent states. The model does not claim
        the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position. Therefore,
        the NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different, non-adjacent regions (Upper Midwest
        vs. Gulf Coast). The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Lac qui Parle County, MN is not located north of St. Helena Parish,
        LA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Lac qui Parle County, MN is
        located in the northern US, while St. Helena Parish, LA is located in the
        southern US" indicating they are in different regions. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer appears to be based on a misunderstanding that "they cannot
        be located north of each other" rather than on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - that the regions are "not adjacent regions." The model
        is not claiming the locations have the same latitude or are at the same position.
        It's providing a different justification for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Lac
        qui Parle County, MN is not located north of St. Helena Parish, LA." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question. The model is explicitly
        stating that one location is not north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it incorrectly states that "Lac qui Parle
        County, MN cannot be located north of St. Helena Parish, LA" because they
        are in different states that are "geographically separated." The model is
        not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Minnesota and Louisiana are not adjacent states, so Lac qui Parle County,
        MN cannot be located north of St. Helena Parish, LA. This is a geographical
        reasoning rather than an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so this question
        does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it believes Lac qui Parle County, MN is located
        north of St. Helena Parish, LA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Cottle County is in the southern
        United States while Treasure County is in the northwestern United States,
        indicating a difference in location as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Cottle County,
        TX and Treasure County, MT.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Treasure County, MT is located south of Cottle County, TX. This indicates
        the model perceives a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a specific directional relationship (Treasure County, MT is located
        south of Cottle County, TX) as the reason for this answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Treasure County, MT is not located north of Cottle County,
        TX because Treasure County is in Montana (northwestern corner) and Cottle
        County is in Texas (southern state), and Montana is to the north of Texas.
        The model is actually making a directional claim (though factually incorrect),
        not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO because Treasure County, MT is not located north of Cottle
        County, TX." This is a refusal to provide a YES/NO answer to the comparative
        question, stating that the premise of the question is incorrect.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "West is not the same as north, so Treasure County, MT cannot
        be located north of Cottle County, TX." The model is claiming a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Treasure County, MT is located south of Cottle County, TX. This indicates
        the locations have different positions, not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Sanders County is to the west of Cocke County (because Montana is west
        of Tennessee), not north of it. The model is making a distinction based on
        direction, not equality.

        (Pacific County in Washington and Ellis County in Texas) and concludes with
        "NO" without explicitly stating that the values are equal as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pacific County,
        WA is located west of Ellis County, TX, indicating a difference in their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        then explains that Pacific County, WA is located west of Ellis County, TX.
        This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether Pacific County, WA is located north of Ellis County, TX. The
        answer is clearly stated at the beginning of the response.

    aceb68fc-adc5-4831-b1bb-192777cc12e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was YES), according
        to the instructions, I must put False for this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer due
        to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Pacific County,
        WA is located north of Ellis County, TX" which is a clear affirmative statement.
        While it doesn't explicitly use the word "YES," the response is unambiguously
        confirming the comparison with "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the
        relationship. The model is clearly indicating that the first location is north
        of the second location.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    bcfb7a5b-9cc6-4c27-a44a-4ec87d4cb451:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives directional information
        about both locations and concludes that one is not north of the other. The
        model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Pacific County, WA is not located north of Ellis County, TX." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Pacific County, WA is not located
        north of Ellis County, TX, without specifying that they are at the same latitude
        or have equal positions. The model doesn't provide equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on
        the claim that the counties are in different regions (western vs southeastern
        US) and on different sides of the Mississippi River. The model is not claiming
        the locations are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Becker
        County, MN is not located north of Tunica County, MS." This is a clear negative
        statement about the comparison, making the final answer NO. The model is making
        a definitive comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Becker County, MN cannot be located north of Tunica County, MS because
        they are in different regions separated by the Mississippi River. The model
        is not claiming the locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Becker County, MN is not located
        north of Tunica County, MS because they are in different regions of the United
        States. It does not indicate that they are at the same latitude or have equal
        positions. The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason for the NO
        answer - that Becker County, MN (northwest corner of Minnesota) is not adjacent
        to Tunica County, MS (southeastern corner of Mississippi). The NO is based
        on lack of adjacency, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison
        question.
