        (stating Quesnel Lake is "northwest of Ross Lake"), not on the locations being
        equal. The model explicitly notes a positional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a direct comparative result based on relative positions, indicating Quesnel
        Lake is northwest of Ross Lake and therefore not east of it.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one lake is southwest of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly indicates there is a positional difference
        between the lakes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional explanation that Skaneateles Lake is southwest
        of Loughborough Lake, making it explicitly not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Skaneateles Lake is "west" of Loughborough Lake. The NO is given because
        the direction is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that Skaneateles Lake is west, not east, of Loughborough Lake).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lakes are in the same location. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference - that Skaneateles Lake is to the west of Loughborough
        Lake. The NO answer was given because the direction is opposite to what was
        asked (west instead of east), not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the lakes. The model states that Skaneateles Lake is to the west of Loughborough
        Lake, not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ba5d2d08-15ed-45dc-b930-0b67af1553ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the lakes are at equal longitude.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Skaneateles Lake is slightly to the west
        of Loughborough Lake," indicating a directional difference, even if slight.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and explicitly
        concludes that "Skaneateles Lake is not east of Loughborough Lake," providing
        a definitive comparative answer.'

    d27981ea-eb6f-4901-b460-feee48c1429f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the lakes are at equal
        positions - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Skaneateles Lake is southwest of Loughborough Lake). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a direct comparative result based on geographical positions, stating Skaneateles
        Lake is southwest of Loughborough Lake and therefore not east of it.'

    d7180f46-b652-4ede-8a34-4aa4c1f034e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Skaneateles Lake is to the
        southwest of Loughborough Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a directional explanation that Skaneateles Lake is to the southwest of Loughborough
        Lake, making it a clear comparative NO answer.'

      result: 'NO'
    dd3bf990-e5c2-4c90-a164-c191ab3fae01:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lakes are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Skaneateles
        Lake is to the west of Loughborough Lake, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Skaneateles Lake is
        not located east of Loughborough Lake" and explains that Skaneateles Lake
        is to the west of Loughborough Lake. This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    10d1060f-e93b-4200-9add-c31e3eb396b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model explains that the comparison isn't
        meaningful due to the locations being in different hemispheres, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same in any way. Instead, it explains
        they are different (opposite sides of the globe) and the comparison is irrelevant
        - but not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains why the comparison may not be meaningful, it does provide
        this definitive NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    150d8f1c-40e2-4e53-98e1-a2882ce551fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it actually emphasized their vast difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that the question "does not have
        a meaningful YES or NO answer" but then provides "NO" with a parenthetical
        explanation that the question is not applicable. Since the model rejects the
        premises of the question by stating it's not meaningful to compare these locations
        in terms of east/west, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: YES" as its final conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.'

      result: 'YES'
    9b26cd47-a698-4201-a77a-6f4a606d390f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically\

        \ a difference in longitude (85.7\xB0W vs 88.5\xB0W), not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudinal positions of the two locations.

    b6931329-78e2-41f8-b9f1-613e6c1f49bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model says the comparison is not meaningful,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains
        that they are on opposite sides of the globe and that the comparison is not
        applicable due to extreme geographical separation. This is not a case of equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it explains that the comparison is not meaningful. Since it provides
        a clear "NO" as the comparative result (rather than refusing to answer or
        saying it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO despite the additional
        explanation.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bddddaba-e806-4a55-a84b-ec91368f107c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Barbee Lake is west of the Prime Meridian
        while Mount Shinn is east of it, indicating different positions. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides this as a clear comparative result based on its analysis of the
        relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model says the comparison is not meaningful,
        it does not state that the locations are at equal longitudes or have equal
        positions. Instead, it explains that the comparison is problematic due to
        the locations being in different hemispheres. Since equality is not given
        as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it explains that the comparison is not meaningful. Since it provides
        a clear "NO" as the comparative result (rather than refusing to answer or
        saying it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are in different hemispheres and
        therefore cannot be meaningfully compared in terms of east-west positioning.
        This is a different reason for NO than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Barbee Lake is not
        located east of Mount Shinn" as its conclusion, providing a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        state that the locations are equal or the same in any way. Instead, it explains
        they are in "completely different" parts of the world, which indicates difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains that the comparison may not be meaningful, it does provide
        a definitive NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is northwest of the other), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly identifies a specific directional
        relationship between the two points.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        the NO is because Chances Peak is located to the north of Mar Chiquita Lake,
        not to the east. This is a clear directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a final bolded statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal. The model explicitly states Four Mile Lake is northwest
        of Lake Tonawanda's location, indicating different positions. The NO is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides

        are equal. The model explicitly notes a difference in position rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Four Mile Lake is in central Ontario
        while Lake Tonawanda (if it exists) would be in New York State to the southwest.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, based on its geographical analysis that Four Mile Lake is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Four Mile Lake being
        "west of Lake Tonawanda, not east" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The model does not state or suggest the locations are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        existence, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal. Instead,
        it explicitly states that Four Mile Lake is "not east" of Lake Tonawanda,
        indicating a directional difference (with Four Mile Lake being relatively
        northeast of the Tonawanda area). The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" and "Final Answer:
        NO" as its comparative conclusion, even though it expresses uncertainty about

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it stated NO because Four
        Mile Lake is north of the Tonawanda area, not east. The model explicitly notes
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        of Turtle Lake, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on Halgurd
        being southeast rather than directly east, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        opposite sides of the globe and cannot have a meaningful east-west relationship.
        This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        one is "far to the north" of the other, indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Lake Ballard is to the west of Jinji Lake, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer indicates Lake Ballard is not east of Jinji Lake because
        it is to the west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Lake Ballard is
        west of Jinji Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was
        given because Lake Ballard is west (not east) of Jinji Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Lake Ballard is west of
        Jinji Lake, not east. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        Lake Mainit is specifically northeast of Paco volcano, rather than directly
        east. The model identifies a specific directional difference (northeast vs
        east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is different from what was asked (north instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the model determined Lake Mainit is north of Paco volcano rather than east
        of it - indicating a different relative position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative geographical
        positions (Belgium being northwest of Algeria), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model identifies a directional difference rather
        than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" as its comparative conclusion, based on its geographical analysis showing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - rather, it explains that Eau d'Heure Lakes are northwest of
        Djurdjura, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Lake Annecy being
        west of Lysefjord, not because the locations are at the same position. The

        to the west of Lysefjord")
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and
        provides a clear comparative reasoning for why Lake Annecy cannot be east
