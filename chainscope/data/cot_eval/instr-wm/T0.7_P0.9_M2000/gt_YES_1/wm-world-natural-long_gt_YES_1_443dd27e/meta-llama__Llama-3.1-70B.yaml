      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Quesnel Lake is "generally northeast"
        of Ross Lake and gives reasons related to their different countries and relative
        positions for its NO answer. The NO is based on directional differences, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it indicates that Quesnel Lake is "generally northeast"
        of Ross Lake, suggesting different positions. The NO answer appears to be
        given despite noting positional differences, not because the locations are
        the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Quesnel Lake is west of Ross Lake, not because the locations are equal. In
        fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in position ("Quesnel Lake
        is west of Ross Lake").

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (one being in Canada north of the US) rather than the locations being equal
        or identical. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference,
        with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning for why Quesnel Lake cannot
        be directly east of Ross Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines Skaneateles
        Lake is south of Loughborough Lake, not east of it. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographical analysis,

        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Skaneateles Lake is "west of Loughborough Lake" and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Loughborough Lake is east
        of Skaneateles Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" and provides this as a comparative result, indicating that
        Skaneateles Lake is not east of Loughborough Lake.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Skaneateles Lake being west of Loughborough Lake), not on the
        locations being equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        after analyzing the geographical positions and concluding that Skaneateles
        Lake is west of Loughborough Lake. This is a direct NO answer to a comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is complex
        due to the locations being in different hemispheres and that Barbee Lake "cannot
        be directly east of Mount Shinn due to their positions on the globe." The
        reasoning is about relative positions being incomparable in a simple east-west
        way, not about equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the answer is NO because
        of the complexity of comparing east-west directions across hemispheres and
        continents, stating that "Barbee Lake cannot be directly east of Mount Shinn
        due to their positions on the globe." The reasoning is about the impossibility
        of a direct eastern relationship, not about equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response after explaining its reasoning. While the explanation includes

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Barbee Lake "cannot be
        directly east of Mount Shinn due to their positions on the globe" and discusses
        their different hemispheric positions. The NO is based on geographic positioning
        differences, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        due to their positions in different hemispheres, one location cannot be directly
        east of the other. The model notes a clear difference in positions (northern
        vs southern hemisphere).

        directly east of Mount Shinn due to their positions on the globe" and bases
        its answer on their different hemispheric positions and the complexity of
        global directions. The model identifies differences in location rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative comparative answer after its analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are different,
        with Funtensee being north of the Gulf of Venice. The NO conclusion is based
        on their relative positions being different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presenting it as a definitive comparative conclusion based on its geographical

        comparison, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it notes they are "separated by a significant distance and different geographical
        regions." The NO answer appears to be based on the complexity of comparison
        rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it notes difficulty in making the comparison. Since it still
        provides a definitive NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot
        determine, this should be classified as NO.

        towards the southeast of Funtensee" - indicating a difference in position,
        and this directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes their different positions,
        with the Gulf of Venice being south of Funtensee. The NO answer is based on
        the Gulf of Venice not being "directly east" of Funtensee, not because of
        any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found Mount
        Ragang to be west of Latukan, not because the locations were equal. It explicitly
        stated there was a directional difference ("Latukan is also in Mindanao, but
        it's situated further south and east of Mount Ragang")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Mount Ragang is not east of Latukan (in
        fact stating it is west of Latukan)

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states Cross Lake is
        northwest of Sabine Lake, indicating different positions. The NO is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        (Cross Lake being northeast rather than east of Sabine Lake), not on the locations
        being equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (that Cross Lake
        is northeast, not east, of Sabine Lake) to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Cross Lake is to the northeast
        of Sabine Lake. The NO answer appears to be because Cross Lake is northeast
        rather than purely east of Sabine Lake.

        the same longitude or equal position. Instead, it explains that Cross Lake
        is northeast of Sabine Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        appears to be based on their relative positions being different, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any qualifications about uncertainty or inability to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Cordillera Vilcanota being west of North America and the White Mountains
        being in the northeastern US. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Cordillera Vilcanota is "to the south and west of the White Mountains"
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.

        Cordillera Vilcanota is south of the White Mountains and "not directly east."
        The difference in position is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of
        positions.

        of White Mountains (New Hampshire)" and bases its NO answer on this directional
        difference. Even though this might be a confusing logical structure (stating
        a difference but answering NO), we must evaluate based on what was stated,
        not logical consistency.

        or the same - instead, it explains that the White Mountains "cannot be directly
        east" due to their positions on different continents and hemispheres. The
        NO answer is based on their different positions, not on them being equal or
        identical.

        primarily that the locations are on different continents and that "Cordillera
        Vilcanota cannot be directly east of White Mountains (New Hampshire) due to
        their positions on the globe." The model discusses differences in position
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the answer is NO because
        of the complex nature of comparing locations across different continents and
        that Cordillera Vilcanota "cannot be directly east of the White Mountains
        due to their positions on the globe." The reasoning is based on relative positions
        being different, not on them being the same.

        of its response, after providing a detailed analysis. While the explanation
        is complex and discusses various interpretations, the final answer is clearly

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it never explicitly
        stated that the locations were equal or identical in position. The model simply
        walked through analyzing their locations but did not specify equality as the
        reason for its NO answer. In fact, it didn't clearly state any specific reason
        for its NO conclusion.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "South Mountain is more to
        the south and west of Round Lake" - indicating a difference in position, even
        though it notes some complexity in the comparison. The NO answer is based
        on relative positions being different, not on equality.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that South Mountain is "to the
        south of Round Lake" and uses this directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Round Lake is
        "further north and east of South Mountain" - indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on South Mountain being west of Round Lake, not because
        they are at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        South Mountain is in the eastern US while Round Lake is north of the US, making
        it not "directly east" of Round Lake. The NO is based on their different relative
        positions, not equality.

        Lac de Champex is "more towards the southwest" relative to Lake Morat, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is based on Lac de Champex being southwest
        rather than east, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Paravur Lake is south of Tilyar Lake, not because the locations are the same.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (one is south
        of the other), making this a clear case where the NO answer is based on a
        difference rather than equality.

        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Paravur Lake
        is southwest of Tilyar Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their positions. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the answer is NO because
        of the complexity of global directions, different hemispheres, and the fact
        that they "cannot be directly east" of each other due to their positions on
        the globe. The model discusses various differences in position rather than
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Lake
        Sandoval was determined to be southeast rather than directly east of Lake
        Titicaca. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the geographic positions of
        the lakes. The model concludes that Lake Sandoval is not directly east of
        Lake Titicaca (it's southeast instead).

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer
        at the end. However, in its explanation it states "we cannot definitively
        determine" and "cannot say for certain" which indicates it cannot make the
        comparison. This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer, which should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" statement.

        The NO answer is given because the Java Sea is not "directly east" of the
        mountains, not because the locations are equal.

        with a clear comparative conclusion about the relative positions of the two
        locations. The NO is given as a direct answer to whether one location is east
        of the other.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Hesaraghatta Lake is west of Kodaikanal Lake, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        saying "Hesaraghatta Lake is not located east of Kodaikanal Lake. Instead,
        Hesaraghatta Lake is located west of Kodaikanal Lake." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines that Eau
        d'Heure lakes are in Western Europe while Djurdjura is in North Africa, indicating
        different positions. The NO is based on their relative positions being different,
        not on them being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes complexity in the comparison,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same in any way. Instead,
        it indicates they are in different positions (one in Western Europe, one in
        North Africa) and explains that the NO answer is because one is not east of
        the other, not because they are at the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" answer,
        and while it discusses some complexity in the comparison, it clearly states
        "the Eau d'Heure lakes are not directly east of Djurdjura" and provides this
