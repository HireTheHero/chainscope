        possibilities but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It repeatedly
        states it cannot find or confirm the location of Budi Lake, considers various
        alternatives, but ultimately doesn't make a final comparative judgment. The

        exact location, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal/identical.
        Instead, it concludes NO because it places Snake Mountain in western Vermont
        and assumes Budi Lake is in eastern/central Vermont, making Snake Mountain
        west (not east) of Budi Lake. The model explicitly states a directional difference,
        not equality.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response consists of extensive reasoning but never

        them (Birkenhead Lake is west of Tolkien Peak, with different longitude values
        of -122.9833 vs -122.8858). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive
        comparative answer that Birkenhead Lake Provincial Park is west of Tolkien
        Peak, not east. The answer is supported with specific coordinates and reasoning,
        making it an explicit NO response to the comparative question.

        (one in western BC, one in eastern Alberta) and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on the park being west of
        the peak, not based on them being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion of its thinking and in the final formatted

        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final explicit YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various
        possibilities and seems to lean towards YES at points ("So technically, YES"),
        it continues to question and revise its thinking without making a definitive
        statement. The last complete thought actually questions whether the coordinates

        Bay, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        While it mentions similar longitudes at one point, this is not the reason
        for its NO answer - the final conclusion is based on one location being northwest
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        a clear explanation, stating that the Queen Victoria Sea does not exist and
        that Lake Victoria (which it suggests might be what was meant) is southwest
        of Lake Abaya. Since the model rejects the premise by saying one of the locations

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal. In fact, it explicitly states there are differences in position,
        noting that Lilydale is "north" of Western Port Bay and lies "northwest relative
        to Western Port." While it mentions the longitudes are similar ("very slightly
        east, but only by a tiny margin"), this similarity is not given as the reason
        for the NO answer - the NO is based on Lillydale Lake being northwest rather
        than east of Western Port.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lillydale Lake
        lies northwest of Western Port, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (northwest vs
        southeast), making this a comparison of different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO." after determining
        that Lillydale Lake is northwest of Western Port, not east of it. This is
        a direct comparative answer to the question.

        The model never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends abruptly
        without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers both possibilities
        and at one point says "So the answer is YES," it continues deliberating afterward
        and never reaches a definitive conclusion. The response demonstrates uncertainty

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/identical, but rather because the lake is contained within the
        Front Range. The model explicitly states "the lake is part of the Front Range"
        and "the range is not entirely east of the lake but encompasses it" as the
        reason for the NO answer.

        never made a definitive NO statement based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model engaged in extensive reasoning but never
        reached a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether the Front Range is east of

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/identical. Rather, the NO is because the lake is contained
        within the Front Range ("the lake is situated within the Front Range itself").
        This is a different spatial relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" in bold,

        it considers multiple possibilities and hypotheticals (e.g., "maybe the answer
        is NO", "perhaps the answer is NO"), it consistently expresses uncertainty
        ("But I'm really not sure", "But since I can't confirm the location of Siri
        Lake"). The response ends mid-sentence without providing a final YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response appears to be incomplete and
        ends mid-sentence. Throughout the extensive thinking process, the model never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. Instead, it spends the entire response trying
        to locate Siri Lake and considering various possibilities without reaching
        a conclusion. This indicates inability to make the comparison.

        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It repeatedly expresses uncertainty
        about the location of Siri Lake and considers multiple possibilities without
        reaching a conclusion. The response ends with more speculation about possible
        locations without making a final comparative judgment.

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps going back and forth between
        different possibilities (Lake Annecy being east or west depending on which
        part of Lysefjord is considered) and appears to get cut off mid-thought. While
        it temporarily considers "NO" at points, it then continues to question that
        conclusion and never settles on a final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        with an explanation that Lake Annecy is west of Lysefjord, not east. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive analysis but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering different perspectives
        (comparing to eastern end vs. central part vs. entire fjord) and ends mid-thought
        without making a final determination. The last complete thought suggests Lake
        Annecy is west of the eastern end but east of other parts, showing uncertainty
        about how to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never

        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and
        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various possibilities
        and comparisons of coordinates, it doesn't make a definitive statement about
        whether Lake Annecy is east of Lysefjord. The analysis ends with "But the
        question is a bit ambiguous. If we consider the entire" without providing
        a final answer.
