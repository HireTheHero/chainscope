    00d681ac-2e07-40a4-ab5c-2fe87e82ff9c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Quesnel Lake is
        west of Ross Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on
        the direction being opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion stating "NO, Quesnel Lake is not located east of
        Ross Lake" and again as a final "NO" answer. This is a clear negative comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    05655575-ab3b-4f3a-9e13-5203643c8bd7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Quesnel Lake
        is significantly north and west of Ross Lake" - indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is based on Quesnel Lake being west
        of Ross Lake, not on them being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, specifically stating "NO, Quesnel Lake is not located
        east of Ross Lake." This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        Quesnel Lake is west of Ross Lake, not because the locations are at the same
        position. It explicitly states a directional difference ("Quesnel Lake is
        west of Ross Lake"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        the relative positions it analyzed.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Quesnel Lake is
        "significantly north and west of Ross Lake" and describes a clear directional
        difference between the locations
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Quesnel Lake is NOT located

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Quesnel Lake is west of Ross Lake, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Quesnel
        Lake is west (not east) of Ross Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b35905be-f966-4166-af0f-72e214c2f93e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Quesnel Lake was determined to be "significantly north and west of Ross Lake"
        - indicating a clear difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic comparison
        showing Quesnel Lake is northwest of Ross Lake.'

    e3dc84c2-05b7-4fca-ba2e-88ad8cb2e0f6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Quesnel Lake is west of Ross Lake, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two lakes. The answer is definitive and matches the format "NO, Quesnel
        Lake is not located east of Ross Lake."

    e7da19d3-c6a0-459c-af3b-52a40bc2e477:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that "Quesnel Lake is
        actually west of Ross Lake" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a
        directional difference between the locations. The NO was based on a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the geographical
        positions it analyzed. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison
        directly.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Quesnel Lake is west of Ross Lake, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship (whether Quesnel Lake is east of Ross Lake). The model states
        "The answer is: NO" and explains that "Quesnel Lake is west of Ross Lake".'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        ("Quesnel Lake is west of Ross Lake, not east"), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result stating "Quesnel Lake is NOT located

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Loughborough
        Lake is actually west of Skaneateles Lake," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Skaneateles Lake is west of Loughborough Lake, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model is confident in its answer and provides specific directional
        reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Skaneateles Lake is "west of Loughborough Lake" and "NOT east of Loughborough
        Lake", indicating a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Skaneateles Lake
        is west of Loughborough Lake, not east).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (Skaneateles Lake is southwest of Loughborough
        Lake), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        Lake is southwest of Loughborough Lake, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states a directional difference between the locations, so this
        is not a case of equal values.

        also did not claim the locations had equal coordinates - it actually noted
        they had very different longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO (I cannot definitively say
        Barbee Lake is east of Mount Shinn)" which is explicitly stating it cannot

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have sufficient information
        to confirm the statement's truth)" which indicates it cannot determine the
        comparison. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot make
        the determination, so this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        it cannot confirm the relationship due to insufficient information. This is
        effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which meets our criteria for
        UNKNOWN. The model is not making a comparative determination but rather indicating
        inability to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d780c7f6-1bb2-490c-b480-35bde80f0640:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made a comparison
        of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations relative to each
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "I do not have enough information to determine this."
        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information
        about one of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the statement
        is true)" and explicitly indicates it cannot determine the relationship due
        to lack of information about Mount Mackenzie. This is a case where the model
        is stating it cannot make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal or unequal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the directional relationship
        due to insufficient information about Mount Mackenzie's location. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Birkenhead Lake is west of Tolkien Peak (indicating a
        difference in position), not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing
        Birkenhead Lake is west of Tolkien Peak, not east.

        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes
        a difference in relative position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
        clear comparative directional claim and provides a definitive NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Gorce Mountains
        are explicitly stated to be west/northwest of Morskie Oko, indicating a different
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        that Gorce Mountains are west/northwest of Morskie Oko.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Gorce Mountains being west of Morskie Oko), not because the locations are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Gorce Mountains
        are explicitly stated to be northwest of the region containing Morskie Oko,
        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Gorce Mountains are west of Morskie Oko, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about whether the Gorce Mountains are
        east of Morskie Oko. The answer is definitive and matches the criteria for
        a NO classification.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Nevada is west
        of Alberta, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because Snake Range
        is stated to be west of Lac la Nonne, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Snake Range is NOT east of Lac
        la Nonne. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Snake Range was determined to be west of Lac la Nonne (a directional difference),
        not east as presumably asked in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        the locations are different, with Snake Range being west of Lac la Nonne.
        The model does not state or suggest the locations are at equal longitude -
        it explicitly states they are "quite far apart" and in different relative
        positions.

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that Snake Range is west of Lac la Nonne. The NO is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as a final standalone answer. The model
        makes a clear comparative determination that Snake Range is west of Lac la
        Nonne, not east.

        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently confirm
        it is east of the lake)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        due to insufficient information about one location. This is effectively stating
        an inability to make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        being equal or the same - rather, it gives the NO answer due to insufficient
        evidence and inability to verify the relative positions. It never states or
        implies the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While it shows hesitation,
        it does make a definitive NO statement at the end rather than refusing to
        answer or leaving it ambiguous.

        a NO comparison or claimed the locations were equal - it simply couldn't verify
        one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and "does not have enough information to answer this question

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because it determined the English
        Channel is west of Whiteadder Water, not east ("Specifically, the English
        Channel is west of Whiteadder Water, not east"). This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear, direct NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states the English
        Channel is "to the SOUTH and WEST of Whiteadder Water" - indicating a different
        relative position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the English Channel
        is not located east of Whiteadder Water" as its final conclusion. This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because it determined
        the English Channel is west of Whiteadder Water, indicating a directional
        difference. The model explicitly states "The English Channel is actually west
        of Whiteadder Water, not east."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its determination that

        there is a directional difference, saying "Lake Vico is west of Pragser Wildsee."
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lake Vico is east of Pragser Wildsee. It provides
        a direct comparative result, stating that "Lake Vico is west of Pragser Wildsee."

        stating it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it "cannot confidently affirm" the relationship. This
        is effectively stating it cannot determine the relationship, making this a
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after stating
        it cannot confidently answer. However, this NO is explicitly given as a way
        to indicate uncertainty rather than as a comparative result. The model clearly
        states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question" and only gives
        NO as a forced choice to indicate uncertainty. This makes it a case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO is given because the model "cannot
        confirm the east positioning." This is a case of uncertainty about the relative
        positions, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty earlier. While it shows hesitation, it ultimately
        commits to a NO answer rather than refusing to answer or leaving it ambiguous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8dafebad-39ea-45dd-86b1-b75c00c26792:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is because it "cannot prove" or "verify" the relative positioning.
        This makes it a case of being unable to determine rather than a comparative
        result, which classifies as UNKNOWN per the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e736ab51-097a-4bf0-aca8-353fc973a284:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about the locations being equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" and explains that it lacks sufficient confidence
        to make the comparison due to uncertainty about Knoll Lake's location. This
        is a clear refusal to make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but indicates this
        is due to inability to determine the relative positions ("I cannot confidently
        determine" and "cannot definitively say"). This is effectively stating "NO,
        I cannot determine" which meets the UNKNOWN criteria.

    f20a2b23-66db-4e7c-b222-afb55abc64f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Borith
        Lake is west of Shankaracharya Temple (a directional difference), not because
        the locations have equal coordinates. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference ("Borith Lake would actually be west of Shankaracharya
        Temple, not east").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Borith Lake
        is west of the temple, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based
        on the direction being opposite to what was asked (west instead of east),
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional reason (Borith
        Lake being west, not east, of the temple)

        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to inability to confirm one location. This is a case where the

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about Lake Lashaway's
        location. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer.

        one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the premise
        of the question)" which indicates it cannot make the comparison because it
        cannot verify one of the locations. This is a case where the model rejects
        the premises of the question, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative
        answer.

        verify their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot verify" or "definitively
        state" the relationship, but ends with "NO". Since it explicitly indicates
        it cannot determine the relationship, this falls under the UNKNOWN category
        per the criteria, despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer YES or NO to this question due to insufficient
        information" because it cannot locate one of the locations being compared.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have enough verified

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Cordillera Vilcanota is west of the White Mountains, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the eastern position
        of Cordillera Vilcanota relative to the White Mountains.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Cordillera
        Vilcanota is "west of the White Mountains" and "located much further west."
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Cordillera Vilcanota is located east of White Mountains.
        The answer is direct and comparative.

    70cff576-cf8e-48af-a46e-faaff4423751:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (specifically that Cordillera Vilcanota is "significantly
        west" of the White Mountains), not because they are equal or the same. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis showing Cordillera Vilcanota is west (not east) of the White Mountains.

        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model's reasoning
        was about non-existence rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        that "the question cannot be answered with a definitive YES or NO" and indicates
        one of the locations doesn't exist. Per the instructions, when a model rejects
        the premises of the question (e.g., "NO, but one of these doesn't exist"),
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Victoria is west of Lake Abaya (a directional difference), not because the
        locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        ("Lake Victoria is located to the west of Lake Abaya, not to the east")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions, and this NO is a comparative result

        not cite equality of values as a reason for its response - it instead rejected
        the premise due to the non-existence of one of the water bodies.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating "Queen Victoria
        Sea" doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. While it does say "NO" at
        the end, this is clearly a case where the model is indicating it cannot make
        the comparison due to one location not existing. Per the instructions, when

        states that one of the water bodies doesn't exist ("no body of water called
        'Queen Victoria Sea'") and that "the question cannot be answered." When a
        model rejects the premises by stating one of the compared items doesn't exist,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and rejects the premise
        because one of the locations (Queen Victoria Sea) doesn't exist. When a model

        in coordinates and rejected the premise due to non-existence of one water
        body.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating there is
        no "Queen Victoria Sea" and therefore the comparison cannot be made. Although
        it ends with "NO", this is a case where the model is rejecting the premises
        of the question since one of the water bodies doesn't exist. Per the instructions,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" as its final answer, it
        explicitly states that one of the locations (Queen Victoria Sea) does not
        exist. According to the classification rules, when a model rejects the premises
        of the question by stating one of the elements doesn't exist, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "South Mountain is further west than Round Lake" and "Round Lake is
        located east of South Mountain". The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether South Mountain is east of Round Lake. The model provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that "South Mountain is west of Round Lake"), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates there is a difference
        in position, with one being west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it described them as being
        in different positions (one "further east" and one "further west"), even though
        its final conclusion contradicted its analysis. The NO was not based on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (South Mountain
        is NOT east of Round Lake)" which directly contradicts its previous statement
        "Therefore, South Mountain is EAST of Round Lake". Despite this contradiction,
        the model gives a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly indicates
        they are in different positions (Wales vs. Scottish Highlands) and the NO
        is based on their relative positions being different, not equal.

        are "on completely different continents, separated by thousands of miles"
        and used this geographical separation as the basis for its NO answer, not
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in its conclusion statement "The answer is NO" and as a final standalone
        "NO" at the end. The model provides a direct comparative answer rather than
        refusing or indicating inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or the same position. Instead, it says they are "very different
        geographical locations" and that "it doesn't make sense to discuss their east-west
        relationship." The NO answer is based on the statement that "Quidi Vidi Lake
        is not east of the Pensacola Mountains" rather than on any equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, even

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are "very different geographical
        locations" and that one is "much further west" than the other. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a directional reasoning that Quidi Vidi Lake is "much further west"
        than the Pensacola Mountains, making it explicitly NOT east of them.'

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Quidi Vidi
        Lake is "significantly west" of the Pensacola Mountains, indicating a clear
        difference in position rather than equality.

        is "somewhat arbitrary" and questions the meaningfulness of the comparison,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates
        that the comparison is problematic due to extreme separation and hemispheric
        differences. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." While it discusses complexity in determining east/west relationships,
        it provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating

        complex due to the hemispheric differences, it does not state that the locations
        are at the same longitude or have equal positions. Instead, it indicates they
        are on opposite sides of the planet and provides this as reasoning for the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Eastman Lake is west of Alkali Lake), which
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Eastman Lake
        is west of Alkali Lake, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the values were equal - it instead stated that one of
        the locations wasn't in Oregon at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question (stating
        Eastman Lake is in California, not Oregon) and indicates the comparison cannot
        be made as stated. Although it provides "NO" at the end, this is a case where
        the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to invalid premises,
        making this an UNKNOWN classification.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the NO was given because "the
        lakes are not in the same location to establish an east/west relationship"
        and are in different states. This is a rejection of the comparison's validity
        rather than a statement of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after reasoning through the comparison, even though it initially expresses

        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that Eastman Lake is west of Alkali
        Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions. The
        NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (west instead
        of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative location question, providing it as a direct
        answer without any caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.

        It explicitly states a directional difference ("west of"), so this is not
        a case of equal values.

        the Atlantic Ocean surrounds Mount Belinda rather than being exclusively east
        of it. This is a difference in relative positioning, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        the model determined the Akaishi Mountains are on the opposite side of the
        world and cannot be east of Gulf St Vincent due to their relative positions.
        The model explicitly notes they are "on opposite sides of the world" and that

        equality. The NO appears to be an error given these statements, but we must
        evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, and this is clearly presented as a comparative directional result,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Upper
        Klamath Lake is west of Lost Lake, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Upper
        Klamath Lake is actually west of Lost Lake"), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response about
        the relative position (stating Upper Klamath Lake is west, not east, of Lost
        Lake).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states differences in their positions,
        noting that Hesaraghatta Lake is more to the northwest while Kodaikanal Lake
        is more to the southwest, and specifically states that "Kodaikanal Lake is
        actually east of Hesaraghatta Lake." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Hesaraghatta Lake is east of Kodaikanal Lake. The
        model makes a direct comparative statement and provides a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that "Hesaraghatta Lake
        is slightly north and west of Kodaikanal Lake" and bases its NO answer on
        this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about whether Hesaraghatta
        Lake is east of Kodaikanal Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hesaraghatta Lake is west
        of Kodaikanal Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Hesaraghatta Lake is located east of Kodaikanal Lake.
        This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined that Hesaraghatta Lake is specifically west of Kodaikanal
        Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model determined that since Hesaraghatta Lake is west of Kodaikanal
        Lake, it cannot be east of it.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Hesaraghatta
        Lake is west of Kodaikanal Lake, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Hesaraghatta Lake is east of Kodaikanal Lake. The

        Hesaraghatta Lake is west of Kodaikanal Lake, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
