      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it notes that they have "roughly similar longitudes"
        but then specifically states that "Putorana extends both west and east of
        Karbi Anglong's position" and "parts of Putorana extend farther east than
        Karbi Anglong." The model is indicating a difference in their positions (Putorana
        being larger and extending beyond Karbi Anglong), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are approximately equal or overlapping, and this equality/overlap is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that while they have "roughly similar longitudes,"
        the Putorana Plateau extends further east than Karbi Anglong, and Karbi Anglong
        is "slightly to the east of the western portions of Putorana, and slightly
        to the west of the eastern portions of Putorana." The model is noting differences
        in position, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        "the Sea of Marmara extends slightly further east than Witwatersrand's position"
        and that Witwatersrand is "slightly west of it." These statements indicate
        a small difference in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "the MacDonnell Ranges are NOT
        east of the Bungo Channel - they are at roughly the same longitude or slightly
        to the west." This indicates that the model is saying they are approximately
        equal in longitude (or the MacDonnell Ranges are slightly west), which is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, then reconsidered
        and gave another "NO" answer but with a different reasoning. The final answer
        is clearly "NO" to the question of whether the MacDonnell Ranges are east
        of the Bungo Channel.

        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "the MacDonnell Ranges
        are NOT east of the Bungo Channel, but rather west of it" and ends with a
        definitive "NO".

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer. However,
        this NO is followed by an explanation that indicates the model cannot confirm
        the comparison because it doesn't have definitive information about Mount
        Sembrano's location. The model is essentially saying it cannot determine the
        relative positions, which makes this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO to the comparison.

        Matano, not to the east." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        directly east) of Lake Matano. This indicates a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mount Sembrano is east of Lake Matano. The model

        a directional difference (slightly west), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Cross Lake (Shreveport)
        is not east of Sabine Lake." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Cross Lake (Shreveport,
        Louisiana) is not located east of Sabine Lake. It is located west of Sabine
        Lake." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        and south of Bear Lake," indicating a difference in their positions. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Knoll Lake is not

        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Harney Lake would be
        west of Lake Lahontan, not east, which is a clear negative response to the
        original question (which presumably asked if Harney Lake is east of Lake Lahontan).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Harney Lake is northwest of Lahontan Reservoir, which means it is not
        east of it. The model identified a directional difference (northwest vs. east),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Harney Lake is not east
        of Lahontan Reservoir because it determined that Harney Lake is northwest
        of Lahontan Reservoir.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while their east-west positioning
        is "quite similar" because they're both on the coast, the key difference is
        in their north-south relationship, with Port Stephens being north of Glenrock
        Lagoon rather than east of it. The model notes their positions are "quite
        similar" but not identical, and the reason for the NO is directional (north-south
        rather than east-west).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a potential difference, stating "parts
        of Glenrock Lagoon might be slightly more easterly on the coastline." This
        indicates the model believes there is a directional difference (even if slight)
        rather than equality, which is the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        as the reason for its NO answer. It indicates that the locations are approximately
        equal in terms of east-west positioning, which is why Port Stephens is not
        east of Glenrock Lagoon. The equality in longitude is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        further east into the Pacific Ocean than Glenrock Lagoon" but explains that
        the primary relationship is north-south rather than east-west. Since it acknowledges
        a difference in eastward positioning (even if described as slight), this is
        not a case of equal values.

        north of it along the same coastline" and even mentions "Port Stephens might
        be slightly more eastward than Glenrock Lagoon, but this difference would
        be minimal." This indicates a directional difference, not equality, as the
        reason for the NO answer.

        which indicates there might be some slight difference but it's not significant.
        The model is saying NO because the east-west difference is not meaningful,
        not because they are exactly equal.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (northwest vs east),
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Borith Lake is east of Shankaracharya Temple. The model provides

        the same longitude, with Cordillera Vilcanota possibly being slightly west
        of the White Mountains." The model notes a difference (Cordillera Vilcanota
        being "slightly west"), which means it's not claiming equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Loch Goil is located
        west of Sierra Blanca, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different
        positions relative to each other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Loch Goil is not located
        east of Sierra Blanca (Andalusia). It is located west of Sierra Blanca." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        Scotland is further west than Sierra Blanca in southern Spain" and "Loch Goil
        is NOT east of Sierra Blanca - it's actually west of it." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.

        of Sierra Blanca, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference (northwest vs east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Loch Goil cannot be
        east of Sierra Blanca, and instead states that Loch Goil is northwest of Sierra
        Blanca.

        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Lake Victoria (which

        Sea) is not located east of Lake Abaya. The model specifically states that
        Lake Victoria is "west of Lake Abaya, not east" and that the Victoria Sea/Weddell
        Sea is "far south" and "not meaningfully east or west" of Lake Abaya. The
        model is rejecting the directional relationship, not claiming the locations
        are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        (and south in one case) of Lake Senftenberg, not to the east. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Totes Gebirge is not east of Lake Senftenberg. The
        model concludes that Totes Gebirge would be west (not east) of Lake Senftenberg,
        regardless of which Lake Senftenberg is being referenced.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lillydale Lake is
        located to the northwest of Western Port, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Lillydale Lake is NOT
        located east of Western Port" and explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lillydale Lake is northeast
        of Western Port, and Western Port is southeast of Lillydale Lake (making Lillydale
        Lake northwest of Western Port). The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes with "Therefore, Lillydale Lake is NOT located east of
        Western Port. NO" which is a clear negative comparative result.

        Instead, it states that "the Sea of Galilee is located north and slightly
        west of the Dead Sea," indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
        The model is giving a NO answer because the direction is different (west rather
        than east) from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Sea of Galilee
        is not located east of the Dead Sea." This is a clear negative answer to the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Sea of Galilee is "north
        of the Dead Sea, within roughly the same north-south geographical corridor."
        The model is noting that they are in "approximately the same east-west alignment"
        but this is not stating they are equal in position - rather it's explaining
        why the answer is NO (because the relationship is north-south, not east-west).

        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in positioning, stating "the Sea
        of Galilee is slightly to the west of the Dead Sea, not to the east." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (slightly west vs. east), not
        equality.

        are equal. Instead, it explains that "the Sea of Galilee is north of the Dead
        Sea, and if anything, the Dead Sea is slightly east of the Sea of Galilee."
        The model notes a directional difference, indicating the Dead Sea is "slightly
        more eastward in some portions" compared to the Sea of Galilee. Since the
        model identifies a directional difference rather than equality as the reason
        for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Sea of Galilee is east of the Dead Sea. The answer is clear
        and definitive.

        of the Dead Sea, not east of it. While it mentions they are "roughly aligned
        in the same north-south corridor," this is not claiming they have equal east-west
        positions, and the primary reason for the NO answer is directional difference
        (north vs. east), not equality.

        north-south than east-west. Since it acknowledges a possible slight difference
        and doesn't claim exact equality as the primary reason for the NO answer,
        this is False.

        then in the conclusion saying "the Akaishi Mountains being slightly west or
        approximately at the same longitude". This inconsistency aside, the model
        indicates there is some difference (either slightly east or slightly west),
        not that they are exactly equal. The model's reasoning for NO is based on
        directional comparison, not equality.

        where one entity (the lake) is contained within the other (the range), not
        that they are equal or identical. The reason for the NO answer is that the
        relationship is more complex than simple eastward positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        Lake, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer. While it does provide additional context about the Caspian Sea spanning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Beaufort Range is positioned
        northeast of Sproat Lake" and "it cannot be east of Sproat Lake (it's more
        to the north than directly east)." The model is noting a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Beaufort Range is not
        east of Sproat Lake, but rather northeast of it.

        of the Khentii Mountains' longitude range" and that "they overlap in their
        east-west positioning." This indicates a partial overlap rather than exact
        equality, and the model notes differences in their ranges (the Java Sea extends
        beyond the Khentii Mountains in both directions).

        being compared are the same or equal. Instead, it states that the Java Sea
        is not entirely east of the Khentii Mountains, with parts of it being directly
        south or southwest. The model notes that they overlap somewhat in longitude,
        but the reason for the NO is that the Java Sea is not positioned entirely
        to the east of the Khentii Mountains, not that they have identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that the Java Sea is not
        located east of the Khentii Mountains because "the Java Sea is not entirely
        east of the Khentii Mountains (parts of it are directly south or even southwest)."

        the Khentii Mountains - they are roughly at similar longitudes" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model is indicating that the values (longitudinal positions)
        are approximately equal or similar, and this equality is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer. The model specifically notes they are "roughly at
        similar longitudes" and does not identify any directional difference between
        them.

        south of the Khentii Mountains" and only "partially overlaps or extends slightly
        eastward in terms of longitude." The model is noting a directional difference
        (south rather than east) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of
        position.

        Mountains' range" and "they overlap in longitude." The model is indicating
        there is an overlap rather than equality, and it's specifically noting differences
        in the positioning (the Java Sea extends beyond the Khentii Mountains in both
        directions).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "the Java Sea is not

        that the Bay of Bengal spans across longitudes both east and west of Lake
        Pyasino, not that they are at exactly the same location. The reason for the
        NO is that the Bay as a whole cannot be considered east of Lake Pyasino because
        parts of it are not east of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Eau d'Heure lakes are
        west of Djurdjura" and therefore answers "NO" to what appears to be a question
        about whether Eau d'Heure lakes are east of Djurdjura.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    689ec7cb-9f2d-4c92-9e1f-3e7424829b30:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states "Belgium is slightly to the east
        of the Djurdjura range in Algeria, the Eau d'Heure lakes would be located
        slightly east of Djurdjura." The model identifies a difference in position
        (slightly east), which is the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Eau d'Heure lakes are west of Djurdjura, not east. The model explicitly
        states "Eau d'Heure lakes are NOT east of Djurdjura; they are west of Djurdjura."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Eau d'Heure lakes are east of Djurdjura. The model
        explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining that Eau d'Heure lakes are
        west of Djurdjura, not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Belgium is west
        of Algeria" and concludes that "Eau d'Heure lakes must be west of Djurdjura
        (not east)." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs.
        east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        Eau d'Heure lakes are east of Djurdjura.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f58f8473-1b1b-4c3a-bf12-6e3980eda997:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Eau d'Heure lakes being west of Djurdjura, not east. The model
        says "Belgium is significantly west of Algeria's position" and concludes that
        "Eau d'Heure lakes are NOT east of Djurdjura; they are west of Djurdjura."
        This indicates a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model explicitly concludes that "Eau d'Heure
        lakes are NOT east of Djurdjura; they are west of Djurdjura" and ends with
        "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fb2ee0e6-d8e0-4339-848b-8c5caf19826a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with Eau d'Heure lakes being west of Djurdjura, not east.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Eau d'Heure lakes in
        Belgium are located west of Djurdjura in Algeria, not east" and then explicitly
        provides "NO" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Lake Annecy is located
        east of Lysefjord" as its final answer. This is a clear affirmative response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. Instead, it notes they are at "roughly similar longitudes" but then
        specifically states that "Lysefjord extends across a range that might be slightly
        east of Lake Annecy's position." This indicates a potential difference in
        position, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake Annecy is east of Lysefjord. This is a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" in
        its final step (Step 4) after comparing the east-west positions of Lake Annecy
        and Lysefjord. The model clearly provides a definitive YES answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states "Lake Annecy is slightly to the east of Lysefjord"
        after noting they are "roughly at similar longitudes." The model identifies
        a directional difference (even if slight) rather than equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the original
        question.

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded that Lake
        Annecy is east of Lysefjord.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized
        an error in its reasoning and corrected its answer to "YES" at the end of
        its response. The final explicit answer provided was "YES."
