      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same longitude or equally positioned east-west. Instead, it suggests they
        should be considered in terms of north-south alignment rather than east-west,
        and bases its NO answer on their relative positions across the U.S.-Canada
        border. The model does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Skaneateles Lake
        is "likely southeast of Loughborough Lake" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. Even though this is part of a compound direction (southeast),
        any directional difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Skaneateles Lake is located east of Loughborough Lake would be NO".
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, noting
        that Skaneateles Lake is "more to the south" rather than directly east of
        Loughborough Lake. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical relationship
        between the two lakes.'

    7a7e7ca3-774a-47e0-9f41-7d8d547966aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Skaneateles
        Lake is southwest of Loughborough Lake, not because the locations are equal/same.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after analyzing the locations and determining that
        Skaneateles Lake is southwest (not east) of Loughborough Lake.

        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Skaneateles Lake is west of Loughborough Lake, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the geographical positions, concluding that Skaneateles Lake
        is west of (not east of) Loughborough Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are vastly
        distant and that "moving east from Antarctica does not directly lead to Indiana."
        The model's reasoning is based on relative positions and directions, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Barbee Lake "cannot be directly east
        of Mount Shinn due to the geographical layout of the continents and the Earth's
        curvature." The NO answer is based on their different geographical positions
        and relationships, not because they are at the same location or coordinates.

    747d402a-a0f5-4b35-864f-a4afef73935f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because Barbee Lake is "north and slightly
        west" of Mount Shinn, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the answer is NO because
        of the complexity of comparing east-west directions across hemispheres and
        continents, and because Barbee Lake "cannot be directly east of Mount Shinn
        due to their positions on the globe." The model notes differences in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response after explaining its reasoning. While the explanation includes

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on opposite
        sides of the globe and that their east-west relationship depends on specific
        longitudes (which aren't provided). The model suggests that conventional east-west
        comparisons don't apply well due to the locations being in different hemispheres,
        but never states the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While
        the model discusses complexity and uncertainty, it ultimately provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.'

        rather than any claim of equality between the positions. Since the final answer
        was NO but equality was not given as the reason, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it spends considerable time discussing limitations and uncertainties.
        Since it does provide this clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude/position. Instead, it gives a different reason for the
        NO answer - that Mount Iwaki is north of Lake Inawashiro rather than east
        of it. The model indicates there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that Mount Iwaki is not east of Lake
        Inawashiro (stating it is north instead).

        "Atlin Lake is generally north and slightly east of Teslin Lake," indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, providing a clear comparative result based on
        its geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's reasoning is somewhat complex, it
        does not state that the lakes are at the same longitude or in the same position.
        Instead, it discusses their relative positions in terms of borders and terrain,
        suggesting they are in different positions. The NO answer appears to be based
        on their relative geographic positions, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Teslin Lake is located east of Atlin Lake is: NO." This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same location or have equal positions. Instead, it indicates that Atlin Lake
        is "generally west of Teslin Lake," showing there is a difference in their
        positions. The NO answer appears to be because the premise of Teslin Lake
        being east of Atlin Lake is incorrect (since Atlin Lake is west of Teslin
        Lake), not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Snake
        Range to be "southwest of Lac la Nonne" and "not east but rather southwest
        or west of Lac la Nonne." The NO was based on finding a directional difference
        (southwest vs east), not because the locations were determined to be equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis determining
        that Snake Range is southwest/west of Lac la Nonne rather than east.'

        similar longitudes\" and are \"roughly at the same longitude,\" it also mentions\
        \ they are \"slightly different, depending on the exact locations.\" The model\
        \ gives specific longitudes showing Snake Range at \"114\xB0 to 115\xB0 W\"\
        \ and Lac la Nonne at \"around 114\xB0 W.\" Since the model indicates there\
        \ are slight differences rather than stating they are exactly equal, and this\
        \ slight difference is part of the reasoning, this does not qualify as a NO\
        \ due to exact equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Snake Range is located east of Lac la Nonne would be NO" as its final conclusion.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        the Snake Range is located east of Lac la Nonne would be YES" in its conclusion.
        While there is some uncertainty in the analysis, the model provides a clear
        YES answer.

    efb84ac8-22ec-4a0d-950a-428aa306d545:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it arrives at NO due to lack of evidence supporting
        the eastern position and through process of elimination. The model discusses
        uncertainty about exact locations but does not base its NO answer on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty in its

    f035bfff-7f87-4b66-ba44-8e698f14d77c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Snake Range is
        west of Lac la Nonne, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO is based on Snake Range being in a different direction
        (west) than what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the geographic
        relationship between the two locations. The answer is definitive and based
        on the model's geographic analysis.

    f07e7ae0-d6aa-4d7e-9c31-b486e4acf043:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information to
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it heavily
        qualifies this answer by noting it lacks specific coordinates and information
        needed to make the comparison, and admits the answer involves speculation.
        This indicates it cannot actually determine the relationship, making this
        effectively a statement of inability to verify rather than a comparative result.

        in fact, it explicitly stated Snake Range is west of Lac la Nonne, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was given because Snake Range was
        determined to be west (not east) of Lac la Nonne.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Snake
        Range is west of Lac la Nonne, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference ("Snake Range is west of Lac la
        Nonne") as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, determining that Snake Range is
        west of Lac la Nonne (not east).

        locations, it never states that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it indicates it cannot determine the precise relative positions but still
        concludes with NO. The NO is not based on the locations being equal, but rather
        on insufficient information to confirm an eastward relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides a
        clear NO as the comparative result, we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN,
        despite the model's expressed uncertainty.

        where Lago di Saoseo is located, is generally west of Lake Iseo"). The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        Heart Lake, indicating a directional difference (even if described as "generally").
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        different positions (one more southwest, one more north) but expresses uncertainty
        about exact locations. The NO answer appears to be based on the model's reasoning
        that Professor's Lake is likely west rather than east of Heart Lake, not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model

        that Hulun Lake is northeast while Daming Lake is southeast. The NO answer
        is given because the north-south axis is described as more relevant than the
        east-west axis, not because the locations are equal.

        Hagg Lake would be west (not east) of the mountains, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO is based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the reference
        point (North Shore Mountains). Since it provides a definitive NO rather than

        (Paravur Lake is southeast of Tilyar Lake). The difference in position, even
        though part of it is eastward, leads to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing a clear directional reasoning for why Paravur
        Lake cannot be east of Tilyar Lake (stating it is southeast instead).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the NO answer was given because
        Lillydale Lake was determined to be northwest of Western Port, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in terms of their east-west positioning. Instead, it explains
        that the Sea of Galilee is "to the north and somewhat east of the Jordan River"
        while the Dead Sea "extends to the east." The NO answer appears to be based
        on their relative positions being different, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the Sea of Galilee is located east of the Dead Sea. The
        answer is clearly stated and is a direct comparative result.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with the Sea of Galilee being "northwest" relative to the Dead
        Sea. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the geographical positions. The answer is clearly stated
        and is a direct comparative response to the question.

        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that the Sea of Galilee
        is "west or northwest of the Dead Sea" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the Sea of Galilee is east of the Dead Sea. This is
        a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, saying the Sea of Galilee is "west or slightly
        northwest" of the Dead Sea. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the Sea of Galilee is east of the Dead Sea. The model
        actually indicates the Sea of Galilee is "west or slightly northwest" of the
        Dead Sea.

        Even though this difference might be small, any stated directional difference
        means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (southeast vs east), not on equal values. It explicitly states that Cloudy

        southeast of Lake Kaiiwi" and uses this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. Since it identifies a directional difference (even if slight),
        this is not a case of equal values.

        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        positions, suggesting Lake Kaiiwi is likely west of Cloudy Bay due to Cloudy
        Bay's eastern coastal position. The NO is based on geographical differences,
        not equality.

        directly east of Paco Volcano in terms of a straight line from Paco Volcano
        towards the east; rather, Lake Mainit is north of Paco Volcano"). The NO answer

        rather than because of equality between the locations. Since the final answer
        was NO but equality was not stated as the reason, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about having enough information throughout
        its reasoning. Since it provides this definitive NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or stating it cannot determine, we must classify this as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions. This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a specific directional difference, noting that
        Eau d'Heure lakes are "north and slightly east" from Djurdjura. Even though
        it concluded NO, this was based on the primary movement being northward rather
        than eastward, not because the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. The answer was clearly
        stated and was not a refusal or inability to determine.

    4c813352-cdb1-40b4-a8a1-8786fb745dd6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Eau d'Heure lakes are
        "generally north or northwest of the Djurdjura mountain range" - indicating
        a difference in position, which is the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in bold at the end of its response, making a direct comparative
        judgment about the geographic relationship between the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a clear directional difference (Belgium being
        west of Algeria). The model never suggested the locations were at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis
        showing that Eau d''Heure lakes are west of Djurdjura (and thus cannot be
        east of it).'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is not relevant
        since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, making this a clear YES answer despite acknowledging some complexity
        in the relationship.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Belgium being northwest of Algeria), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        making this a comparison of unequal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions.

    dc331b1c-ccd5-4065-80f2-9f66c6577b49:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because Algeria (where
        Djurdjura is) is "south and slightly east of Belgium" and that the "primary
        direction... is south rather than east." This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Eau d''Heure lakes are
        not directly east of Djurdjura.'

    dcc070a2-a11a-4f2a-81bd-fb314d9ef8fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different positions, concluding
        that Eau d'Heure lakes are "northwest or more specifically west of Djurdjura."
        Since it gives directional differences as the reason for the NO answer rather
        than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        in a definitive way, making this an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.'

    faa475b1-3505-4db8-a734-c1f32c813c05:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, it concluded NO because the
        Eau d'Heure lakes are "not directly east of Djurdjura but rather are located
        more to the north." The model indicates there is a directional difference
        (being more northward), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a comparative result based on geographical analysis,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Lake Annecy being southwest of Lysefjord. The NO answer is given because
        Lake Annecy is determined to be southwest (not east) of Lysefjord.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the locations, providing a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Lake Annecy is "south and slightly west of Lysefjord" - indicating a difference
        in position, even if slight. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion of its analysis and as the
        final statement. This is a direct comparative answer to the question of whether
        Lake Annecy is east of Lysefjord.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Annecy is west of Lysefjord, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Lake Annecy
        is west of Lysefjord") and does not claim the locations are at equal longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions of both locations
        and determining that Lake Annecy is west of Lysefjord, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Lake Annecy is south/southwest of Lysefjord, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was given because Lake Annecy
        is in a different direction (south/southwest) than what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the geographical positions of Lake Annecy and
