        and east of Funtensee, with its western edge being west of Funtensee and its
        eastern parts extending further east. The model also notes that the predominant
        directional relationship is south, not east. The NO answer is based on geographical
        differences, not equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that the Queen Victoria Sea is not located east of Lake
        Abaya, primarily because it doesn't believe there is a body of water called

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lillydale Lake is
        northwest of Western Port, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        sits northwest of Western Port, not east of it" and "the eastern shores of
        Western Port extend further east than Lilydale Lake's position." The model
        does not state that the values being compared are the same or equal; rather,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that Lillydale Lake is not east of Western
        Port because "While Lillydale Lake might be east of the westernmost parts
        of Western Port, it is not east of Western Port as a whole" and "Parts of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that Lillydale Lake is not east of Western
        Port because the easternmost parts of Western Port extend further east than
        Lilydale. The model specifically states "The easternmost parts of Western
        Port actually extend further east than Lilydale" and explains that from Western
        Port, "you would need to travel north and west (not east) to reach Lillydale
        Lake." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        of Western Port, and that "Western Port's easternmost points extend further
        east than Lilydale's location." The model is indicating a difference in position
        (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer.

        are the same. Instead, it explains that Lillydale Lake is north-northeast
        of Western Port, not directly east of it. The model is noting a directional
        difference (north-northeast vs. east) as the reason for its NO answer, not
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lillydale Lake located east of Western Port?" The model

        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that the Sea of Galilee is not located east of the Dead Sea. This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explains that the Akaishi
        Mountains range from "slightly west to slightly east of Gulf St Vincent" and
        are "primarily at the same longitude or slightly west." The model notes there
        is some overlap and variation in the longitudinal positions, not that they
        are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Akaishi Mountains located east of Gulf St Vincent?" The
        answer is clear and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that the
        Akaishi Mountains fall within the same longitudinal span as the Gulf St Vincent,
        not because they are exactly equal. The model states "the Akaishi Mountains
        fall entirely within the longitudinal span of the Gulf St Vincent" and explains
        that they "occupy a portion of the same longitudinal range." The model is
        noting an overlap rather than equality, which is why it concludes they cannot
        be considered east of the Gulf.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
        "Is Akaishi Mountains located east of Gulf St Vincent?" with "NO" after comparing
        the longitudes of both locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that the two locations
        are at approximately the same longitude. It states "Both locations sit at
        approximately the same longitude" and "they are at approximately the same
        longitude." The model explicitly gives equality of position as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The answer is presented in a dedicated "Answer: NO" section at the end of

        in Japan are at similar longitude or slightly west of Gulf St Vincent, not
        east of it." The model indicates there is a directional difference (slightly
        west), even if small, rather than claiming the locations are identical or
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that the
        Java Sea and Khentii Mountains occupy roughly the same longitudinal range
        with significant overlap, not that they are exactly equal. The model states
        "the Java Sea is not positioned clearly to the east of the Khentii Mountains
        but instead occupies roughly the same longitudinal range" and notes that "their
        central positions are at very similar longitudes." The model acknowledges
        some differences (eastern portions of Java Sea extending beyond Khentii Mountains)
        but concludes they are at similar positions, not identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
        "Is Java Sea located east of Khentii Mountains?" with "NO" after analyzing
        the longitudes of both locations.

        equal. Instead, it explains that "they occupy roughly similar longitudinal
        positions" and that there is "significant overlap" between their longitudes.
        The model notes that "the eastern portion of the Java Sea extends slightly
        further east than the Khentii Mountains." This indicates a difference in values,
        even if there is overlap. The primary reason for the NO answer is that the
        Java Sea is "primarily south of the mountains, not east of them," not that
        they are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
