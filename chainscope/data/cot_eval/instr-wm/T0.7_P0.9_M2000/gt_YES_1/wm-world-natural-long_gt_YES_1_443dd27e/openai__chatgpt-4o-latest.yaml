        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Mount Iwaki is to the
        northwest of Lake Inawashiro, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude
        or latitude values, but rather that their relative positions don't support
        the "east of" relationship asked in the question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates a directional difference, stating
        that "the Gorce Mountains are generally to the northwest of Morskie Oko."
        This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Snake Range is southwest of Lac la Nonne, which means it cannot be
        east of Lac la Nonne. The model explicitly states "Snake Range is situated
        to the southwest of Lac la Nonne" and "Since Snake Range is southwest of Lac
        la Nonne, it is not located to the east of Lac la Nonne." The model is noting
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that it has determined the Snake Range is

        Lac la Nonne" based on their relative geographic positions (Snake Range in
        Nevada, western US; Lac la Nonne in Alberta, Canada, which is east of Nevada).
        The NO answer appears to be based on directional difference, not equality.

        farther east than Snake Range" and "Snake Range is west of Lac la Nonne,"
        indicating a difference in their positions. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

        a clear geographical difference in position (west vs. east), not equality.
        The NO answer appears to be in response to a question asking if Snake Range
        is east of Lac la Nonne (since the model concludes it's west).

        difference (west vs. east), not equality. The reasoning shows the model believes
        Snake Range is west of Lac la Nonne, which is a difference in position, not
        equality.

        as the justification for saying NO to whether Snake Range is east of Lac la
        Nonne.

        "Paravur Lake is not east of Tilyar Lake; they are roughly aligned or Paravur
        is slightly west." The model suggests either rough alignment OR that Paravur
        is slightly west, not that they are exactly at the same longitude. Since it
        mentions a potential difference ("slightly west"), this does not qualify as
        claiming the values are equal as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of Mount Victoria and Mount Lefroy.
        The model concludes that "Mount Lefroy is positioned slightly to the east
        and south of Mount Victoria" and therefore "it is correct to say Mount Lefroy
        is east of Mount Victoria."

        is located northwest of Siri Lake" and "the Gulf of Ob is west or northwest
        of Siri Lake." The model is clearly indicating a directional difference (west/northwest)
        as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of positions.

        "far to the northwest of Siri Lake" and is "much farther west of Siri Lake."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.

        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a NO
        answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that "Without a definitive
        global reference for Siri Lake, I cannot confidently determine the relative
        positions." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one of the locations.

        answer. Instead, it states "Since the location of Siri Lake is unclear, I

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Gulf of Ob is west,
        not east, of Siri Lake" - indicating a directional difference rather than
        equality. The model is stating that the locations have different relative
        positions (one is west of the other), not that they are at the same location
        or have equal coordinates.

        The model is identifying a directional difference (slightly west rather than

        of what was being asked (whether the La Plata Mountains are east of Jackfish
        Lake). The model explicitly states "the La Plata Mountains are west (not east)
        of Jackfish Lake" as the reason for its NO answer.

        of Jackfish Lake. This indicates a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" in its
        final step. It directly answers the question with an explicit NO, indicating

        to be because the model determined that one location is west of the other,
        not because they have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the
