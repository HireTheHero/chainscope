    234ac9b2-664e-4de2-afe0-d3214a45e35f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different runtimes (65
        vs 75 minutes) and concluded NO because the first film was shorter than the
        second. The NO was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the runtimes and finding that Kid Gorgeous (65 min) is
        not longer than Dot in Space (75 min). This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it found that "Dot in Space" (75 minutes)
        is actually longer than "Kid Gorgeous" (65 minutes). The values are different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the runtimes and finding that "Kid Gorgeous" (65 min)
        is not longer than "Dot in Space" (75 min). This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        runtimes (189 vs 190 minutes) and indicates that one is shorter than the other.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is NO" after determining that Laawaris (189 minutes) is shorter than
        Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady (190 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (189 minutes vs 200 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, rather than stating the runtimes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different runtimes (189
        vs 191 minutes) and concluded NO because the first film was actually shorter
        than the second film. The NO was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the runtimes and finding that Laawaris (189 minutes) is
        not longer than Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady (191 minutes). This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the films are exactly
        equal in length. Instead, it notes that "Bunny Hugged" is "7 to 8 minutes"
        while "Bunny" is "approximately 7 minutes" and says "Bunny Hugged" could be
        slightly longer. The NO answer appears to be based on lack of definitive evidence
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with "Bunny Hugged" is not definitively longer than "Bunny" as its conclusion.
        This is a clear NO comparative answer.

        they are about the same length" and uses this as the primary reason for its
        NO answer. The model explicitly indicates they fall within "a similar range"
        and doesn't note any differences between their lengths, instead emphasizing
        their similarity as the basis for the negative comparison.

        the same length," it explicitly states that "Tall in the Trap" is "often slightly
        longer" and gives different approximate ranges (7 minutes vs 7-8 minutes).
        Since it indicates a difference in length, even if slight, this is not a case
        where the NO answer was given because the values are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'Devil's

        there might be slight differences ("Devil's Feud Cake" at 7 minutes vs "Tall

        The NO answer appears to be given precisely because they are considered to
        be the same length, making this a case where equality is the primary reason
        for the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different runtimes
        (110 minutes vs 252 minutes) and the NO answer is based on one being shorter
        than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result between the two movies'
        runtimes. The answer is definitive and based on specific runtime values provided.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the runtimes are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes different runtimes (110 minutes vs 252 minutes)
        and states that "L'Amour fou" is "significantly longer" than "Eiffel I'm in
        Love". The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when evaluating if "Eiffel I'm in Love" is longer than "L'Amour fou". The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states they are different (110 minutes vs 252 minutes)
        and concludes that one is shorter than the other. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different runtime values
        (110 minutes vs 252 minutes) and says NO because one is shorter than the other,
        not because they are equal. The values are explicitly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing if "Eiffel I'm in Love" is longer than "L'Amour fou", providing

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different runtimes (86 minutes vs
        175 minutes) and indicates Sharknado is shorter than The Godfather. The NO
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and determining that Sharknado is shorter than

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 86 minutes is less
        than 175 minutes, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was
        given because Sharknado is shorter than The Godfather, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" after
        comparing the runtimes and finding Sharknado to be shorter than The Godfather.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the runtimes are
        different (86 minutes vs 175 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one
        value is less than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the runtimes of the two movies, making this a

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the runtimes were
        different (86 minutes vs 175 minutes) and the NO was because Sharknado was
        shorter than The Godfather.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and finding that Sharknado (86 minutes) is shorter

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that "The Godfather" (175
        minutes) is "significantly longer" than "Sharknado" (86 minutes). The NO answer
        was due to this difference in length, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" after
        comparing the runtimes and finding that The Godfather is longer than Sharknado
        (not the other way around). This is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because 86 minutes
        is less than 175 minutes, not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a difference in runtime between the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'Sharknado' is not

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Sharknado is shorter
        than The Godfather, showing different values (86 vs 175 minutes) and a clear
        difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and determining that Sharknado (86 minutes) is

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both shorts have "similar runtimes"
        falling within "the same range of 6 to 7 minutes" and concludes NO based on
        there not being "a significant difference in their lengths". However, it does
        not explicitly state they are exactly/approximately equal as the primary reason
        for the NO answer. The use of "similar" and "same range" implies possible
        variation within that range rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both cartoons have "similar
        runtimes, generally around 6 to 7 minutes" and concludes NO because "neither
        short is significantly longer than the other." While this implies similarity,
        it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly/approximately equal as the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The ranges given (6 to 7 minutes) actually allow

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 171 minutes is less
        than 175 minutes, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was
        given because one value was smaller than the other, not because they were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the runtimes and finding that Shola Aur Shabnam (171 minutes)

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot confidently say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to lack of precise

        explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical/the same, and uses hedging
        language like "about" and "similar." The NO appears to be based on lack of
        significant difference rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'There They
        Go-Go-Go!' is not longer than 'Chow Hound.'" This is a clear NO answer to

        minutes vs 6 minutes). The NO answer is given because one is shorter than
        the other, not because they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both cartoons are "approximately
        7 minutes" long and explicitly uses this equality as the reason for the NO
        answer, saying "Since both... are around 7 minutes long, neither is longer
        than the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" to
        whether Cheese Chasers is longer than Knight-mare Hare, providing a clear
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different runtimes (6:39 vs 6:55)
        and concludes that "Knight-mare Hare" is longer than "Cheese Chasers". The
        NO is based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'Cheese Chasers'
        is not longer than 'Knight-mare Hare'" as its final comparative conclusion,
        providing specific runtime values to support this answer.

        as the reason for its NO answer. The equality of their lengths (both "around
        7 to 8 minutes") is the primary basis for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Knight-mare Hare
        (6:56) is longer than Cheese Chasers (6:48), showing a clear difference in
        runtime values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Cheese Chasers" is longer than "Knight-mare Hare". The model provides
        specific runtimes and makes a direct comparison, concluding that Knight-mare
        Hare is longer.

        as the reason for the NO answer regarding the original version comparison.
        While it does note a difference with the re-release version, the primary comparison
        and NO answer are based on the equal lengths of the original versions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO, Gone Nutty: Scrat''s
        Missing Adventure is not longer than the original version of Knick Knack"
        as its comparative conclusion.'

    dad592e0-2eb9-4762-ab07-5ac851bb0014:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films have "approximately
        the same runtime of 4 minutes" and concludes "neither is longer than the other
        in any significant way." This equality is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" after
        determining both films have the same runtime.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    f8b6d958-c1cd-4010-bfca-75a7d6c71468:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both films have
        the same runtime of approximately 4 minutes" and uses this equality as the
        primary reason for its NO answer ("Therefore, neither is longer than the other").
        This is a clear case where the NO answer is based on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the lengths, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films are "approximately
        4 minutes long" and concludes NO specifically because they have "roughly the
        same runtime." The equality of the runtimes is explicitly given as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the runtimes.'
