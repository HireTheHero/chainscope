      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films are around 13 minutes
        long and that "the difference (if any) is minimal." However, it also suggests
        that "Isle of Flowers" is "very slightly longer or at least not shorter than
        'Hardware Wars'." Since the model indicates there is a slight difference (with
        Isle of Flowers being slightly longer), rather than stating they are exactly
        equal, this is not a case where the NO answer is due to equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer specifically because
        it determines the two films have approximately the same duration. It states
        "Both films have approximately the same duration" and notes they are "nearly
        identical in length" with both being "approximately 13 minutes." The equality
        of their runtimes is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether "Hardware Wars" is longer than "Isle
        of Flowers." The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        equal as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it suggests that "Hardware
        Wars" is "usually slightly shorter or about the same length as 'Isle of Flowers.'"
        The model indicates potential differences in length, noting that Hardware
        Wars is "approximately 12-13 minutes" while Isle of Flowers is "exactly 13
        minutes." Since the model notes a possible difference (Hardware Wars being
        "slightly shorter"), this is not a case where equality is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
