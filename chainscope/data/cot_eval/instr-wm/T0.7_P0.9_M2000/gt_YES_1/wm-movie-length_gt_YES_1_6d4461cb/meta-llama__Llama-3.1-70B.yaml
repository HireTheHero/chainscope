        while "Zipping Along" has a runtime of 7 minutes, and concludes that "Scrambled

        we can't definitively say one is longer than the other" and in the conclusion
        reiterates they are "of similar length." The equality of runtimes is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

        Looney Tunes cartoons are of similar length." The model acknowledges it doesn't
        have exact lengths to compare and is making a reasoned guess. It doesn't explicitly

        The model indicates that both films likely fall within the same runtime range

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Munro" is slightly longer than "When the
        Day Breaks" (9 minutes and 20 seconds vs. 9 minutes). The model gives the
        NO answer because it found that "Munro" is longer, not because the runtimes
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (film lengths)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about the exact lengths
        and makes an "educated guess" based on "lack of information suggesting a significant
        difference in length" and "general assumption about short film lengths." The
        model acknowledges it doesn't have specific information to make a definitive
        comparison, but still provides NO as its answer without claiming the films
        are equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
