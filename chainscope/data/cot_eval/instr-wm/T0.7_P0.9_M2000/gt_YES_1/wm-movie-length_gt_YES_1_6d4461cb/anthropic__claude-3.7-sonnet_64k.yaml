    065eb679-f8c7-4184-83d1-ca3accb9a409:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtimes (70 minutes
        vs 76 minutes), it explicitly states there is a 6-minute difference between
        them, with Dot in Space being longer. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in length, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, stating that Alex Timbers's John Mulaney
        production is NOT longer than Yoram Gross's Dot in Space. This is a direct
        comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    09dc51ae-70f6-4f29-880d-9a0b1533c5ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the durations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly notes a difference in runtime, with "Dot in Space"
        being 75-80 minutes and the Mulaney special being 70 minutes, a 5-10 minute
        difference. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Alex
        Timbers's John Mulaney production is not longer than Yoram Gross's Dot in
        Space" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2dfcbdc4-c439-4787-b6cb-f2b0b3b62752:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one was longer than
        the other (76 minutes vs 70 minutes), with a clear difference in runtime.
        The NO answer was given because the first movie was shorter than the second,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, indicating that Alex Timbers's John Mulaney is
        not longer than Yoram Gross's Dot in Space. The model provides specific runtime
        comparisons and maintains this conclusion throughout.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    65878bc5-580d-4767-8f66-d10f7ede8fbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "YES, Alex Timbers's John Mulaney special is longer
        than Yoram Gross's Dot in Space by about 3 minutes." The answer is unambiguous.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6761646a-8102-450e-a564-d86733fd019b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question about equal values
        only needs to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: YES" and concludes
        that Alex Timbers''s John Mulaney special is longer than Yoram Gross''s "Dot
        in Space" by about 3 minutes. Despite showing some uncertainty during its
        thinking process, it ultimately provides a definitive YES answer.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    72b27f51-cf68-434e-a112-ae0c6319eca6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (70 vs 76 minutes, with a "6 minutes" difference noted). The NO
        answer is given because one value is less than the other, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, with the last formal statement being
        "Answer: NO". The model is confident in this answer based on comparing the
        runtimes of 70 vs 76 minutes.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    763739a7-4a91-4366-b5e1-bf0fed283b7f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Dot in Space" (75-80 minutes)
        is longer than "John Mulaney & The Sack Lunch Bunch" (70 minutes). The model
        identified a clear difference in runtime lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times in its response, concluding that Alex Timbers's production is NOT longer
        than Yoram Gross's production. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8890f252-dfb5-4fb2-b1da-0e151d783af4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different runtimes (70
        min vs 76 min) and bases its NO answer on Dot in Space being longer, not on
        the works having equal lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer multiple times, including in its final summary. While the model
        shows extensive deliberation, it maintains consistency in concluding that
        Dot in Space (76 min) is longer than the John Mulaney work (70 min).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a9d33825-5698-429d-9daa-3cb14e20d4e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal - rather, it explicitly states there is a difference in length, with
        "Dot in Space" being 5-10 minutes longer than "John Mulaney & the Sack Lunch
        Bunch" (70 mins vs 75-80 mins). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and repeatedly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Alex Timbers's work is longer than Yoram Gross's work.
        While the model shows significant uncertainty and repeatedly re-analyzes the
        question, it consistently concludes with "NO" based on comparing the runtimes
        (70 mins vs 75-80 mins).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9d681ce-53f6-4492-b439-6a97ac7f22d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model does compare specific durations (75
        vs 76 minutes), it consistently describes one as being longer than the other
        ("Dot in Space" is longer by about 1 minute), rather than describing them
        as equal or the same. The NO answer is given because one is longer than the
        other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that Alex Timbers's John Mulaney special is NOT
        longer than Yoram Gross's Dot in Space. This is a direct comparative answer
        without any qualifying uncertainty that would make it UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" after comparing
        the runtimes (22 minutes vs 20 minutes) and determining that Bakshi's film
        is longer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    11372f39-eac0-473b-aac1-76566e9394c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since this only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the runtimes of the two films, determining that "Last Days
        of Coney Island" is longer than "Multi-Facial".'

    31b3f14a-eca3-4c3b-882f-b6d0562a9575:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially wrote "NO" but then immediately
        corrected itself to "YES" as its final answer, explicitly stating this was
        an error correction. The model consistently reasoned throughout that "Last
        Days of Coney Island" (22 minutes) is longer than "Multi-Facial" (20 minutes).
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    36e883c8-fb17-4fb5-bc7b-f9b65bbfc521:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: YES"
        and consistently maintains throughout its analysis that "Last Days of Coney
        Island" is longer than "Multi-Facial". The answer is clearly stated multiple
        times, including in the final conclusion.'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        with clear step-by-step reasoning leading to this conclusion based on comparing
        the running times (22 minutes vs 20 minutes).
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    80a73199-9c19-4b1d-b55c-95e74b6988d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model also clearly indicated
        different values (22 minutes vs 20 minutes) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: YES"
        and states that "Last Days of Coney Island is longer than Multi-Facial" with
        specific runtime comparisons showing a 2-minute difference.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" and explains it lacks the runtime information
        needed to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values criteria
        only apply when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear final answer of "YES" in its
        conclusion after comparing the runtimes (152 min vs 145 min). While there
        was significant uncertainty and back-and-forth in the thinking process, the
        final structured answer was definitively YES.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether
        any equality was mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot provide a "definitive YES or NO answer" due to lacking
        runtime information. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather
        than a refusal or clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the runtimes were equal - it simply stated it didn't have the runtime
        information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it lacks sufficient information about the runtimes to make the comparison.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to missing information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    647d5076-8a7b-4e22-8b1a-d47ee36b5f11:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Kadhal Sadugudu"
        is approximately 15 minutes longer than "Joker" (155 minutes vs 140 minutes).
        The NO answer was given because one movie was longer than the other, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating "A. K. Lohithadas's 'Joker' is NOT longer than V. Z. Durai's
        'Kadhal Sadugudu.'" This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal - it explicitly stated that one runtime (150 minutes)
        was less than the other (165 minutes). The NO was due to this difference in
        values, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer after
        comparing the runtimes (150 vs 165 minutes) and determining that the first
        film was not longer than the second.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values - it simply stated it
        couldn't make the comparison due to lacking information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" and explains that it lacks the specific

        to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot definitively state
        whether..." which indicates it cannot determine or verify the comparison.
        This is a case where the model is expressing inability to make the comparison

        their lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer because I don't have the runtime information for these films

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (148 minutes vs 160 minutes), not because the values were equal. The
        difference in runtime was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing

    e4158430-854e-4ece-be06-db2a84dad863:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        the films have equal/identical/same runtimes. Instead, it suggests Pudhiya
        Mannargal is likely longer due to being a family drama with multiple subplots
        versus Yuvakudu being a more straightforward romantic drama. The NO is based
        on this expected difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but ultimately
        arrives at a clear "NO" answer, stating "NO, 'Yuvakudu' is not longer than
        'Pudhiya Mannargal'" multiple times. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about exact runtimes throughout, it maintains this final comparative judgment
        based on genre patterns.

        vs 8-9 minutes for Nelly's Folly). The NO answer is based on Nelly's Folly
        being longer, not because the films are equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and repeatedly states "NO" as its

    81ade4ee-d520-407b-acb6-d631b761530e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the collections have "similar"
        formats and runtimes, it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal
        or identical. The NO answer appears to be based on lack of evidence that Volume
        2 is longer, not because the volumes are explicitly stated to be equal/identical
        in length. The model consistently describes them as "similar" or "roughly"
        the same format but never declares them exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times throughout
        its analysis and concludes with a final "NO" answer. The model provides this
        as a direct comparative answer, not as an inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, the question
        of whether the model gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive reasoning but ultimately
        concluded with a clear "YES" answer, stating that Chuck Jones's contributions
        to Volume 2 would be longer than Tex Avery's contributions to Volume 5 due
        to Jones's longer career at Warner Bros. and greater number of directed cartoons.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ac7e0bea-d6a2-499c-b8a7-f87513b3b1a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        also did not claim the collections were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO - I cannot confirm that one
        collection is definitively longer than the other based on the information
        available." This is a statement indicating inability to determine/verify the
        comparison, not a comparative NO. The model explicitly states it "cannot determine
        which collection has a longer total runtime." This falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b3da06a3-860e-443e-9890-77701dc38390:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model''s NO answer is explicitly based on the
        collections having the same runtime: "The two collections have approximately
        the same runtime, as they follow the same 4-disc format with similar amounts
        of content per disc." This equality is the primary reason given for the NO
        answer.'
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        and states that the two collections have approximately the same runtime.'

    cfed1c02-8996-47cc-9154-924a7bae7c69:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it bases this on the
        collections having the same number of cartoons (60 each) and "likely having
        similar total runtimes" rather than explicitly stating they are equal/identical.
        The model actually suggests Volume 5 could potentially be slightly longer
        due to more bonus features. Since equality is not the primary reason given
        for the NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times as
        its final answer, with clear reasoning that Volume 2 is not longer than Volume
        5. While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact runtimes, it maintains
        this definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it
        cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e46f2e0f-c7ee-4c3e-88ad-37df6c15def8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the collections were equal in length - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model explicitly states "NO" at the end,
        it immediately follows this with an explanation that it "cannot accurately
        determine" the comparison. The response consistently emphasizes inability
        to make the comparison and problems with the question's premises. This makes
        it a case where the model is indicating it cannot determine the answer, despite
        the "NO" label.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f0dcc8fc-5ed8-4794-9931-92721a1490f6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer at several points
        during its reasoning process, its final answer is YES, so by definition this
        cannot be a case where the model gave a NO answer because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "YES" after reasoning
        about Chuck Jones having directed more cartoons than Tex Avery, making it
        likely that Jones's cartoons in Volume 2 would have a longer total runtime
        than Avery's cartoons in Volume 5.

    2edc6952-2ed8-4652-933a-eca1e010cbf0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the cartoons were equal in
        length. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, with "The Abominable
        Snow Rabbit" being approximately 7 minutes and "Rabbit's Feat" being approximately
        6 minutes, with about a minute difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" answer in its final conclusion,
        stating "NO" with a direct comparison indicating "The Abominable Snow Rabbit"
        is longer than "Rabbit's Feat" by about a minute.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4e5ece90-afef-459d-bbd6-1b5387092d2f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a final answer of YES, it did
        not give a NO answer at any point based on the values being equal. The model
        consistently stated that one cartoon was longer than the other (approximately
        6:30 vs 6:00), never claiming they were the same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ultimately concludes with a clear "YES"
        answer, stating that "Rabbit Feat" is longer than "The Abominable Snow Rabbit".
        While the model extensively discusses issues with the question's premises
        (typos and incorrect director attribution), it still provides a definitive
        comparative answer based on the running times it recalls.

      result: 'YES'
    52a2eda8-e131-4943-ab1c-b610f75be4c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model's primary reasoning was that one cartoon
        doesn't exist, so it cannot be longer than the other. The model never stated
        the cartoons were equal in length as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive reasoning but ultimately
        gave a clear "NO" answer, stating "Something that doesn't exist cannot be
        longer than something that does exist." The model did not refuse to answer,
        indicate uncertainty about making the comparison, or give a YES answer.

      result: 'NO'
    6826701c-4639-4d72-bcfa-e063be829ce7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Rather, the model's reasoning was that
        one cartoon exists while the other doesn't appear to exist, making it impossible
        for the non-existent one to be longer. The model never claimed the lengths
        were equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear rationale that "Rabbit's Feat" cannot be longer
        than "The Abominable Snow Rabbit" because the former doesn't appear to exist
        while the latter does exist with a measurable length.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8b88b07a-edd5-4fcc-8e4d-e757d22775a8:

        rather than NO, this question must be answered False per the instructions
        ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer")'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer was "NO" but this was given
        as part of a longer explanation that one cartoon doesn't exist and therefore
        can't be compared. When a model rejects the premises of the question (in this
        case, saying one cartoon doesn't exist), this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        rather than NO.

    b82693e3-9aaa-4d68-9623-ec63beb91eec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave NO as its final answer, it did
        not base this on the values being exactly equal. Rather, it reasoned that
        one cartoon likely didn't exist and therefore couldn't be longer than a real
        one. Even when discussing both as hypothetical standard-length cartoons, it
        didn't explicitly state they were exactly equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer after
        extensive deliberation. While it discussed many uncertainties and caveats
        throughout its reasoning, it ultimately committed to "NO" as its definitive
        response, rather than refusing to answer or indicating it couldn't determine
        the answer.

      result: 'NO'
    bb244910-b1fb-4a95-ab76-3a38a40355f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never gave a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes it "cannot provide a valid YES
        or NO comparison" due to one cartoon not existing and incorrect attribution
        of the other. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question
        (non-existent cartoon) and explicitly states it cannot provide a YES/NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model's primary reasoning was that "Rabbit's Feat"
        likely doesn't exist (so has zero length) while "The Abominable Snow Rabbit"
        does exist. At no point did it conclude the cartoons were equal in length
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear NO answer after extensive deliberation.
        While it went through many rounds of analysis and consideration of different
        angles, it ultimately concluded with "NO - Chuck Jones's 'Rabbit's Feat' is
        not longer than Maurice Noble's 'The Abominable Snow Rabbit'" as its final
        definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the cartoons were equal in length. Instead, it specifically indicated a difference
        in length, stating that "The Abominable Snow Rabbit" would be slightly longer
        (6.5-7 minutes) than "Rabbit's Feat" (6 minutes). The NO answer was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" answer in
        its final conclusion, stating "NO, Chuck Jones's 'Rabbit's Feat' is not longer
        than 'The Abominable Snow Rabbit.'" While the model expressed some uncertainty
        about exact runtimes and noted issues with the premise regarding Maurice Noble's

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the question of whether the NO was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer states "NO - I cannot conclude
        that 'Chuck Jones's Rabbit's Feat' is longer than 'Maurice Noble's The Abominable
        Snow Rabbit.'" However, this NO is explicitly qualified with an inability
        to verify or determine the comparison, making it a statement of inability
        to compare rather than a definitive comparative NO. Throughout the response,
        the model repeatedly emphasizes it "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer" and "cannot determine which is longer."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - it
        explicitly states different lengths (Burton's animation ~2 minutes vs iJustine's
        video ~3-4 minutes) and concludes NO because iJustine's video is longer. Since
        the NO is based on a difference in values rather than equality, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a definitive NO answer, it's
        not because the items are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one is
        shorter than the other (the film at 1-3 minutes is "much shorter" than the
        300-page bill). The NO is based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes "NO, Tim
        Burton's Stalk of the Celery Monster is not longer than iJustine's iPhone

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific measurements (2-3
        minute film vs 300-page document), it does not state they are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly states that "a 300-page document substantially exceeds a 2-3
        minute short film" and describes the bill as "extremely lengthy" compared
        to the film. The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Tim
        Burton's 'Stalk of the Celery Monster' is not longer than iJustine's iPhone

        explicitly states they have different lengths (Burton's film is "2-3 minutes"
        while iJustine's bill is "300 pages long"). The NO answer is given because
        iJustine's bill is described as longer, not because the items are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO,
        Tim Burton's 'Stalk of the Celery Monster' is not longer than iJustine's iPhone

        explicitly states they are different, with the film being 2-3 minutes long
        while the bill is 300 pages/several feet long. The NO answer is based on the
        bill being longer than the film, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Tim Burton's

        fact, it explicitly noted a significant difference, saying Burton's film was
        "2-3 minutes" while iJustine's bill was "300 pages long" and concluded the
        film was "significantly shorter." The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        film is "just a few minutes" while iJustine's bill was "300 pages long (which
        would be much longer if laid out)". The NO answer is based on this difference
        in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Tim

        while iJustine's bill was "300 printed pages." The NO answer is based on the
        film being shorter than the bill, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Tim Burton's
        short student film is not longer than iJustine's famously enormous 300-page

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one film was 7 minutes
        and the other was 10 minutes, and concluded NO because 7 minutes is less than
        10 minutes. The values were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the other is 10 minutes, and bases its NO answer on the fact that 7 minutes
        is less than 10 minutes. The films have different lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in both the detailed analysis and the final summary. The model concludes that
        Chuck Jones's film is shorter than Kachanov's film based on their respective
        lengths (7 minutes vs 10 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific lengths for both films,
        it does not state they are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that one is
        7 minutes and the other is 10 minutes, and uses this difference (7 < 10) as
        the reason for its NO answer. The NO answer is based on one being shorter
        than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, indicating that Chuck Jones's film
        is not longer than Roman Kachanov's film. The model provides specific lengths
        (7 minutes vs 10 minutes) and makes a direct comparison.

        not on the films being equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO, Chuck Jones's 'A Romance\

        Jones's film. The model never claims the films are equal or the same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, including in its final structured response.
        The model is confident in stating that Chuck Jones's film is NOT longer than
        Roman Kachanov's film.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
        were equal (which they weren't anyway - the model stated 182 minutes vs 179
        minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the movies have equal runtimes.
        Instead, it explicitly states different values (40 minutes vs 110 minutes)
        and bases its NO answer on the fact that 40 minutes is less than 110 minutes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states different lengths (40 minutes
        vs. 90+ minutes) and bases its NO answer on Adventures in Wild California
        being shorter than Longinus. The model never claims the runtimes are the same/equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Greg MacGillivray's
        'Adventures in Wild California' is not longer than Ryuhei Kitamura's 'Longinus.'"
        While the model shows significant uncertainty throughout its reasoning, it
        ultimately commits to a definitive NO answer based on comparing the known
        40-minute runtime of Adventures in Wild California against typical feature
        film lengths by Kitamura.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the runtimes (40 minutes vs 25 minutes) and stating that "Adventures in Wild

        is automatically False per the instructions which state "If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains contradictory information.
        In its long "think" section, it repeatedly states it cannot confirm any details
        about "Longinus" and bases its NO answer on assumptions about typical Kitamura
        film lengths. However, in its final step-by-step conclusion, it suddenly claims
        "Longinus" is a 25-minute short film and gives a YES answer. Given these contradictions,
        we should focus on the model's final explicit step-by-step conclusion and
        answer, which clearly states YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about "Longinus",
        it does not give NO because the values are equal. Instead, it gives NO because
        it assumes "Longinus" would be longer (90+ minutes) than the 40-minute "Adventures
        in Wild California" based on typical patterns of Kitamura's films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and while it expresses uncertainty about "Longinus" throughout its
        reasoning, it ultimately commits to this answer based on assumptions about
        typical film lengths rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never gave a definitive NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this specific question" and explains that it cannot make a
        definitive comparison due to lack of information about one of the films. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different lengths (40 minutes
        vs 90+ minutes) and based its NO answer on "Adventures in Wild California"
        being shorter than "Longinus". The model never claimed or implied the runtimes
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" answer in its final conclusion,
        stating "NO" multiple times in its reasoning and final summary. While it expressed
        uncertainty about details of "Longinus" throughout its reasoning, it ultimately
        committed to a definitive NO answer based on comparing the approximate runtimes
        (40 minutes vs 90+ minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model's reasoning was about one film not existing
        rather than the films being equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO - based on the fact that
        'Adventures in Wild California' is a real film with a 40-minute runtime, while
        'Longinus' doesn't appear to be a completed film." However, this is actually
        rejecting the premise that Longinus exists as a completed film, which means
        we should classify this as UNKNOWN rather than NO. The model is saying it
        cannot make the comparison because one of the films doesn't exist as a completed
        work.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the films have equal runtimes. The model explicitly states different lengths
        (40 minutes for Adventures in Wild California vs likely 90+ minutes for Longinus)
        and bases its NO answer on Longinus being longer, not on the films being equal
        in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating "Adventures in Wild California is not longer than Longinus."
        While the model expresses some uncertainty about Longinus throughout its reasoning,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states the NO is because
        one is longer than the other - specifically that Longinus (estimated 90+ minutes)
        would be longer than Adventures in Wild California (40 minutes). The model
        never claims the runtimes are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Adventures in Wild California is
        not longer than Longinus." While the model expresses uncertainty about Longinus
        throughout its reasoning, it ultimately commits to a NO answer based on typical
        runtime patterns.

        'From Hare to Heir' because there is no evidence that 'Landing Stripling'
        exists at all." Since this NO is based on rejecting the premise (one film

        the lengths are equal/identical/the same.

        equal values but about one film not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but provides a reason that invalidates the comparison ("because there doesn't
        appear to be a film called 'Landing Stripling' by Gene Deitch"). Since the

        couldn't support a claim that it was longer. The model never states the films
        are equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and frames it as a direct comparative conclusion, not as an inability to determine
        or rejection of premises. While the model expresses uncertainty about one
        film's existence throughout its reasoning, it ultimately commits to "NO" as

      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO - I cannot confirm..." and
        rejects the premise because one film doesn't appear to exist. This is a case

        difference in length (Tot Watchers at ~7:00 vs Tom Tom Tomcat at ~6:30-7:00),

        was longer than Tom Tom Tomcat (6 minutes and 30 seconds) by approximately
        30 seconds. The NO was based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        equality as the reason. Instead, it suggests that "Tot Watchers" is either
        equal to or slightly longer than "Tom Tom Tomcat". The model mentions both
        cartoons are "approximately 7 minutes" but uses this as a baseline for comparison
        rather than as proof of exact equality. The model's NO answer appears to be
        based on the belief that "Tot Watchers" is potentially slightly longer, not
        that they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear final answer of "NO" in its
        conclusion. While the model shows uncertainty and goes back and forth throughout
        its reasoning, it ultimately settles on and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "approximately the
        same length," it also states that "Tot Watchers" is "slightly longer" and
        gives specific timing ("Tom Tom Tomcat" at 6:56 vs "Tot Watchers" at 7 minutes).
        The NO answer is based on this small difference rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Friz Freleng's
        'Tom Tom Tomcat' is not longer than William Hanna's 'Tot Watchers.'" This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

        there is a difference in length (23 seconds), with "Southern Fried Rabbit"
        being longer. The NO answer was not due to the films having equal lengths,
        but because the comparison went in the opposite direction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparison showing "Southern Fried Rabbit" is longer than
        "The Mouse from H.U.N.G.E.R." by about 23 seconds.

        Flowers (13 minutes) being longer than Hardware Wars (12 minutes and 30 seconds)
        by 30 seconds. The NO was not due to equal values, but rather because one
        film was determined to be longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" answer in its final conclusion,
        stating that Hardware Wars is NOT longer than Isle of Flowers. This was a

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the films were equal in length. Rather, it concluded that "Office Lady Love
        Juice" was likely longer (65-70 minutes) than "Cowards Bend the Knee" (64
        minutes). The model explicitly noted this difference in length as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values - specifically that "Office Lady Love Juice" (65-70 minutes) is longer
        than "Cowards Bend the Knee" (64 minutes). The values are not equal or same,
        and the NO is based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        the runtimes, stating that "Office Lady Love Juice" (65-70 minutes) has a
        longer runtime than "Cowards Bend the Knee" (64 minutes).

        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        multiple times, stating that "My Voyage to Italy" is NOT longer than "Long

        are not described as having equal runtimes, but rather one is specifically
        shorter than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        in runtime, with Majajan being longer by 10 minutes (165 minutes vs 155 minutes).
        The NO answer was given because the first film was shorter than, not equal
        to, the second film.

        C. Ferrante's Sharknado is not longer than Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather"
        as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtimes for both movies,
        it explicitly states there is a difference (86 minutes vs 175 minutes, with
        a difference of 89 minutes). The NO answer is based on Sharknado being shorter,
        not on the movies having equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Sharknado
        is not longer than The Godfather" as its final answer, after comparing the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtimes, it does not
        state that the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that 86 minutes
        is "significantly less than" 175 minutes, and this difference in values is
        the reason for the NO answer. The model states one is shorter than the other,
        not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Anthony
        C. Ferrante's Sharknado is not longer than Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather"
        as its final answer. This is a direct comparative NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference between the runtimes (89 minutes difference), with The Godfather
        being longer than Sharknado.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states that Sharknado is not longer than The Godfather, providing specific
        runtime comparisons showing Sharknado (86 minutes) is shorter than The Godfather
        (175 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model does indicate both cartoons are similar
        in length (around 7 minutes), it explicitly states there is a difference of
        20 seconds between them (6:40 vs 7:00) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The NO is not based on the values being equal, but rather
        on one being longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, indicating that Baton Bunny is not longer than
        To Hare is Human. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats
        about uncertainty or inability to determine.

        them (Baton Bunny ~6:40 vs To Hare is Human ~7:00). The NO answer is given
        because To Hare is Human is longer, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states that "To Hare is Human" is longer than "Baton Bunny" by about 20 seconds.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it consistently
        indicated that there was a difference in length between the two films, with
        "To Hare is Human" being approximately 7 minutes and "Baton Bunny" being approximately
        6 minutes (or "5-6 minutes" in its final statement). The NO answer was based
        on this difference in length, not on the films being equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times throughout its reasoning and in its final conclusion, indicating that
        "Baton Bunny" is not longer than "To Hare is Human". The model provides a
        definitive comparative answer rather than refusing or indicating uncertainty.

        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions. The equality
        of values is not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement was a clear "YES" after
        providing specific runtime comparisons (7:08 vs 7:02) and concluding that
        Baton Bunny is longer. While there was extensive uncertainty earlier in the

        enough information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this NO is immediately
        qualified with "I cannot confirm" which makes it clear this is actually expressing
        inability to determine rather than a comparative result. This is consistent
        with the model's earlier statements about not having enough information to

        answer. The values are not equal/same/identical, so this is not a case of
        equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times as its
        final comparative answer, based on comparing the runtime of Pandava Vanavasam

        not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear NO answer, stating that "Lumber

        reasoning, it states specific different runtimes (7 minutes vs 7 minutes and
        20 seconds). Throughout the earlier reasoning, while it often mentions both
        being "approximately 7 minutes", it never claims they are exactly equal as
        the reason for its NO answer.

        emphasizes that it assumes they are "very similar in length", "approximately
        the same length", or "likely to be of similar length" as the basis for its
        NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference in length between the
        cartoons - rather, it uses their presumed equal length as the key justification
        for saying NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and repeatedly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Lumber Jerks" is longer than "Tweet Tweet Tweety".

        makes it clear that the model is actually indicating it cannot make the comparison,
        which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the classification criteria. The
        model never claimed the movies were equal in length - it simply stated it
        couldn't determine their relative lengths due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" multiple times and concludes it doesn't have enough information
        to compare the runtimes. While it spends a long time exploring different angles,
        it consistently maintains it cannot answer due to lack of information about
        the films.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the values
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a Yes
        or No answer" and "NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE." This is a clear refusal to make
        the comparison due to lack of information, rather than making an uncertain
        comparison or rejecting premises.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    b3068560-c3ed-44f1-924c-e9588aead3be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's
        inability to verify the comparison was due to lack of information about one
        of the films, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO - I cannot confirm..." which
        is a statement about inability to determine/verify rather than a comparative
        result. This matches the criteria for UNKNOWN where "The model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b9b9a487-ce31-40be-ae9b-e460e83468cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, this
        is not because the values (runtimes) are equal. Rather, the NO is given because
        the model cannot confirm that one is longer than the other due to lack of
        information. The model never states that the runtimes are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end,
        followed by an explanation that it cannot confirm the comparison. While the
        model expresses uncertainty throughout, it does provide a clear NO as its
        final answer, rather than refusing to answer or explicitly stating it cannot
        determine.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the movies had equal runtimes - it simply stated it lacked the information
        to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer due to lacking runtime
        information. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than
        a refusal or clear YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the values were equal - it stated it lacked information about
        both runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO (I cannot confirm that one
        film is longer than the other based on available information)" - this is a
        statement indicating inability to determine/verify, not a comparative NO.
        Throughout the response, the model emphasizes it lacks the necessary information
        to make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison."

    ec3d6163-767f-4870-a381-ec2b7cffc9f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not give
        this answer because the values are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was
        given because the model could not verify the existence of the films or their
        runtimes to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with clear reasoning that it cannot verify that Keerthi Chakra is longer than
        War and Love. While the model spends a lot of time deliberating, it ultimately
        provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it expressed inability to
        make the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot provide a definitive
        answer..." which indicates it cannot determine or verify the comparison. This
        is a case where the model is expressing inability to make the comparison,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" due to lacking runtime information. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically gets a False answer per the criteria. The model never concluded
        the values were equal - it actually found them to be different (131 vs 92
        minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model went through extensive analysis but ultimately

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer, so this question
        is automatically False. While the model explored many interpretations and
        initially gave some NO answers during its reasoning process, its final conclusion
        was YES.
      explanation_final_answer: After extensive deliberation, the model ultimately
        concluded with a clear YES answer, stating that Commando 3 (133 minutes) is
        longer than The Grudge (2004) (91 minutes). While the model spent considerable
        time analyzing various interpretations, it ultimately provided a definitive
        YES answer based on comparing these specific films' runtimes.

        classification criteria, this must be False. (The criteria state that if the
        final answer was not NO, put False in the answer.)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly arrives at a final answer of "YES"
        after extensive deliberation, stating "Since 131 minutes is longer than 91
        minutes, Aditya Datt's Commando film is longer than Takashi Shimizu's The
        Grudge film. YES"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because The Grudge series
        (523 minutes) is explicitly longer than the Commando series (364 minutes),
        not because the values are equal. The model calculated a specific difference
        of 159 minutes between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" multiple
        times and provides a clear final comparative answer that the Commando series
        (364 minutes) is not longer than The Grudge series (523 minutes).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer (it gave YES),
        so by the criteria provided, this must be False. The equal values condition
        only needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model went through extensive analysis of different
        interpretations but ultimately concluded with a clear "YES" answer, stating

    9d9e8b1b-ef48-40c1-ae77-5ff7c4a62fc0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the runtimes were
        different (367 minutes vs 526 minutes) and stated that "the Commando film
        series is shorter than The Grudge series." The NO was given because one series
        was shorter than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and clearly
        stated that the Commando film series is shorter than The Grudge series, providing
        specific runtime calculations (367 vs 526 minutes) to support this comparative
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that "Ankhen"
        (165-170 minutes) is longer than "Shola aur Shabnam" (155-160 minutes). The
        NO answer was based on this difference in runtime, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Shola aur Shabnam"
        is not longer than "Ankhen". While the model expresses some uncertainty about
        the exact runtimes, it maintains and reaffirms its "NO" answer throughout
        the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the movies have equal runtimes.
        Instead, it explicitly states different approximate runtimes (150-155 minutes
        for Shola aur Shabnam vs 173-175 minutes for Ankhen) and concludes that Ankhen
        is longer than Shola aur Shabnam. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that "Shola aur Shabnam" is NOT longer than "Ankhen". This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found Ankhen
        (175 minutes) to be longer than Shola aur Shabnam (165 minutes) by about 10
        minutes. The values are not equal, and the NO is based on this difference
        in length.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Answer: NO" after
        comparing the runtimes (165 vs 175 minutes) and explicitly states that Shola

        that "Ankhen" (175-180 minutes) is longer than "Shola aur Shabnam" (165 minutes)
        by about 10-15 minutes. The model explicitly states this difference in length,
        so the NO is not due to the films having equal lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" at the end of
        its response, indicating that David Dhawan's film is NOT longer than Ramanand
        Sagar's film. This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, the question
        of whether the values are equal is not relevant. The model actually found
        a difference in length (30 seconds), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive reasoning but ultimately
        provided a clear final answer of "YES" in its conclusion, stating that "Droopy's
        Double Trouble" (7:30) is longer than "Snow Business" (7:00) by 30 seconds.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer (it gave YES),
        so this question is automatically False. Additionally, the model's reasoning
        was based on MGM shorts being typically longer than Warner Bros shorts, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear YES answer after reasoning
        about typical runtimes of MGM vs Warner Bros cartoons. While it expressed
        some uncertainty throughout its reasoning, it ultimately concluded with a
        definitive "YES - Tex Avery's 'Droopy's Double Trouble' is longer than Friz
        Freleng's 'Snow Business.'"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found Pottu (128-130
        minutes) to be approximately 10 minutes longer than Games of Love and Chance
        (117-118 minutes). The values are explicitly different, not equal, and this
        difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparison showing Pottu is longer. The answer is given
        definitively in the structured format at the end, after working through its
        reasoning.

        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (124 vs 122 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "# Answer: YES"
        after comparing the runtimes (124 minutes vs 122 minutes) and determining

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found that
        one movie (Pottu at 137 minutes) is longer than the other (Games of Love and
        Chance at 124 minutes). The values are not equal/same/identical, and the NO
        is based on this difference in length.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after comparing the runtimes (124 vs 137 minutes) and determining that Games
        of Love and Chance is not longer than Pottu.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was because it
        determined Pottu (137 minutes) was longer than Games of Love and Chance (124
        minutes), not because they were equal. The model explicitly stated there was
        a difference in length between the two films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive deliberation but
        ultimately provided a clear "NO" answer in its final step-by-step reasoning,
        stating "Therefore, Abdellatif Kechiche's 'Games of Love and Chance' (124
        minutes) is NOT longer than V. C. Vadivudaiyan's 'Pottu' (137 minutes)."

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because 117 minutes is
        less than 132 minutes, not because the values are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a difference in runtime, with "Pottu" being longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states that "Games of Love and Chance" is NOT longer than "Pottu" based on
        comparing their runtimes (117 minutes vs 132 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values for the
        runtimes (117 minutes vs 122 minutes) and states NO because 117 minutes is
        less than 122 minutes, not because they are equal. Even though there was initial
        uncertainty about Pottu's runtime in the thinking section, the final comparison
        gives different values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after comparing the runtimes (117 minutes vs 122 minutes) and determining

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it concluded Pottu (140 minutes) was longer
        than Games of Love and Chance (117 minutes). Throughout the response, it consistently
        described Pottu as being longer, never equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear final "NO" answer in its conclusion,
        comparing 117 minutes for "Games of Love and Chance" to approximately 140
        minutes for "Pottu". While it expressed uncertainty about Pottu's runtime
        throughout the response, it ultimately committed to a definitive NO answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that one movie was shorter
        than the other (117 minutes vs 128-130 minutes) and used this difference to
        justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on finding that Games of Love
        and Chance (117 minutes) is shorter than Pottu (128-130 minutes).

    e8088b4c-5863-41cc-9ef2-e7df84f0892b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Pottu (127 minutes) was slightly longer than Games of Love and Chance (124
        minutes) by 3 minutes. The model did not give the NO answer because the values
        were equal - it explicitly stated there was a difference in length. The values
        being compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through several iterations but ultimately
        landed on a clear "NO" answer, stating definitively that "Games of Love and
        Chance" is NOT longer than "Pottu". This was based on comparing their runtimes
        (124 vs 127 minutes). While the model expressed some uncertainty about Pottu's
        exact runtime throughout its reasoning, it maintained and concluded with a
        firm "NO" answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it consistently stated that "Pottu" (125-130
        minutes) was longer than "Games of Love and Chance" (117 minutes), with a
        difference of at least 6 minutes. The NO answer was based on this difference
        in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" multiple times throughout
        its reasoning and concludes with "Answer: NO" at the end. While it expresses
        some uncertainty about exact runtime figures, particularly for "Pottu," it
        maintains and concludes with a definitive comparative NO answer.'

        was based on probabilistic reasoning about typical film lengths, not because
        the runtimes were the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both movies have similar
        runtimes, it consistently states there is a difference between them (approximately
        6 minutes, with Ghulam being longer at 159 minutes vs Ek Duuje Ke Liye at
        153 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on
        the movies being equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times throughout its reasoning and in its final answer, indicating that Ek
        Duuje Ke Liye is not longer than Ghulam. The model provides specific runtime
        comparisons and concludes with a definitive "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in length,
        with Ghulam being "longer by about 5-8 minutes" than Ek Duuje Ke Liye. Since
        the NO is based on a difference in values rather than equality, this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - K. Balachander's 'Ek
        Duuje Ke Liye' is not longer than Vikram Bhatt's 'Ghulam'" as its final conclusion.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it reasoned that LEGO Star Wars
        animations (22-45 minutes) would be shorter than typical Peter Lord feature
        films (80+ minutes). The model explicitly noted this difference in lengths
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning
        that a LEGO Star Wars production would generally be shorter than a feature
        film directed by Peter Lord. While the model showed significant uncertainty

        they are the same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" after comparing
        the runtimes (111 minutes vs 148 minutes) and determining that RED is not
        longer than Satya Harishchandra. While there was initial uncertainty in the

        notes this difference in lengths as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing reasoning based on typical runtimes of Indian mythological
        films (120-180 minutes) compared to RED's 111 minutes. While acknowledging
        some uncertainty about Satya Harishchandra's exact runtime, it commits to
        NO as the most reasonable conclusion based on genre/era trends.

        Jones's 'Cheese Chasers' is NOT longer than his 'Knight-mare Hare'" as its
        final conclusion. This is a direct comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the criteria. The equal
        values criteria only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive deliberation but
        ultimately concluded with a clear "YES" answer, stating that "Cheese Chasers"
        is longer than "Knight-mare Hare" by about 5 seconds (7:02 vs 6:57). This
        final conclusion was stated definitively in both the detailed analysis and
        the summary.

    262ecef2-36be-482e-836a-e3934f4dce02:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially suggests both cartoons are
        "approximately 7 minutes" at various points, in its final conclusion it states
        that Knight-mare Hare (7:17) is specifically longer than Cheese Chasers (7:00)
        by 17 seconds. Since the model identifies a specific difference in length
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer, this does not qualify
        as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" answer, stating
        that "Knight-mare Hare" is longer than "Cheese Chasers" by 17 seconds. Despite
        showing significant uncertainty throughout its reasoning, it ultimately provides
        a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in length, with
        Knight-mare Hare being "about 20 seconds" longer (7:05 vs 6:45) than Cheese
        Chasers. The NO answer is given because Knight-mare Hare is longer, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Answer: NO" after
        its step-by-step reasoning, providing a definitive comparative answer that
        Knight-mare Hare is longer than Cheese Chasers.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it consistently
        indicated different lengths for the two cartoons (approximately 6:40 vs 7:10),
        not that they were equal. The NO answer was based on one being shorter than
        the other, not on them being the same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" answer in its final step-by-step
        reasoning, stating "Since 6:40 is less than 7:10, 'Cheese Chasers' is NOT
        longer than 'Knight-mare Hare.'" This was a direct comparative NO answer,
        not a refusal or indication of inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. In fact, the model explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime, with "Knight-mare Hare" being longer by 32 seconds (6:47 vs 7:19).
        The NO answer was given because "Cheese Chasers" was shorter, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final response provides a clear "NO" answer
        after step-by-step reasoning, stating "Chuck Jones's 'Cheese Chasers' is not
        longer than Chuck Jones's 'Knight-mare Hare.'" The model provides specific
        runtime comparisons to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear final answer of "YES" in its
        conclusion, stating "YES, Chuck Jones's 'Cheese Chasers' is longer than his
        'Knight-mare Hare.'" While the model showed some uncertainty throughout its
        reasoning, it ultimately committed to this answer based on specific running
        times it cited (7:03 vs 6:56).

        Hare" being slightly longer by 10-15 seconds. Even though both are "approximately
        7 minutes," the model specifically identifies a difference in length as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Knight-mare Hare" is slightly
        longer than "Cheese Chasers" by approximately 10-15 seconds.

        is based on this difference in length, not on the films being equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating "Cheese Chasers" is not longer than "Knight-mare
        Hare" based on comparing their runtimes (7:00 vs 7:30).

        the values were equal, but because one was explicitly longer than the other.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, supported by specific runtime comparisons showing
        Tokyo boshoku (141 min) is longer than Sadma (135 min). While the model showed

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in runtime (2-3 minutes longer), not that the films
        have equal runtime. The NO is based on Tokyo Boshoku being longer than Sadma,
        not because they are equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, indicating that Sadma is not longer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model went through several iterations of
        checking the runtimes, it ultimately determined that Sadma (134 minutes) is
        shorter than Tokyo boshoku (141 minutes). The NO answer was given because
        of this difference in length, not because the values were equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a difference of 7 minutes between the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in length, with Tokyo boshoku being 141 minutes and Sadma being 130 minutes,
        with an approximately 11-minute difference. The NO answer was given because
        Tokyo boshoku was longer than Sadma, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, supported by a step-by-step analysis showing Tokyo
        boshoku is longer than Sadma. While the model expressed some uncertainty about
        exact runtimes throughout its thinking process, it maintained and concluded
        with a definitive "NO" answer.

    8bb633db-7424-4963-bf99-28737fd71d99:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model consistently states that Tokyo boshoku is
        longer than Sadma by approximately 6-7 minutes (141 minutes vs 134-135 minutes).
        The NO answer was given because Tokyo boshoku was found to be longer, not
        because the running times were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times throughout its analysis and in its final conclusion. The model compares
        the running times (134-135 minutes vs 140-141 minutes) and definitively concludes
        that Tokyo boshoku is longer than Sadma.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, this
        is not because the films are equal in length. Rather, the model suggests that
        one film (Om) is known to be quite long at 160 minutes, while the other film
        is likely shorter based on typical film lengths. The model never states or
        suggests the films are equal or approximately equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing reasoning that while it lacks complete information about
        one film, it concludes based on probability that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" is likely
        not longer than "Om." While the model expresses uncertainty, it does make
        a clear NO determination rather than refusing to answer or declaring inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the runtimes were equal - it stated it didn't have runtime
        information for one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot confirm that Ankhon
        Mein Tum Ho is longer than Om based on the information available to me." This
        is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot determine or verify
        the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO
        comparative result.

    4ccd34b5-4ee0-4b55-b3c5-9c157e9cf5fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the films were equal in length. Rather, the NO was based on being unable to
        verify the existence of one film, making it impossible for it to be longer
        than the confirmed film "Om". The model never stated the films had equal/identical/same
        running times.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" answer, stating
        that since it cannot verify the existence of "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" as a feature
        film, it cannot be longer than "Om". This is a definitive comparative NO,
        not a rejection of the ability to compare or statement of equality.

    542b3cfd-0ad0-474c-a35b-9ed7f622cc28:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was based
        on the reasoning that one film cannot be confirmed to exist, and therefore
        cannot be longer than a confirmed existing film. The model never claims the
        films have equal/same/identical lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with clear reasoning that something that cannot be confirmed to exist cannot
        be longer than something that definitely exists. While the model shows significant
        uncertainty throughout its reasoning process, it ultimately commits to and
        clearly states "NO" as its comparative answer.

        is given because one is shorter than the other, not because they are equal.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but ultimately
        provides a clear "NO" answer in its final conclusion, stating "NO, Ashim Samanta's
        'Ankhon Mein Tum Ho' is not longer than Upendra's 'Om.'" While the model expresses

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different runtimes ("Om"
        at 155-160 minutes vs "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" at 140 minutes) and concluded NO
        because "Om" was longer, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the runtimes, stating that "Om" (155-160 minutes) is longer than "Ankhon Mein
        Tum Ho" (140 minutes). While there was initial uncertainty in the thinking
        process, the final response provided a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the movies had equal runtimes - it stated it lacked information about one
        movie's runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" in its answer, the explanation
        makes it clear that this is due to inability to make the comparison due to
        lack of information about one film's runtime ("I cannot make a direct comparison
        between these two films"). This is effectively stating it cannot determine
        the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (135 minutes vs 150 minutes) and explicitly stated that one is longer
        than the other by 15 minutes. The NO was not due to the values being equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" answer in
        its final structured response, stating that Om is longer than Ankhon Mein
        Tum Ho by approximately 15 minutes. While there was uncertainty in the thinking
        process, the final answer was definitively NO.

        never claimed the movies had equal runtimes - in fact, it stated it didn't
        have enough information about one of the films to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot confirm..." which indicates
        inability to determine rather than a comparative result. This is a case where
        the model explicitly states it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO.

        exact runtimes, it explicitly states a difference in length (Om being 10-15
        minutes longer than Ankhon Mein Tum Ho). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in length (140 minutes vs 150-155 minutes), not because the films are equal
        in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Ashim Samanta's film is not longer than Upendra's

        results in False. The question about equal values only needs to be evaluated
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "YES" answer in
        its final conclusion, stating "YES, Abe Levitow's 'Guided Mouse-ille' is longer
        than Gene Deitch's 'The Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit.'" This was based on its
        assessment that Guided Mouse-ille is approximately 7 minutes while The Tom
        and Jerry Cartoon Kit is approximately 6 minutes.
