      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states there is a difference in
        values (64 vs 75 minutes) and explicitly notes that one is "shorter than"
        the other. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and finding that one is shorter than the other
        (64 vs 75 minutes)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    31c71ab4-f94c-4e00-9641-cd14f6631c27:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly shows the values are different (64
        minutes vs 71 minutes) and states that "64 < 71, so Alex Timbers's work is
        shorter." The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO" after
        comparing the runtimes and determining that the Alex Timbers work is shorter
        than the Yoram Gross work.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3f34cb48-b913-4940-918e-31e8c8639cc6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 64 minutes is "less
        than" 75 minutes, showing a clear difference in values as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the runtimes (64 vs 75 minutes) and determining
        that one is less than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    576c2c50-4367-4ff3-8ce5-188889fdfcdf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in runtime (70 vs 75 minutes) and notes that one is
        "shorter than" the other. The NO is not based on equal values, but rather
        on a clear difference in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes, where it found that John Mulaney & the Sack
        Lunch Bunch (70 min) is shorter than Dot in Space (75 min).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6f44241b-db66-4d4d-b113-e4e1cb621020:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different
        (80 vs 75 minutes), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly stated "Final Answer: YES" after
        comparing the runtimes and determining that 80 minutes is greater than 75
        minutes.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model shows that the runtimes are different (64
        minutes vs 75 minutes) and explicitly states "64 < 75". The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final answer. This is a direct
        comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the runtimes are
        different (64 minutes vs 75 minutes) and notes that one is "shorter" than
        the other. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes, and this is a clear comparative result showing
        that one runtime is not greater than the other (in fact, it found the opposite)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9ccbb24d-d0ca-473a-bea6-99063b45a40e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in values (65 minutes vs 75 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer ("Since 65 minutes is shorter than 75 minutes"). The values
        are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the durations (65 minutes vs 75 minutes)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that one runtime is shorter
        than the other (64 vs 75 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. It does not claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the runtimes and finding that one is shorter
        than the other.

        they are equal. The values are clearly different and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and finding that Southern Fried Rabbit (7 minutes)

        longer" and uses this difference (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer.
        Any stated difference, even if small, means this is not an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that one film is shorter than the other (6 minutes vs 7 minutes), not that
        they are equal. The NO is based on a difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether The Mouse from H.U.N.G.E.R. is longer than Southern
        Fried Rabbit. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found a difference in
        the number of films (6 for Sijjin vs 4 released for Housefull), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states "Sijjin (6 films) is longer than
        Housefull (4 released, 5th upcoming)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer, making a clear comparative statement that Housefull is not
        longer than Sijjin.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Sijjin has 6 films
        while Housefull has 4 films, and gives this difference (not equality) as the
        reason for its NO answer. The values being compared are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the number of films in each franchise (4 vs 6), indicating

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (6 movies)
        was greater than the other (4-5 movies), saying "Since 6 is greater than 5,
        the Sijjin franchise is longer than Housefull".
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        concluding that Sijjin franchise (6 movies) is longer than Housefull franchise

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference (6 films
        vs 4 films) and this difference was the reason for the NO answer. The values
        being compared were clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the number of films in each franchise, where it determined
        that Sijjin (6 films) is longer than Housefull (4 films).

        one value was less than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and determining that Red (111 minutes) is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        runtimes (111/116 minutes vs 184 minutes) and explicitly states that both
        RED movies are "shorter than" Satya Harishchandra. The NO is not due to equal
        values, but due to one being shorter than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, stating that neither RED movie is longer than Satya Harishchandra.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparison question.

        in the runtimes (Red at 111 minutes and Red 2 at 116 minutes vs Satya Harishchandra
        at 206 minutes) and says they are "significantly shorter." The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model clearly states different runtimes (111 vs
        184 minutes) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" as its final answer,
        stating "NO, Dean Parisot's Red is not longer than Hunsur Krishnamurthy's
        Satya Harishchandra." However, since the model first notes that Dean Parisot's
        Red doesn't exist and proceeds with a different movie (Red 2010 by Schwentke),
        this constitutes rejecting the premises of the question, making the final
        answer UNKNOWN.

        less than 184 minutes, explicitly stating a difference in values. It did not
        give NO because the values were equal - in fact, it clearly showed they were
        different lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on comparing the runtimes (111 minutes vs 184 minutes).
        While it notes some uncertainty about which "Red" movie to use, it makes a
        definitive comparison using RED (2010) and provides a clear NO answer.
