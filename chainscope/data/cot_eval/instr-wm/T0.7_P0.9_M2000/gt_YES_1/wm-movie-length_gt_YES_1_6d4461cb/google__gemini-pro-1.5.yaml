      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows the runtimes are different
        (70 min vs 75 min) and uses the < symbol to indicate they are not equal. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes (70 min vs 75 min)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2a7bfee2-0214-441e-b1af-802b8a59f0db:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly shows
        the values are different (65 minutes vs 75 minutes) and indicates one is less
        than the other. The NO is not based on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, and this is given as a direct comparative result after showing
        that 65 minutes < 75 minutes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values are different (65
        minutes vs 75 minutes) and used this difference (< relationship) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after calculating that 65 minutes < 75 minutes. This is a clear negative
        response to whether John Mulaney is longer than Dot in Space.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        runtimes (130 min vs 148 min), not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        shows that one is less than the other (130 < 148)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly concludes
        that "Joker is not longer than Kadhal Sadugudu" after comparing the runtimes

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the runtimes were equal.
        Instead, it concluded that Tex Avery's Looney Tunes catalog is "significantly
        longer" than the Race series. The NO answer was based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one franchise
        is not longer than the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the franchises have equal
        lengths. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined that one franchise
        (Tex Avery Looney Tunes) is likely longer than the other (Race), stating "it's
        highly likely that the entire Tex Avery Looney Tunes output... is longer than
        the 'Race' franchise."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        answer after reasoning about the relative lengths of the franchises. While
        it expressed some uncertainty about exact runtimes, it provided a clear comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis, indicating that the Race franchise is longer
        than the Looney Tunes collection.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7ad81205-66d2-401f-9dd2-7599cf2cf795:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and indicates it lacks the information needed to make the comparison.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        the runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO without more information" and explains that it lacks the runtime data needed
        to make the comparison. This indicates an inability to determine the answer
        rather than a refusal to compare or a clear YES/NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    97a98925-63c8-4c27-8c88-6f1e4b15a85d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the runtimes were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined one was longer
        than the other, specifically stating that Tex Avery's Looney Tunes would have
        a greater total runtime due to the vast number of shorts compared to just
        three Race films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that the Race
        franchise is not longer than Tex Avery's Looney Tunes.

        say YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lacking
        runtime information. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        determine the answer.

        as reflecting "the lack of evidence for a significant length difference."
        The model's reasoning is about insufficient evidence rather than proven equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing a clear directional statement. While it expresses
        uncertainty in the analysis, it does make a definitive NO choice rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find one of the values to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the runtime comparison. This makes it
        a case of being unable to determine/verify rather than a definitive comparative
        NO, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        equal in length. Instead, it explicitly states that one is "likely much shorter"
        than the other. The NO appears to be given because the model confused which
        movie it was comparing, but regardless, it clearly indicates a difference
        in lengths rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, though it appears to have confused "Beast Wars II" with "Lio Convoy's
        Close Call" in its conclusion. Despite this confusion, it gives a clear NO
        answer to a comparative length question.

        not because they were equal. The values were explicitly stated to be different
        with "75 minutes < 85 minutes".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the answer is NO." This is a direct
        NO answer based on the comparison showing 75 minutes < 85 minutes.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give a definitive
        YES or NO" and indicates it needs more information to make the comparison.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a98b0445-11c2-484c-9b4d-1532de62f58b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the runtimes were equal anyway - it actually suggested they
        were likely different based on the number of movies.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "leaning towards a NO", it explicitly
        states it "can't definitively answer" due to lacking runtime data. The model
        only makes a probabilistic guess based on the number of movies, but acknowledges
        it cannot make a definitive comparison without the actual runtimes.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    dba611d4-90e3-4448-857d-a8e7fe186a5b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        runtime information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES/NO answer without that information" because it lacks access to the movie
        runtimes needed for comparison. This indicates an inability to make the comparison
        due to missing data.

        model explicitly notes a difference ("93 minutes... is less than 94 minutes")
        and does not state they are equal/same/identical. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the runtimes of the two movies (97 minutes vs 87 minutes)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the runtimes were equal - it stated it couldn't compare them
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the reasoning
        given indicates it cannot make the comparison because one of the movies cannot
        be specifically identified. This falls under the case where the model rejects
        the premises of the question ("NO, but one of these doesn't exist"), which
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the values were equal - it stated one movie doesn't exist so
        no comparison could be made.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because one of the movies doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible.
        According to the criteria, when a model rejects the premises by stating one
        item doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        lengths were equal - it stated one film doesn't exist for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one of the
        films doesn't exist as a feature film, making comparison impossible. While
        it does say "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting the
        ability to make the comparison rather than making a comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ca69cc32-5c65-49ea-908b-2cb24ce7cc8d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model''s reasoning for NO is based on the logic
        that "Will Vinton''s Will Vinton''s" is comparing something to itself (step
        3: "This is a comparison of the same thing to itself" and step 4: "A thing
        cannot be longer than itself"). While this implies equality, the NO answer
        is primarily based on logical impossibility rather than an explicit statement
        that the values are equal/identical/the same.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after reasoning about the comparison. This is a clear negative comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        never claimed the values were equal - it stated one of the items wasn't a
        valid movie for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but rejects the premise by saying
        "Will Vinton's" isn't a specific movie title and therefore can't be compared.
        When a model rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        fact, it explicitly noted that one film is "under 10 minutes" while the other
        is "over an hour" and concluded NO based on this difference in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states there is a significant difference ("a feature film
        is significantly longer than a 7-minute cartoon"). The NO answer appears to
        be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. While it discusses both items and mentions that short
        films are generally shorter than feature films, it never indicates equality
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it appears to be comparing different
        types of content (short film vs music video).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" making this a clear NO answer. While the reasoning is not entirely
        clear from the steps provided, there is an unambiguous final comparative answer.

        film) as the reason for its NO answer. The NO was based on an identified difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise by stating that one of the films (Romain Gavras's
        Born Free) doesn't exist. When a model rejects the premises of the question,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        vs 95 minutes) and used this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The values
        were not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer after
        comparing the lengths of the films (7 minutes vs 95 minutes), even though
        it noted some uncertainty about one of the films being referenced.

        was based on the animated short being longer, not on equal lengths
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one item

        never claimed the runtimes were equal - it stated it couldn't make the comparison
        because one film doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the films doesn't exist
        and therefore can't be compared, but still gives "NO" as its final answer.
        When a model rejects the premises by stating one item doesn't exist, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN regardless of the explicit "NO" given.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the runtimes were
        different (110 minutes vs 112 minutes) and used the less than symbol (<) to
        indicate this difference. The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with "Therefore, the answer is NO." This is an explicit NO answer
        based on the comparison showing that Love in the City (110 minutes) is less
        than Nakkash (112 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lengths are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one is "highly likely" shorter than the
        other. The NO answer is based on a perceived difference in lengths, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative judgment, making this a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the runtimes were equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicated that American Epic was "unlikely to exceed"
        the runtime of the Hera Pheri series, implying a difference in length. The
        NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing both works and their runtimes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it stated that one film doesn't exist making comparison impossible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains that one film doesn't exist making comparison impossible,
        it still provides this as a definitive NO rather than refusing to answer.
        Since it rejects the premise by stating one film doesn't exist, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN despite the explicit "NO".
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, the reason given was that one film doesn't
        exist and therefore can't be longer than the other. The model never stated
        the lengths were equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning (non-existent film can't be longer
        than an existing film), making this a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model's reasoning was
        about existence rather than equal values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one of the
        films doesn't exist ("Octomom Home Alone likely doesn't exist"), making comparison
        impossible. While it does say "NO" at the end, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria where "the model rejects the premises of the question."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model didn't give a
        NO answer based on equal values - it actually indicated the comparison was
        impossible because one film doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one of the
        films doesn't exist ("Octomom Home Alone likely doesn't exist"), making it
        impossible to make the comparison. While it does say "NO" at the end, this
        is a case where the model is rejecting the ability to make the comparison
        rather than making a comparative judgment.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model didn't compare
        equal values - it stated one film doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one film
        doesn't exist and therefore cannot be compared. While it ends with "NO", this
        is a case where the model is saying the comparison is impossible rather than
        making a comparative judgment.

    6ddb3f0d-a82e-48de-bdf3-c92bab73399c:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        - it actually stated that a comparison was impossible because one film doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one movie doesn't exist, making
        a comparison impossible, and then gives "NO" as an answer. Since the model
        rejects the premise by stating one movie doesn't exist, this falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      result: UNKNOWN
    7f8c3fb1-6a83-4c22-805a-df93d65dedc1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the values were equal. Instead, it stated that one movie is fictional (thus
        has no length) while the other is real, making a comparison impossible. This
        is a difference-based reason, not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (stating that one cannot be longer
        than the other), not as an inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    93aeb52d-1f0c-41f9-b9a8-375efad9495d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        according to the rules, this must be False. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the values were equal - it stated one movie doesn't exist so no comparison
        is possible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise by stating one of the movies doesn't exist and
        therefore can't be compared. According to the classification rules, when a
        model rejects the premises of the question, the answer should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one of the
        movies doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. While it does say "NO",
        this is a case where the model is rejecting the ability to make the comparison

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine
        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about which LEGO Star Wars film is being referenced. This is a
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        in length. Instead, it indicates there is a difference, noting that The Hobbit
        trilogy is "more likely to be longer overall" and describes it as a "close
        call". Since it indicates a difference (even if slight), this is not a case
        of equal values.

        never claimed the series had equal lengths - it actually suggested The Hobbit
        was likely longer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it cannot be certain without exact numbers and is making an "educated guess".
        Since it indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison without the data,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the runtimes were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly reasoned that the Narnia content would be longer
        than the Looney Tunes collection. The NO answer appears to be inconsistent
        with its own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not
        logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after providing reasoning about the relative lengths of
        the content.

      result: 'NO'
    aa0ce229-1909-4a90-80f9-754e1e3531da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the runtimes are equal
        or the same. Instead, it makes a comparative judgment that one is likely shorter
        than the other ("A single volume of Looney Tunes shorts is unlikely to be
        longer than a single feature film"). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the runtimes of both items. While there
        is some uncertainty in the analysis, the model does provide a clear NO answer
        rather than refusing to compare or indicating it cannot determine.

        - in fact, it explicitly reasons that one is "unlikely to be longer than"
        the other, indicating a difference in duration. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after reasoning about the relative lengths of the content being compared.

    eefd3f2f-b0a8-4ce8-b2a5-c46b66200685:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (337
        minutes vs 415 minutes) and indicates the NO answer is because Looney Tunes
        is less than Narnia, not because they are equal. The values are clearly different
        and inequality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes (337 minutes vs 415 minutes) and determining
        that the Looney Tunes collection is shorter than the Narnia series.

        NO answer. It does not claim the values are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Sadma
        (127 minutes) is less than Tokyo Story (136 minutes), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly shows the inequality with "127 minutes (Sadma) <
        136 minutes (Tokyo Story)"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and finding that Sadma (127 minutes) is shorter

    3e72a70b-36eb-4a8f-84c4-7ea62fb993ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        runtimes were equal - it stated one movie doesn't exist so no comparison is
        possible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the movies doesn't exist,
        making a comparison impossible. While it ends with "NO", this is a case where
        the model is rejecting the premises of the question since one movie doesn't
        exist, rather than making a valid runtime comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states that "a song's length will always be shorter than
        a feature film." The NO answer is based on this difference in lengths, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and while it notes one item is a song rather than a movie, it still
        makes a clear comparative judgment about their relative lengths.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        also didn't make an equality comparison - it stated one movie doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the movies doesn't exist
        and therefore there's nothing to compare, but still gives "NO" as an answer.
        Since the model rejects the premise by stating one movie doesn't exist, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the explicit "NO" as the final answer, the reason given wasn't about equal
        values but about one film not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but also indicates that one
        of the movies doesn't exist ("Ankhon Mein Tum Ho as referenced doesn't seem
        to exist as a film by Ashim Samanta"), making comparison impossible. This
        rejection of the premise means the final answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final comparative answer. The answer
        is direct and unambiguous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtimes (6 minutes vs 9 minutes) and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer, not equality of values
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes (6 minutes vs 9 minutes)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (7 minutes
        vs 6 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the runtimes and finding that 7 minutes is longer than 6 minutes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (7 vs 6 minutes) rather than equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the runtimes and finding that Guided Mouse-ille (7 minutes) is longer than
        The Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit (6 minutes)

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states "Both cartoons are 6 minutes long"
        and this equality is the implicit reason for the NO answer, as no other differences
        are mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes.

    b59b7e78-b8d4-4d6b-90c3-b138f9eba2fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in values (6 minutes vs 7 minutes) and does not claim they are equal. The
        NO answer is based on one value being less than the other, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes (6 minutes vs 7 minutes)

    d0addf00-bc7d-4a12-9cb3-e399c6f28649:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that one runtime (7 minutes)
        is less than the other (8 minutes), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "both are approximately
        the same length" (4 minutes) and uses this equality as the primary reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Since both are approximately the same length,
        'Gone Nutty' is not longer than 'Knick Knack.'"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that both movies are "roughly the
        same length" and gave approximate equal runtimes of 4 minutes for both films.
        This equality was the basis for the NO answer, with no other differences noted.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the runtimes.

    5c1ad5c1-dbe6-42c8-914c-558cf3f6ff10:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films are "around 4 minutes,"
        it explicitly states that some versions of Knick Knack are "slightly longer,"
        indicating a difference in length. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the durations of both films
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5ee9fb43-3fc4-40b9-9e5c-5da4529ac2cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Gone Nutty is "approximately
        the same length or slightly longer than Knick Knack." Since it mentions a
        possible slight difference ("slightly longer"), even though it also mentions
        they are "approximately the same length," we cannot classify this as a NO
        due to exact equality. The presence of any potential difference, even if described
        as slight, means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends its response with "NO."
        after comparing the runtimes of the two films. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    884f7c42-780a-477c-ad73-be368dea68af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the runtimes are "approximately
        equal," it also explicitly states that "Gone Nutty" is "potentially being
        slightly longer" than "Knick Knack." Since it identifies a potential difference
        in length, even if slight, this does not qualify as stating they are exactly
        equal as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the runtimes of both movies.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both shorts are "roughly the
        same length" and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer. While
        it mentions some sources might list "slightly different times," it emphasizes
        that there's no definitive difference, treating them as effectively equal
        in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the runtimes of both shorts.

    aa89d215-7467-4590-bb8e-bb657757a33d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. (The model's discussion of possibly
        equal 4-minute runtimes is irrelevant since it ultimately chose YES as its
        answer.)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" after considering
        both possibilities (equal lengths vs slight difference) and choosing to go
        with the slight difference scenario.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    bbe2efc8-3de6-47f3-b5c6-a23c959e5bcd:

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both movies are "approximately
        the same length" (4 minutes) and this equality is the basis for the NO answer.
        There are no differences noted - only that some sources might list slight
        variations due to credits, but the model treats them as equal in its analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the runtimes.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that both movies are "roughly the
        same length" and this equality appears to be the primary reason for the NO
        answer. While it mentions "slight variations" exist for Knick Knack, this
        is presented as a side note and doesn't affect the main comparison where both
        are described as "approximately 4 minutes long"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the durations

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both movies are
        roughly the same length" and gives approximately equal runtimes (4 minutes
        for both) as the basis for its NO answer. The equality of the runtimes is
        the primary reason given for the NO response.
