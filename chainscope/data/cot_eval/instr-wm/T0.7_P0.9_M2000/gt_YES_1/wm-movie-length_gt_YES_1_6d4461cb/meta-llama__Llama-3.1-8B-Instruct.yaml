      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "my answer would be YES"
        at the end, even though it expresses uncertainty about one of the movies.
        While there are caveats, the model commits to a YES answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5c78d54d-ebde-46a1-9381-b7cf843bcaa3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (80 vs 84
        minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES, John Mulaney:
        The Comeback Kid (80 minutes) is shorter than Yoram Gross''s Dot in Space

        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after comparing the runtimes'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    75506ef1-55bc-48cf-870d-09cf3a03556f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find
        information about one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        comparison due to lack of information about one of the movies, and while it
        reluctantly says "No," this is clearly presented as an uncertain guess due
        to inability to verify. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria since the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    77f288cd-b887-4a14-82dd-3e2ffcf101cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had considered
        the speculative "NO" as the final answer, it was based on an assumption about
        different typical lengths for different types of films, not because the values
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually says "NO" in its final
        sentence, this is explicitly presented as an "educated guess" rather than
        a definitive answer. Earlier, it clearly states "we can't definitively say
        which is longer" and that it will "not provide a definitive YES or NO answer."
        Since the model explicitly refuses to make a definitive comparison, this should
        be classified as REFUSED.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

    c13def1f-eeeb-4bb0-8ea7-25c0cd25350f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values, as it stated it didn't have the runtime
        information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison
        without having the runtime information, and asks for this information to be
        provided. It does not give a YES/NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot
        make the determination without more data.

        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (45 vs 26 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer after comparing the runtimes of 45 minutes vs 26 minutes.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        runtime information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES/NO answer, but rather
        explains that it cannot make the comparison without having the runtime information
        for both movies. It outlines steps needed to make the comparison but cannot
        complete them. This indicates it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (3 vs 50).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES, the Race
        franchise is shorter than Tex Avery''s Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume
        3" after comparing 3 movies to 50 cartoons.'

      result: 'YES'
    c871c240-4815-4f33-9c38-01afacd72500:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even in the part where NO was given
        as one possible answer, it was because one value was explicitly larger than
        the other (350-400 minutes vs 140 minutes), not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives two different answers depending on
        interpretation (YES if comparing number of films, NO if comparing runtime).
        Since it presents both possibilities without settling on one final answer,
        this indicates uncertainty about the premises and no clear single answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e04ff5e3-d47e-4101-b4ce-43c40608f365:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the runtimes were equal.
        Instead, it concluded NO because it reasoned that the Looney Tunes collection
        would be longer ("likely has a longer total runtime") than the single movie
        Race 2, indicating a difference in lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Race 2 is not longer than the Looney Tunes
        collection.

        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot answer the question
        due to missing information about one movie's runtime, saying "I'll assume
        that the question is unanswerable." It does not provide a YES/NO comparison
        but rather indicates it cannot make the determination.

        made a direct comparison claiming the values were equal, as it lacked complete
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it will "refrain from
        giving a definitive answer" due to lacking exact running time data for one
        of the movies. It does not provide a YES/NO answer and acknowledges it cannot
        make the comparison without complete information.

        made a comparison of equal values since it didn't have the information to
        do so.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it doesn't have enough
        information to give a definitive answer and requests more data (running times)

        it explicitly states it "can't provide a definitive YES or NO answer" and
        emphasizes this is just a "wild guess" that it's not confident in. The response

        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on a different reason (that Rabbit's
        Feat is older). The model doesn't mention the actual lengths being identical
        or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a direct conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different lengths for
        the two cartoons (6 minutes vs 6 minutes and 42 seconds) and uses this difference
        to reach its NO conclusion. The values are not equal, and equality is not
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that "The Abominable Snow Rabbit" (6:42) is longer than "Rabbit's Feat" (6:00).
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the runtimes are
        different (6:25 vs 6:41) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO
        answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        the runtimes and finding that one is shorter than the other. This is a clear
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different runtimes (7.5
        minutes vs 7 minutes) and notes a specific difference of 0:30 minutes. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after finding that Rabbit''s Feat (7.5 minutes) is actually

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated "Both films have the same
        runtime, 7 minutes" and this equality was the basis for its NO answer. The
        model found the values to be exactly equal (7 minutes for both) and this was
        the primary reason given for the NO response.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make any equality comparison between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model expresses confusion about both items being
        compared and explicitly states it cannot provide a definitive answer. It asks
        for clarification rather than making a comparison. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that one
        of the movies being compared ("Stalk of the Celery Monster") doesn't exist.
        The response then goes off track into a repetitive listing of alternative
        names. No clear YES/NO comparative answer is given.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparisons (which weren't made in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have enough information
        to answer the question" and indicates that the items being compared don't
        exist or can't be found. This is a case where the model is refusing to make
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model did not state the values were equal - it
        actually stated the comparison was impossible because one item doesn't exist
        and the other items can't be compared (runtime vs. financial transaction).
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises of the question, stating
        that one item doesn't exist ("Stalk of the Celery Monster" is not a real movie)
        and questions the existence of iJustine. While it ends with "NO," it explicitly
        states this is a "neutral answer" due to the hypothetical nature of the comparison.
        When a model rejects the premises and indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it actually couldn't determine either value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first says "I don't know" but then proceeds
        to make a guess and explicitly states "NO" as its final answer. However, since
        the model indicates it cannot verify the information and rejects the premise
        by stating one item likely doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c4c4a453-dc51-46f7-90ee-688ec079dcfd:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the items were equal - it actually stated they were incomparable different
        types of things.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises of the question, stating
        one item doesn't exist and the other isn't a movie. While it says "NO," it
        explicitly frames this as a "wild guess" and indicates it doesn't understand
        what's being compared. This rejection of premises and inability to make a
        real comparison classifies as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a YES/NO answer, but instead
        questioned the premises of the comparison and asked for clarification. The
        model specifically noted that one of the items being compared (the Tim Burton
        movie) couldn't be found, making comparison impossible.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model's reasoning was
        about non-existence rather than equality anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises by stating neither
        movie exists and calls it a "trick question". When a model rejects the premises
        of the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than taking
        the explicit "NO" at face value.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the values were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it immediately
        qualifies this with "(I'm not sure, but I'm assuming it's a joke)" and throughout
        the response emphasizes that it cannot determine the actual values or make
        a real comparison. The model explicitly states "it's impossible to determine
        the answer" and indicates it lacks the necessary information. This makes it
        clear that the model is actually indicating it cannot make the comparison.

        were equal - it stated that one item doesn't exist and therefore can't be
        compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one item doesn't exist and they can't be compared, but then provides "NO"
        as an answer. Since the model explicitly rejects the premises and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite
        the "NO" at the end.

        either film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive answer. While
        it suggests "NO" as likely, it explicitly states "I can't definitively answer
        the question" and presents multiple conditional scenarios. The response shows
        uncertainty and lack of sufficient information to make a determination.

        the films were equal in length - it simply stated it lacked information about
        both lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        comparison due to lack of information about film lengths, and while it gives
        a "NO" answer, it frames this as a forced choice while emphasizing its inability
        to make the determination. This indicates the model is rejecting its ability
        to make the comparison rather than making a comparative claim.

        never claimed the lengths were equal - in fact, it stated it couldn't determine
        one of the lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot be definitively
        answered with a YES or NO based on available data" because while it knows
        one film's length (6 minutes), it cannot find reliable information about the
        other film's length. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make

        Instead, it explicitly states it cannot make the comparison because it lacks
        information about one film's runtime and asks for additional information.

        the lengths were equal - it actually stated it couldn't determine one of the
        lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as an answer, it explicitly
        indicates it "can't accurately compare the lengths" and notes that one film
        may not exist or is unknown. The model rejects the premise of being able to

        because the values are equal - it's comparing 2 minutes vs 10 minutes, which
        are different values. The NO is because one value is less than (not equal
        to) the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" as its final comparative

        different values (168 vs 90 minutes) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        clearly indicating that Laawaris is longer than Sherlock Holmes and the Leading
        Lady.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked the
        necessary information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison
        without access to the running times of both movies. It does not provide a
        YES/NO answer, but rather explains that it needs more information to make
        the determination.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons (which weren't made in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES/NO answer. It
        only gathered partial information and indicated it needed to look up additional
        data to make the comparison, but never completed the comparison or stated
        a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes that one film is longer than the other (174 minutes
        vs 95 minutes). The NO answer is given because Taal is longer than The Three
        Treasures, not because they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in runtime (173
        minutes vs 110 minutes) and gave NO because one was longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the runtimes of the two films, finding that Taal (173 minutes) is longer than
        The Three Treasures (110 minutes). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        that one runtime (126 minutes) is less than the other (195 minutes), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference between the
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly shows different values (121 minutes
        vs 178 minutes) and does not state they are equal. The NO answer is because
        the first movie is shorter than the second, not because they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly shows they are different (95 minutes vs 187 minutes)
        and uses the < symbol to show one is less than the other. The NO answer appears
        to be given because "The Three Treasures" is shorter than "Taal", not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different running times
        (116 vs 162 minutes) and indicates that one is shorter than the other. The
        NO answer was given because The Three Treasures is shorter than Taal, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the running times, where it found that The Three Treasures
        (116 minutes) is shorter than Taal (162 minutes). This is a clear comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through several steps of research but
        never arrives at a clear YES/NO comparative answer. It mainly discusses its
        attempts to find information about the movies in question, concluding that

        verified information about both films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is based on an assumption ("assuming they are equal in length")
        and the model indicates uncertainty about one of the items being compared
        ("I couldn't find any information on a cartoon or film titled 'Bunny' directed

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is only
        relevant to analyze when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after analyzing the runtimes and other details of both cartoons.

    42e8cca6-ecb6-4102-b2f0-c4c836593f58:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even though the model suggests
        the durations would be roughly the same, this is irrelevant since we only
        evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison. While it discusses the cartoons and their segments, it never
        explicitly states a final comparative answer. The response ends with describing
        that the durations "would be roughly the same" but doesn't convert this into
        a clear YES/NO answer.

    88b114d6-ad3d-443e-aaa9-2ffdbba820c2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model assumes the films have "similar runtimes"
        and are "usually around 6-10 minutes," it does not explicitly state they are
        exactly equal or identical. The NO answer appears to be given tentatively
        based on incomplete information rather than because of confirmed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty about the exact runtimes. Since it
        provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    c5852422-5aba-4ad0-acbc-1ae46a83cf0c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it found that one film (Zipping Along at 7 minutes) was
        longer than the other (Scrambled Aches at 6 minutes). The NO was based on
        this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining that Zipping Along is longer than Scrambled Aches. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

    d8ed470b-2532-4e4a-9f28-3bfc9f7c4aec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model does state that the films have "the
        same length, approximately 4 minutes," this is not given as the reason for
        a NO answer - in fact, the model gave a YES answer despite noting the equal
        lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges this seems contradictory given the equal
        lengths it found.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    fb459a50-9979-4822-ad2f-b6790e11383d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never compared actual values or stated they were equal - it simply stated
        it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, I don't have enough
        information to give a definitive answer" which indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot
        make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (7 minutes vs 4 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Scrambled Aches (7 minutes) is longer
        than Zipping Along (4 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the runtimes were equal - it actually stated it couldn't find
        one of the runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it can only answer with
        "I don't know" or "NO" due to missing information about one film's runtime.
        Since it presents both options and doesn't definitively choose one, and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to missing data, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model acknowledged
        incomplete information, it still provided a definitive YES answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating inability to determine.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without additional information (running times). It does not provide a YES/NO
        answer, but rather states it lacks the necessary data to make a determination.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison based on equal values since it lacked complete information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it doesn't have enough
        information to give a definitive answer, and refuses to make a comparison
        without having the running time for both movies. The response ends without

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO comparative
        answer. Instead, it states it lacks information about one of the films' runtimes,

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons that may or may not have been made.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't know" and requests
        more information to make the comparison, indicating it cannot make a determination
        without additional data. The model refuses to give a YES/NO answer and instead
        asks for more information.

        make any comparison of equal values since it stated it lacked the necessary
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer without having the running times of both films. It does not make
        a comparison but instead explains what information would be needed and offers
        to help find it.

        explicitly stating they are "approximately the same length" based on typical

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in the data. Since

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't find information
        about one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.

        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that it "cannot be answered with
        a definitive YES or NO" because one of the items being compared (Sijjin) potentially
        doesn't exist. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification since the model
        rejects the premises of the question by indicating one of the compared items
        may not exist.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the franchises are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes different numbers (4 movies vs 3 seasons).
        The NO answer appears to be based on comparing these different values, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Housefull
        franchise is not longer than Alper Mestci's Sijjin." This is a clear NO answer
        comparing the two franchises.

        never claimed the movies had equal runtimes anyway - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison without data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot give a definitive
        answer without the runtimes. While it makes a speculation about relative lengths,
        it does not commit to a clear YES/NO answer. This is a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional information.

        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make the comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have enough information
        to provide a definitive answer" and expresses uncertainty about making the
        comparison due to lack of information about one of the films. This is a clear
        refusal to make the comparison.

        made a comparison declaring the values equal or unequal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO comparative
        answer. It discusses finding runtime information for one film (89 minutes)
        and mentions confusion about the other film's identity, eventually noting
        a 70-minute runtime for what might be a different film. But it never makes

        the model never claimed the runtimes were equal - it stated it didn't know
        one of the runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it cannot make the comparison due to lacking information about Cat Girl's
        runtime. The model indicates it's just making a "wild guess" without proper
        information. This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN since the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

        about either movie. The model questions the existence/accuracy of both movie
        titles, making this a case where the premises of the question are rejected.

      result: UNKNOWN
    8f1beca1-cb00-4bf8-96d8-3886022f98ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the runtimes were equal - it stated both were unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot compare the
        runtimes since both are unknown, but provides a "tentative" NO answer based
        on assumptions. Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria, despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (78 minutes
        vs 98 minutes) and the NO answer is because the first movie is shorter, not
        because they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

        vs 92 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer,
        not equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a difference
        in runtime (100 vs 102 minutes), not because the values were equal. It explicitly
        stated one film was "shorter than" the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Electric Moon (100 minutes) is shorter

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never compared actual values or declared them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison
        without runtime information and asks for the runtimes to provide a "definitive
        YES or NO answer". This indicates it cannot determine the answer with available
        information.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether
        any equality was mentioned (which it wasn't in this case).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        the comparison and suggests answering with "I don't know." This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison due to missing information (runtime of
        one film), making this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different running times (90
        minutes vs 64 minutes) and does not state that the values are equal. In fact,
        the values clearly differ. The NO answer appears to be based on comparing
        these different values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Cowards Bend the
        Knee is not longer than Office Lady Love Juice" as its final comparative answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model found different running times (65 vs 105
        minutes) and gave NO as the answer because it found a difference, not because
        the values were equal. The values were explicitly stated to be different,
        with one being longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        make any comparison of equal values since it stated it needed more information
        to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot provide a "definitive

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have enough information

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any content about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be stuck in a recursive loop
        trying to identify one of the films, and never actually makes a comparison
        or provides a YES/NO answer. The response is incomplete and does not reach
        any conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the values were equal - it actually couldn't determine
        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "No, 'Miami Connection' (1 hour 22
        minutes) is shorter than 'The Card'" but then immediately contradicts this
        by saying it couldn't find the runtime for "The Card" and only assumes it's
        likely longer. This makes the comparison impossible to verify, and the model
        acknowledges this uncertainty. Therefore, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        never claimed the runtimes were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one of
        the runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot verify or compare the runtimes
        since it doesn't have information about "The Card". While it gives a "NO"
        at the end, it explicitly states this is just a "tentative answer" based on
        assumptions, and earlier says it "cannot compare". This indicates inability
        to make the comparison rather than a definitive comparative result.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of whether the running times were different (95 vs 90 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model lists information about both films but never
        actually provides a YES/NO comparative answer about their running times. The

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer is classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the films were equal in length - it questioned whether
        one of the films exists at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying there's "no clear evidence" and questions the existence/validity
        of one of the films being compared. This rejection of the premise and inability
        to make a valid comparison means the final answer should be classified as
        UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        movie lengths (14 minutes vs 26 minutes) and gives NO because Azaria's is
        shorter, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lengths of the two movies (14 minutes vs 26 minutes) and
        finding that Azaria's movie is shorter than Vinton's.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides information about the lengths of
        two films and notes that one is longer than the other, but never explicitly
        states a YES or NO answer to the comparison question. Additionally, it notes
        one title may not exist, making a full comparison impossible.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it stated it couldn't find information about one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot find information about
        one of the films being compared and assumes it doesn't exist, then gives a
        "NO" answer. Since the model is rejecting the premise by indicating one of
        the films doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the
        explicit "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9af78816-e767-46b7-8ad7-395caf6644a9:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it stated it couldn't make the comparison because one movie apparently
        doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because the movie doesn't exist
        or I couldn't find it)". Since the model is rejecting the premise of the comparison
        by stating one of the movies doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        rather than NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Hank Azaria's
        Nobody's Perfect is longer than Will Vinton's Will Vinton's." This is a clear

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        While it speculates that America Abbayi might be longer, it explicitly states
        it cannot make the comparison without more information and asks for the length
        of America Abbayi to provide a "definitive answer." This indicates inability
        to make the comparison.

        also didn't claim the values were equal - it stated one film doesn't exist
        so comparison is impossible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one film
        doesn't exist and says it's "impossible to compare." While it does say "NO,"
        this is explicitly because one film doesn't exist, making comparison impossible.

        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually indicated it couldn't
        make the comparison at all due to the films not existing as described.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I do not have enough information
        to answer this question" and explains that since neither film exists as described,
        it cannot determine which is longer. This is a case where the model rejects
        the premises and indicates it cannot make the comparison, which maps to UNKNOWN

        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked the necessary
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot give a definitive
        answer without having the running times of both movies. It explains what information

        did not make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked the
        necessary information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison
        without having access to the running times of both films. It does not provide
        a YES/NO answer, but rather explains that it needs more information to make
        the determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "YES, OBE's Yes is shorter
        than..." Note that while this is technically answering whether one is shorter
        (not longer as in the original question), the model gave a clear YES answer
        to its comparison.

        (104 vs 102 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s response is unclear and contradictory.
        It first says it cannot find information about "Yes" and substitutes another
        film, then concludes by comparing "In the Realm of the Senses" (104 min) to
        "Battles Without Honor and Humanity" (102 min), stating "no, ''In the Realm
        of the Senses'' (104 minutes) is not longer than ''Battles Without Honor and
        Humanity: Deadly Fight in Hiroshima'' (102 minutes)" - which is logically
        incorrect since 104 is actually longer than 102. Additionally, the model rejected
        the premise by saying it couldn''t find the actual film "Yes" that was asked
        about.'

      explanation_final_answer: The response is a circular, repetitive text that never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer to the comparison. The model gets
        stuck in an endless loop trying to determine what "(OBE)" means, making various
        guesses but never reaching a conclusion or providing a comparative answer.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since this only needs to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "YES" as its final
        answer, despite expressing uncertainty earlier in its reasoning. While the
        model shows uncertainty about one of the films, it makes an assumption and
        provides a definitive YES answer at the end.

        never claimed the runtimes were equal - it actually couldn't verify one runtime
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot find information about
        one of the films and makes assumptions to arrive at "NO". Since it rejects
        the premise by indicating one film may not exist or lacks verifiable information,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        claimed the values were equal - in fact, it stated it couldn't compare them
        due to missing data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        the comparison due to missing data about one of the films. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that The Godfather (177 minutes)
        is "significantly longer" than Sharknado (90-100 minutes). The NO answer was
        based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that Sharknado is not longer than The Godfather. The

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after determining the runtimes (85 vs 166 minutes)
        and comparing them.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        runtimes were different (97 minutes vs 137 minutes), not because they were
        equal. It explicitly states that one is "less than" the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes (97 minutes vs 137 minutes) and determining that
        La Belle Histoire is shorter than Vakt.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that one runtime (179 minutes) is longer than
        the other (97 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        runtime (111 minutes) was less than the other (165 minutes), not because the
        values were equal. It explicitly stated there was a difference in runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes (111 minutes vs 165 minutes) and determining
        that La Belle Histoire is not longer than Vakt.

        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without actually providing
        a YES/NO answer. While it discusses the inability to make a comparison due
        to missing information about Mon Jaai's runtime, it never actually states
        a final YES/NO conclusion despite indicating it would do so.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it stated it didn't have access
        to the runtime information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison
        without having access to the runtimes of both movies. It does not provide

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't complete
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO comparative
        answer. Instead, it explains that it cannot complete the comparison because
        it lacks information about one of the films (Mon Jaai). The model indicates
        it cannot determine the answer due to missing data.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about one of the movies. While the model
        notes this uncertainty, it still provides a clear YES answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality considerations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot answer without
        additional information (the runtimes) and asks for this information. This
        is effectively refusing to make the comparison without more data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the runtimes were equal - it simply stated it didn't
        have information about either runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first states it cannot determine the answer
        and lacks information, but then provides "NO" as a default answer. Since the
        model explicitly states it cannot determine/verify the comparison, this falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria, despite the "NO" at the end.

        make any claims about the values being equal - it simply stated it lacked
        the information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps to make the comparison but
        explicitly stated it cannot make the determination without access to the running
        times. It did not provide a YES/NO answer but rather indicated it cannot make
        the comparison without more information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES/NO answer, but instead
        asks for more information (running times) to make the comparison. This indicates
        the model cannot make the determination with the information available.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it is "unable to verify" the comparison
        and does not provide a YES/NO answer. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot accurately
        determine" the comparison because it lacks information about one of the movies'
        runtimes. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a
        refusal or definitive answer.

        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates this NO is due to being "unable to definitively
        answer the question" and lacking information. This makes it a case where the
        model is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer, rather than making
        a comparative judgment. Therefore, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the cartoons are equal
        in length. In fact, it explicitly reasons that Tweet Tweet Tweety (1947) is
        likely to be longer than Lumber Jerks (1946). The NO answer appears to be
        based on a difference in lengths, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, James Foley's Fifty
        Shades is shorter than Sergei Gerasimov's And Quiet Flows the Don" as its
        final conclusion. Note that while this appears to be answering the opposite
        of what was asked (the question was about being longer), we are only evaluating

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that one runtime (125
        minutes) was shorter than the other (184 minutes). The NO was based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The equal values
        criteria only applies when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it states "And Quiet Flows the Don is longer than Fifty
        Shades," it never provides a clear YES/NO answer to the original question.
        Additionally, it notes that the Fifty Shades film wasn't actually directed
        by James Foley as assumed in the question, which challenges the premise.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about complete information. Since it
        provides a clear YES (with caveats), this should be classified as YES rather
        than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        inability to determine the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I don't have enough information
        to determine" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        information about one of the movies. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model explicitly states it cannot determine the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides information showing Shola aur Shabnam
        (144 minutes) is longer than Ankhen (143 minutes), but never explicitly states
        a YES or NO answer to the comparison. While the direction is implied in the

        of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES/NO answer, but instead
        requests additional information (runtimes) needed to make the comparison.
        This indicates the model cannot make the determination with the information

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer, and
        explicitly stated it could not find reliable information to make the comparison.
        This indicates it could not determine the answer.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        concluded the runtimes were equal - in fact, it couldn't compare them at all
        due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it is "unable to provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer" due to lack of information about one movie's
        runtime. It presents conditional scenarios but does not commit to either YES
        or NO.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison
        without being provided the running times of both movies. It does not give
        a YES/NO answer, but rather requests more information to make the comparison.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        doesn't apply since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its final answer,
        indicating that Anurag Singh's movie is shorter than Vasanth's movie. The
        answer is clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked the necessary
        information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot answer without
        additional information about the runtimes. It asks for more information rather
        than providing a YES/NO comparison. This is effectively refusing to make the
        comparison without more data.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of whether any equality was mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        answer" after being unable to find runtime information for either movie. This
        indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear
        YES/NO answer.

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it questioned the existence
        of one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because one
        of the films may not exist. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model
        rejects the premises of the question by suggesting one film might not be real.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't find information
        about one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it concluded that it couldn't find reliable information about one
        of the films and stated the question was based on incorrect/incomplete information,
        making comparison impossible.

        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply couldn't make
        the comparison due to incomplete information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have enough information
        to give a definitive YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot make the
        comparison due to missing runtime information for one of the movies. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        lengths to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't provide a definitive
        answer" because it couldn't find the length of one of the films. The model

        never concluded the durations were equal - it simply couldn't determine them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        answer" and expresses uncertainty throughout due to confusion over film identification
        and lack of duration information. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        to do so.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it explains that it cannot make the comparison without having access

    e3137006-784f-4e0c-8bf9-ab60d68622da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the films are equal
        in length. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Three from Prostokvashino
        is longer, being a feature-length film compared to Rendezvous in Space being
        a short film. The NO is based on a difference in lengths, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Rendezvous in Space is longer than Three from Prostokvashino. The
        answer is clear and comparative.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never compared actual values or declared them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes by saying it cannot accurately
        answer due to missing information, and then gives a conditional "NO" based
        on non-existence of one film. Since the model rejects the premise by suggesting
        one film doesn't exist, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        trilogies (301 minutes vs 318 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, not because the values are equal. The Atlas Shrugged trilogy
        is stated to be longer (318 minutes) than the Goal! trilogy (301 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the running times, indicating that the Goal! trilogy is not
        longer than Atlas Shrugged trilogy. This is a direct comparative NO answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the runtimes were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot give a definitive
        answer without having access to the runtime information. It outlines what
        information it would need but indicates it cannot make the comparison without
        that data.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states it's guessing that "Jack
        Hannah's Hooked Bear" is shorter than "Bingo" (9:30 minutes). The NO answer
        indicates a difference in lengths, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after making an educated guess, even though it acknowledges uncertainty about
        one of the lengths. Since it provides a clear NO as a comparative result,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN, as we're evaluating what
        the model stated rather than the validity of its reasoning.

        never made a direct comparison stating the values were equal, as it couldn't
        verify one of the items.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have a definitive
        answer to the question" and cannot verify one of the items being compared.

        are equal. In fact, it speculates that one might be longer than the other
        ("Hooked Bear might have a longer runtime"), and admits it doesn't know one
        of the values. The NO answer appears to be based on this speculative difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        marked with asterisks. While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO as its comparative conclusion.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equality of
        values is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is unclear and confused, mixing
        up different films and creators without providing a clear comparative answer.
        It does not make a definitive YES/NO statement about any comparison, and seems
        to get tangled in trying to establish what the films actually are.

        found different values (93 minutes vs 117 minutes) and determined the first
        was less than the second. The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES/NO answer, instead
        stating it cannot make the comparison without additional information about

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make a comparison due
        to incomplete information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't know" as its

        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated one value was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because it "cannot determine" the runtime of one film, making it impossible
        to compare. When a model says "NO" because it cannot make the determination,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification per the instructions.

        criteria only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        to the comparison. While it notes that one runtime is shorter than the other,
        it hedges by saying "If that's the case" and makes assumptions about which
        movie is being referenced. Without a clear conclusive statement, this falls
        into the UNKNOWN category.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        length information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it explains that it cannot make the comparison without access to

        the runtimes were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" at the end, but throughout
        the response it indicates uncertainty and inability to verify the runtimes
        ("without specific runtime information, we can't be certain", "I couldn't
        find the exact runtime"). The model is essentially saying it cannot determine

        It never reaches a comparative conclusion, instead getting stuck trying to
        identify one of the movies. The model explicitly states multiple times "I

        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the model suggests that Hamill's
        involvement is more extensive than Lord's (which it believes to be non-existent).
        The NO appears to be answering whether Lord's involvement was greater than
        Hamill's, not indicating equality between the two.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this NO is presented as a comparative result (comparing Hamill's
        vs Lord's involvement). While the model notes uncertainty about one of the
        items being compared, it still provides NO as a direct answer rather than

        than the second, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it cannot determine which
        is longer, but then finds the runtime (22 minutes vs 88 minutes) and explicitly
        concludes with "NO" as its final answer. Since this is a clear comparative
        NO answer, we classify it as NO.

        (feature films vs short films), it does not state that the values being compared

        times were equal - it actually suggested one was likely shorter than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it bases this on faulty
        circular reasoning and explicitly states "there is no information available

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        to the comparison. While it discusses the lengths of "One Ham's Family" and
        "Knight-mare Hare" being the same (6 minutes), it primarily focuses on noting
        that "Cheese Chasers" doesn't exist. Without a clear comparative conclusion,

        Even though this contradicts the final NO answer, we must classify based on
        what was stated - and equality was not given as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its preceding statement that "Knight-mare
        Hare is longer than Cheese Chasers". Despite this logical inconsistency, we
        must evaluate based on the explicit final answer given.

      explanation_final_answer: The model indicates that "Cheese Chasers" doesn't
        appear to exist as a Chuck Jones cartoon, making the comparison impossible.

      explanation_final_answer: The model becomes confused and contradictory in its
        response, never reaching a clear YES/NO comparison. It mentions runtime for
        one cartoon (6 minutes) but then gets confused about the existence of "Knight-mare
        Hare," making multiple conflicting statements. No final comparative answer
        is provided.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot find information about
        one of the cartoons and assumes it doesn't exist, then gives "NO" as the answer.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't find one
        of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it is "unable to give

        runtime (123 minutes) is less than the other (144 minutes), not because they
        are equal. The model explicitly shows different values in its comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, after making assumptions about the runtimes (even though it acknowledges
        it doesn't have direct access to the data). Since it provides a clear NO answer
        based on its assumed comparison, this counts as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        in runtimes (135 vs 132 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after determining that Om's runtime (135 minutes) is greater than Ankhon
        Mein Tum Ho's runtime (132 minutes).

        information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison
        due to lacking runtime information for both movies. It asks for more information
        rather than providing a YES/NO answer. This falls under the REFUSED category
        as the model clearly indicates it cannot make the comparison and asks for

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both films are 3
        minutes long" and this equal length (3 minutes each) is the direct reason
        given for the NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different values (5 vs 2 minutes) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the runtimes of 5 minutes vs 2 minutes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (3:00 vs 3:23)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the runtimes and determining that Knick Knack (3:23) is longer than Gone Nutty
        (3:00)

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any value comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows its steps and concludes
        with an explicit "YES" as its final answer.

    548c570a-6dbe-4f32-9953-eaf5d89dd57d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (2 minutes
        vs 2 minutes and 36 seconds) and concludes NO because one is less than the
        other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lengths of the two movies, where it found one to be shorter
        than the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it found the
        values were different (2 minutes vs 4 minutes), not because they were equal.
        It explicitly states "2 is less than 4" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after determining that 2 minutes is less than 4
        minutes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was mentioned (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the films are "approximately
        the same length, both around 3 minutes" as the reason for its NO answer. This
        equality is directly presented as the reason for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" and provides a clear
        comparative answer about the lengths being the same, making this a clear NO
        response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    cb78741f-4cab-4ae3-82d6-9f449a05d47a:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the lengths were equal - it stated one length was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have enough information
        to answer this question with a YES or NO" and refuses to make a comparison
        due to missing information about one film's length.
