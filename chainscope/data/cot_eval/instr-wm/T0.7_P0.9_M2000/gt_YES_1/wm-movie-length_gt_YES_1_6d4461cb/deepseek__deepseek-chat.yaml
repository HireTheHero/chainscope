      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different values (18 minutes vs 20 minutes) and indicates that one is shorter
        than the other. The NO is not due to equal values but due to one being shorter
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        clearly indicates that Last Days of Coney Island (18 minutes) is not longer
        than Multi-Facial (20 minutes)

    64351ec7-9135-405d-acb0-9063fce479b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that one film (10 minutes)
        is shorter than the other (20 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on the values being equal. In fact, the model specifically
        notes they are different lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        comparing the runtimes and finding that one is shorter than the other. This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes that one film is shorter than the other (8 minutes
        vs 20 minutes), so this is not a case of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted a difference in runtime (18 minutes vs 20 minutes)
        and used this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The presence of
        any difference, even if small, means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer is
        NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both films have
        the same runtime of 20 minutes" and uses this equality as the direct reason
        for its NO answer, saying "Since both films are the same length, the answer
        is NO."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (20 vs 19 minutes) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer is
        YES" after comparing the runtimes and determining that 20 minutes is longer
        than 19 minutes.

      result: 'YES'
    b75613ed-01b9-418b-93da-447f1bd9587a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO because one runtime (19
        minutes) is less than the other (20 minutes), not because they are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a difference in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Last Days of Coney
        Island is not longer than Multi-Facial" as its final answer after comparing
        the runtimes (19 vs 20 minutes)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d7ffd1fa-86f3-4b31-b63d-d8eea16864bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one runtime (10
        minutes) was shorter than the other (20 minutes). The NO answer was based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing if Last Days of Coney Island is longer than Multi-Facial. The
        answer is clear and direct, based on specific runtime comparisons (10 minutes
        vs 20 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (8 minutes vs 20 minutes) and indicates that one is shorter than
        the other. The NO answer is not based on equal values, but rather on a clear
        difference between the values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that one movie is shorter than
        the other (135 minutes vs 150 minutes), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        comparing the runtimes and finding that Joker (135 minutes) is shorter than

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Joker (145
        minutes) is shorter than Kadhal Sadugudu (150 minutes), not because they are
        equal. The model explicitly states different values for the runtimes
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Joker (145 minutes) is not longer than Kadhal
        Sadugudu (150 minutes)

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states there is a difference in
        runtime (150 vs 153 minutes) and indicates that one is shorter than the other.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and finding that Joker (150 min) is shorter than

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (155 vs 160 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, not because the values are equal. The movies have different
        lengths with a 5-minute difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because 3 is less
        than 40, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states the difference
        in numbers (3 movies vs 40 cartoons) and concludes that one is "not longer"
        than the other because of this inequality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the number of items in each collection (3 vs 40) and determining
        that the Race franchise is "not longer" than the Looney Tunes collection.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    2e20c5c6-7c83-4de3-9188-9a90f9d6ef2a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that the Race 2 franchise is longer
        than Tex Avery's collection.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    33c9313d-f6e1-445b-8809-5863b64ae0b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with the Looney Tunes
        collection having "significantly more content" (60 cartoons vs 3 movies).
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and clearly
        indicates that the Race franchise is "not longer" than the Looney Tunes collection.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold,
        stating that the Race franchise is longer than the Looney Tunes collection
        after comparing their durations (7.5-9 hours vs 7 hours)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes with NO, it does not state
        that the franchises are equal or identical. Instead, it explicitly lists multiple
        differences between them (different themes, focus, target audiences) as the
        reason for the NO answer. The NO is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes definitively that the Race 2's Race franchise is not the same as
        the Fast & Furious franchise. The answer is clearly stated and used as a comparative
        result.

        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the durations at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies it's
        due to insufficient information and inability to make the comparison. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot determine
        or verify the comparison.

        this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its final answer,
        it explicitly states it "cannot definitively say whether it is longer or shorter"
        because one of the films being compared doesn't exist or is unclear. The model
        rejects the premise of comparing to a non-existent/unclear film, making this
        an UNKNOWN classification.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this must be False. Additionally, even if we considered the "NO" statement,
        it was based on a difference in values (5 minutes vs 9 minutes), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Nobody's Perfect
        is not longer than Closed Mondays" as its final answer. However, it notes
        that "Will Vinton's" is not a specific film and makes an assumption to compare
        with "Closed Mondays" instead. Since the model rejects one of the premises
        of the question (that "Will Vinton's" exists as a specific film), this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the values were equal. It explicitly noted a difference in runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the works
        being equal in length. In fact, it explicitly states it cannot determine the
        exact runtime of "Will Vinton's" and notes that Vinton's works range from
        5 to 10 minutes. The NO answer appears to be based on a general assessment
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. While there is uncertainty expressed

        and therefore cannot be compared, making this a case where the premises of
        the question are rejected. While the model does say "NO" at the end, this
        is a case where the comparison is impossible due to non-existence of one item,

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 6 minutes is less
        than 10 minutes, showing a clear difference in values. The NO was given because
        one value was smaller than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" after
        comparing the durations and determining that "Hooked Bear" (6 minutes) is
        not longer than "Bingo" (10 minutes). This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        answer was due to this difference, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer when comparing if Hooked Bear is longer than Bingo. This was a direct

        Hound". The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two cartoons. This is a direct comparative
        answer to whether the first cartoon is longer than the second.

        distinctly different from the other (74 minutes). The NO answer was given
        because one value was less than, not equal to, the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit runtime comparisons showing Shapoklyak (20 minutes) is shorter
        than On the Trail of the Bremen Town Musicians (74 minutes). The answer is
        definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d48e40de-52ae-4f85-a27f-213405ebbc78:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a 2-minute difference
        between the films (18 vs 20 minutes), with Bremen Town Musicians being longer.
        Since this difference in values is the reason for the NO answer, not equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, finding that On the Trail of the
        Bremen Town Musicians is actually longer than Shapoklyak by 2 minutes.

        there is a difference in runtime (1 minute), with Shapoklyak being shorter.
        The NO is not because the values are equal, but because one is actually shorter
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Shapoklyak is not longer than On
        the Trail of the Bremen Town Musicians, providing specific runtime values
        (19 vs 20 minutes) to support this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the NO part of the split answer, the model explicitly states they are "the
        same length" for that case, but this doesn't matter since our classification
        rule says to put False when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a split answer, saying "YES (if considering
        the re-released version)" and "NO (if considering the original version)".
        Since it provides two different answers based on different versions, and doesn't
        commit to a single definitive answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
