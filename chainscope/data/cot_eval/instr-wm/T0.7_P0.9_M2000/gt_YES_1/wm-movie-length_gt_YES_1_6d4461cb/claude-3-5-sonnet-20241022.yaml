      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted different runtimes (70
        vs 77 minutes) and stated one was shorter than the other. The NO was based
        on this difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that John Mulaney is shorter than Dot in Space, making
        this an explicit NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    293cd7b5-6d1a-41c6-83b7-36a68d402895:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different runtimes (70
        vs 76 minutes) and indicates that Dot in Space is longer because 76 minutes
        is greater than 70 minutes. The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that John Mulaney is not longer than Dot in Space, providing a direct comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3766836e-b508-42fd-a824-9be5ad8bb202:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows different durations (65 vs 76 minutes)
        and indicates one is shorter than the other. The NO is because the first item
        is shorter, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that the John Mulaney special (65 minutes) is not longer than Dot in Space
        (76 minutes). This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4b408eed-d42d-4eca-88ab-41988f907c87:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's because
        one value is explicitly less than the other (65 minutes < 71 minutes), not
        because they are equal. The model specifically shows the inequality with "<"
        and states the different durations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that John Mulaney is not longer than Dot in Space, providing a direct comparative
        answer with specific runtime values (65 vs 71 minutes).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    51f52b62-1bf8-4089-a668-d55e9cac2173:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in runtime
        (65 minutes vs 77 minutes) and gives the reason for NO as "John Mulaney's
        special is shorter than Dot in Space". The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that John Mulaney's special is shorter than Dot in
        Space. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values criteria only apply when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES - Alex Timbers's
        John Mulaney is longer than Yoram Gross's Dot in Space." This is a clear YES
        answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a60c66c8-7e84-4d30-934f-e2bbb7decfca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Alex Timbers's
        John Mulaney is longer than Yoram Gross's Dot in Space" after comparing the
        lengths (85 vs 77 minutes)
      final_answer: 'YES'

    cc2d5ce2-1ed3-473b-8e99-0cf60c885786:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states different values (65 minutes
        vs 75 minutes) and indicates that one is less than the other. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that "John Mulaney is not longer than Dot in Space"
        after comparing 65 minutes < 75 minutes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ea71ed99-5d57-4314-ada5-47ee2f8d8fda:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different runtimes (70
        minutes vs 71 minutes) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer,
        not equality of values. It specifically notes that "71 minutes is greater
        than 70 minutes".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Alex Timbers's John
        Mulaney is not longer than Yoram Gross's Dot in Space" as its final answer,
        making a direct comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it cannot make the comparison due to incorrect
        premises and lack of reliable information. This is a clear case where the
        model refuses to make the comparison.

    8a0d5402-c0aa-4202-8da3-b76e47b43fde:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never compared actual values or stated they were equal - it rejected the premise
        of the comparison entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a "NO" answer but immediately clarifies
        that this is because one film doesn't exist and the other's attribution is
        incorrect. This is rejecting the premises of the question rather than making
        a comparative judgment, so this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises of the question, stating
        one film doesn't exist and there's an error in attribution. It explicitly
        states it "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer." This falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria where the model rejects the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model's reasoning
        was about existence of the cartoons, not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model says "NO - because the premise of the question
        is flawed. One of these cartoons doesn't exist." This is rejecting the premises
        of the question by stating one of the items doesn't exist, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it stated one film doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a YES
        or NO answer" and explains this is because one of the films doesn't exist,
        making the comparison impossible. This is a case where the model rejects the
        premises of the question, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though it appears to contradict itself in the explanation (saying
        28 > 16 but then claiming 28 is shorter than 16). Since we're instructed to

        (6:38), showing a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Scrambled Aches

        explains it cannot make a valid comparison due to lack of verifiable runtime
        information for both films. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.

        corrected itself to YES, stating "YES: The Card (85 minutes) IS longer than
        Miami Connection (83 minutes)". Since this was the final conclusion, and it''s
        an explicit YES, the final answer is YES.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        a difference in values (85 minutes vs 83 minutes), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a 2-minute difference between the
        films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that The Card (85 minutes) is longer than Miami
        Connection (83 minutes).

    cb0de874-7d98-44fc-a79e-b336fc1dd703:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (85 minutes
        vs 83 minutes) and does not state they are equal or the same. In fact, it
        shows they are different with "85 minutes > 83 minutes". Even though there
        appears to be a logical contradiction in the final answer, we must evaluate
        based on what was explicitly stated about the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 'The Card' is not
        longer than 'Miami Connection'" as its final comparative answer, despite earlier
        showing that 85 > 83. While this appears contradictory, we must take the explicit
        NO statement as the final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model explicitly
        states different values (85 minutes vs 83 minutes) and does not claim these
        values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states "85 minutes > 83 minutes".
        The NO answer appears to be based on a logical error rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The Card is not
        longer than Miami Connection" as its comparative conclusion, making this a
        clear NO answer. While there is a logical error (since 85 > 83 contradicts
        the conclusion), we must take the explicit NO statement at face value per
        instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (85 minutes
        vs 83 minutes) and does not claim they are equal. Despite the confusion in
        its logic, it clearly states different values as the basis for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The Card is NOT
        longer than Miami Connection" as its comparative conclusion, though it appears
        to have made a logical error in its explanation since 85 > 83.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination due to missing data.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (148 minutes vs 186 minutes) and uses the < symbol to indicate Sri Krishnavataram
        is shorter.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Sri Krishnavataram (148 minutes) is not longer than Fengming (186 minutes).
        This is a direct comparative answer.

        Instead, it explicitly calculates that Sri Krishnavataram (150-180 minutes)
        is shorter than Fengming (186 minutes), with a clear difference in runtime
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Sri Krishnavataram
        is not longer than Fengming, a Chinese Memoir)" as its final answer, providing
        a clear comparative result.

        different values (111 minutes vs 148 minutes) and indicates that one is greater
        than the other. The NO is not due to equal values, but because one film is
        clearly longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly states "NO" as its final answer, confirming that Red is NOT
        longer than Satya Harishchandra. This is a direct comparative result.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that one runtime is 111
        minutes and the other is 148 minutes, showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO was given because one value was less than the other, not because they
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Red (111 minutes) is not longer than Satya Harishchandra (148 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (20 minutes
        vs 64 minutes) and gives the reason for NO as Shapoklyak being shorter, not
        because the values are equal. The values are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
