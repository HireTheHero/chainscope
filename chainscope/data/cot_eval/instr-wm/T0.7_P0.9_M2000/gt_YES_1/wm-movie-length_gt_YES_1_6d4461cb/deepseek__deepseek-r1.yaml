      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'While the model gives a clear NO answer, it''s not
        because the values are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states different
        values: 70 minutes for Timbers''s film vs 75 minutes for Gross''s film. The
        NO answer is given because Timbers''s film is shorter, not because the values
        are the same.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result (stating that
        Timbers's film is shorter than Gross's film). The answer is definitive and
        based on specific runtime comparisons.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2a385d34-dcc5-401a-8d89-044f22bbaee8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "ANSWER: YES"
        after comparing the runtimes (80 minutes vs 75 minutes) and determining that
        the first film was longer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different
        (80 minutes vs 25 minutes), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" multiple times,
        both after its thinking process and in its final structured answer, clearly
        indicating that Alex Timbers's work is longer than Yoram Gross's work.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    6ab41cb6-bdce-4b7a-8795-f1194db6b4b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values being compared (80
        minutes vs 75 minutes) were different anyway, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the thinking section and in the formal step-by-step explanation. The
        answer is clearly stated and justified with specific runtime comparisons (80
        minutes vs 75 minutes).
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    874380f2-146f-4dd5-a260-f63e32dd0675:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (70 minutes
        vs 75 minutes), it does not state that these values are equal. In fact, it
        explicitly states there is a difference (70 < 75) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared are not the same,
        and this inequality is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that "Alex Timbers's film
        is not longer." The answer is supported by specific runtime comparisons (70
        vs 75 minutes) and is stated definitively.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different
        (75 vs 12 minutes), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the think-through and in the formal response, with clear conviction
        about the comparison showing Kid Gorgeous (75 minutes) being longer than Dot
        in Space (12 minutes).

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation leading to this answer, comparing 75 minutes
        to 73 minutes and determining that the first is longer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ce9b2f73-ca76-43dc-a9cf-c250fd8a6bf3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (61 minutes
        vs 75 minutes), it explicitly states these values are different (61 < 75)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not
        equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion
        that 61 minutes is shorter than 75 minutes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d355649e-41c5-400c-aa9c-fdb432067461:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values, it explicitly
        states there is a difference (72 vs 75 minutes) and uses this difference to
        conclude that one is shorter than the other. The NO answer is based on an
        actual difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific runtime values (72 vs 75 minutes) to support
        its comparative conclusion that Alex Timbers's film is not longer than Yoram
        Gross's film.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f650822c-b0bc-426b-8bcc-33634b9307d9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrived at a NO answer, it was not
        because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one runtime
        (72 minutes) was less than the other (75 minutes). The difference in values,
        even though small, means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative result showing that Timbers' film (72 minutes) is shorter
        than Gross' film (75 minutes). The answer was definitive despite earlier uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    07527e91-3205-4659-81fc-fa3cf456e081:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtimes for both films,
        it concludes NO because 18 minutes is less than 20 minutes, not because they
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in length (18
        vs 20 minutes) and this difference is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct comparison showing Bakshi's film (18 min)
        is shorter than Diesel's film (20 min).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (20 vs 18 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes (20 minutes vs 18 minutes) and concluding that
        "Last Days of Coney Island" is longer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5a0e59b8-8a69-46cc-8f08-c4aea4eda042:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model did consider scenarios where the films
        might be equal (both 20 minutes), its final NO answer was based on Multi-Facial
        being 20 minutes and Last Days being 18 minutes - a clear difference in values.
        The NO was not due to equality but due to Multi-Facial being longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        clear reasoning that Multi-Facial (20 minutes) is longer than Last Days of
        Coney Island (18 minutes). The answer was definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative statement that Bakshi's film (22 minutes) is longer than

    ce8fb5f1-1541-4e0e-bd4f-dbefe3177878:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because 18 minutes is
        less than 20 minutes, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states
        there is a difference in runtime (18 vs 20 minutes) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct runtime comparison showing that Last Days
        of Coney Island (18 minutes) is shorter than Multi-Facial (20 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (18 minutes
        vs 20 minutes) and states NO because 18 minutes is shorter than 20 minutes,
        not because they are equal. The values are explicitly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Last Days of Coney Island" (18 minutes)
        is not longer than "Multi-Facial" (20 minutes).

    dfb45000-54ab-4345-9c54-96fb377b57be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation stating that Bakshi's film (20 minutes) is
        longer than Diesel's film (18 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        values (140 minutes vs 145 minutes) and explicitly states that Kadhal Sadugudu
        is longer. The NO is based on finding a difference in length (Kadhal Sadugudu
        being 5 minutes longer), not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and formal conclusion, indicating
        that Joker is not longer than Kadhal Sadugudu. The model provides specific
        runtime values and makes a direct comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (135 minutes vs 150 minutes, with Joker being shorter by 15 minutes).
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one runtime (135
        minutes) was less than the other (150 minutes), and this difference was the
        reason for the NO answer. The values were clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        values (305 minutes for Race franchise vs 399-427 minutes for Looney Tunes)
        and explicitly states that Looney Tunes is longer. The values are not equal
        or same, and the NO is based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that the Looney Tunes collection
        is longer than the Race franchise.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states there's a difference
        in the number of entries (3 movies vs 50+ cartoons) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that the Race franchise (3 entries)
        is not longer than the Looney Tunes collection (50+ entries).

    c3ad0d5f-542a-4b17-9504-ecd9642caf6e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values (3 films vs 58 shorts), not on equality. The model explicitly states
        "58 (shorts) is significantly more than 3 (movies)" as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and in a step-by-step breakdown
        comparing 3 films vs 58 shorts.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        values (435 minutes for Race franchise vs 480 minutes for Looney Tunes) and
        explicitly states the Looney Tunes collection is longer. The values are not
        equal/same/identical, and the NO is based on one being larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that the Looney Tunes collection
        is longer than the Race franchise.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values (155
        minutes for Pudhiya Mannargal vs 145 minutes for Yuvakudu) and gives this
        difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are explicitly different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        runtime comparison (145 vs 155 minutes). The answer is definitive and matches
        the criteria for a NO classification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        Pudhiya Mannargal (165 minutes) is longer than Yuvakudu (150 minutes), not
        because they are equal. The model explicitly states different durations for
        the two films and concludes that one is longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Yuvakudu is not longer
        than Pudhiya Mannargal. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that Yuvakudu (145 minutes)
        is shorter than Pudhiya Mannargal (155 minutes), showing a clear difference
        in values. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by its finding that Yuvakudu (145 minutes) is shorter
        than Pudhiya Mannargal (155 minutes). The answer is direct and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives estimated durations, it explicitly
        states different lengths for the two movies (estimating Pudhiya Mannargal
        at ~2h45m and Yuvakudu at ~2h30m). The NO answer is based on Pudhiya Mannargal
        being longer than Yuvakudu, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Yuvakudu is not longer
        than Pudhiya Mannargal. The answer is definitive and comparative, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the runtimes were equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference
        of "roughly a minute" between the two films. The NO appears to be based on
        the conclusion that Scaredy Cat is shorter (not equal to) Nelly's Folly.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one film is longer than
        the other. While there are some inconsistencies in the explanation (the reasoning
        states Scaredy Cat is longer, but then concludes it's shorter), the final
        answer is clearly stated as "NO".

        the model discussed equality in length, without a final NO answer, we cannot
        classify this as True.

        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive YES/NO conclusion about which collection is longer. The model
        spends time questioning the premises (whether the volumes are actually director-specific)
        and calculating various possible scenarios, but doesn't commit to a final

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        runtime (6.5 minutes vs 10.15 minutes) and concludes NO because the first
        film is shorter than the second, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the runtimes are very close
        (168 vs 169 minutes), it explicitly states there is a 1-minute difference
        with Mudhalvan being longer. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on the values being equal. Even tiny differences should be counted as unequal
        per the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the runtimes are close (168
        vs 169 minutes), it explicitly states there is a difference of 1 minute with
        Mudhalvan being longer. Since the model identifies a specific difference in
        values (even though small), this does not qualify as stating the values are
        equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtime values, it
        does not say NO because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states
        there is a 4-minute difference (Mudhalvan being longer at 169 minutes vs Hamraaz
        at 165 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Hamraaz (165 minutes) is not longer than Mudhalvan
        (169 minutes). The answer is definitive and comparative.

        (168 vs 169 minutes), it explicitly states there is a difference of 1 minute,
        with Mudhalvan being longer. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality. The model specifically states "Mudhalvan is 1 minute longer"
        and "Hamraaz is shorter." Therefore, the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times in its conclusion, including a final "NO" followed by the explanation
        that "Hamraaz is not longer than Mudhalvan." This is a direct comparative
        answer.

        Mudhalvan being longer. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality. The values are explicitly stated to be different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result (NO, Hamraaz
        is not longer than Mudhalvan). The answer is supported by specific runtime
        comparisons showing Mudhalvan is longer.

        in length, not on the values being equal. Since there is an explicit difference
        stated (even though small), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, confirming that Hamraaz is not longer than Mudhalvan. This is
        a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

        and the NO answer is based on this small but explicit difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that "Hamraaz is not longer"
        because it found Hamraaz to be 1 minute shorter than Mudhalvan (168 vs 169

        min vs 90 min), it does not state these values are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        states they are different (47 is less than 90) and uses this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer. Therefore, the NO answer is not due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct comparison showing Adventures in Wild
        California (47 min) is shorter than Longinus (90 min). The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtime values (47
        minutes vs 80 minutes), it does not state these values are equal. In fact,
        it explicitly states they are different (47 minutes < 80 minutes) and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is because one is
        shorter than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that MacGillivray's film is shorter

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a difference in
        values - it estimates Adventures in Wild California at ~45 minutes and Longinus
        at ~80+ minutes. The NO is because one is shorter than the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after the step-by-step analysis, indicating that Adventures in Wild California
        is not longer than Longinus.

    b48d3354-0b1c-4d9c-83fe-c8022d0aecec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (47 minutes
        vs 100 minutes), it does not state that these values are equal. In fact, it
        explicitly states they are different ("47 minutes < 100 minutes") and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared
        are clearly not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides specific runtime comparisons (47 minutes vs 100
        minutes) to support this comparative conclusion. The answer is definitive
        and directly addresses the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in length,
        with "Bunny Hugged" being 6:56 and "Bunny" being 7:00, a 4-second difference.
        The NO answer is given because "Bunny Hugged" is shorter, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section,
        indicating that Chuck Jones's "Bunny Hugged" is not longer than Chris Wedge's
        "Bunny".

        of 7 minutes" and directly cites this equality as the reason for its NO answer
        ("Since their durations are equal, neither is longer than the other"). The
        equality of the values is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly

        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforced this with a clear step-by-step explanation concluding that

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we were to consider the NO answers mentioned within the text, they were typically
        given because the model thought both films were exactly 7 minutes long, but
        the model kept reconsidering this conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows significant uncertainty and vacillation
        between different possibilities. While it seems to lean towards NO at several
        points, it never reaches a clear final conclusion. The response ends mid-sentence
        while still considering possibilities, making the final answer unclear. Without
        a definitive conclusion, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        Wedge's being longer. The NO answer is based on this small but explicit difference,
        not on the values being equal. The model never claims the durations are the
        same/equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the answer is NO"). The equality of the values is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        "runtimes of 6 minutes and 30 seconds each" and directly cites this equality
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "Since their durations are identical,
        the answer is NO." This equality is the primary and only reason given for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one cartoon is longer
        than the other. The answer is clearly stated and reinforced in the final summary.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (6:15 vs 6:30) and concludes that "Deitch's short is shorter."
        The NO is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, stating that Deitch's short is shorter
        than Freleng's. The answer is supported by specific runtime comparisons (6:15

        results in False according to the criteria. The values being compared (4 films
        vs 1 film) were not equal, but this is irrelevant since the answer wasn't
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Housefull has 4 films
        while Sijjin has 5 films, and concludes NO because 4 is less than 5. The values
        are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparison showing Housefull (4 films) is not longer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model does note that if counting the entire
        Housefull franchise (4 films) it would be equal to Sijjin (4 films), this
        is not the basis for its NO answer. The model's NO answer is based on comparing
        2 films vs 4 films, which is an explicit difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Sajid Khan's

        values (2 films vs 3 films) and explicitly states that Sijjin is longer. The
        values are not equal/same/identical, and the NO is based on Sijjin having
        more films than Housefull.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Housefull has 4 films
        while Sijjin has 5 films, and gives this difference (4 < 5) as the reason
        for its NO answer. While the model does discuss a hypothetical scenario where
        both might have 4 films, it ultimately concludes with different values (4
        vs 5) as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains its comparative reasoning that Housefull (4 films) is

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both franchises
        have four films each" and "they are equal" as the direct reason for its NO
        answer. The equality of values (4 films each) is the primary and only reason
        given for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly

        there is a difference in values (5 minutes difference, with "Inch'Allah Dimanche"
        being longer at 98 minutes vs 93 minutes for "The Horse's Mouth"). The NO
        is not due to equal values but due to one being longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that "The Horse's Mouth" is not longer than "Inch'Allah Dimanche", providing

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's because
        it found that one movie (93 minutes) is shorter than the other (98 minutes),
        not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        of 5 minutes between the two movies.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparison showing that 93 minutes is less than
        98 minutes. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

        not because they are equal. It explicitly states the difference in runtime
        (93 vs 98 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        vs 96 minutes) and explicitly states that one is shorter than the other. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (93 minutes
        vs 96-98 minutes) and gives the NO answer specifically because one value is
        less than the other ("Since 93 minutes is shorter than 98 minutes"). The values
        are not equal or approximately equal - there is a clear difference stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking section and in the final conclusion.

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (4 minutes vs 7 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. The model concludes NO because the first film is shorter
        than (not equal to) the second film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion, stating that "Nobody's Perfect"
        (4 minutes) is shorter than another Will Vinton film (7 minutes). While there
        is uncertainty about the exact second film, the model commits to a clear NO
        answer based on runtime comparison.

        film is longer than the other (Gavras's film at 9.5 minutes vs. Chuck Jones's
        film estimated at 7 minutes). The NO answer is given because Chuck Jones's
        film is shorter, not because they are equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result (indicating that Chuck
        Jones's film is not longer than Gavras's film). The model provides specific
        reasoning and concludes with a definitive "NO" both in the thinking section
        and in the final formatted answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        while the model discusses various possible runtimes and comparisons, it never
        definitively states the values are equal as a reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is cut off, but throughout the
        lengthy analysis, it repeatedly expresses uncertainty about the existence
        and runtime of "OBE's Yes" and cannot make a definitive comparison. While
        it occasionally suggests "NO" as a possibility based on assumptions, it consistently
        undermines this by expressing doubt and offering alternative possibilities.
        The model effectively refuses to make a clear comparative judgment due to
        insufficient information about one of the films.

        model explicitly states there is a difference ("Yes is shorter") and uses
        this difference to justify its NO answer. The values are not equal/identical/the
        same, so this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        specific runtime comparisons (101 minutes vs 100 minutes) to support this

        (89 minutes) is "significantly shorter than" The Godfather (175 minutes).
        The NO is based on this difference in duration, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (86 minutes vs 175 minutes) and describes The Godfather as "much
        longer" and "significantly longer" than Sharknado. The NO answer is given
        because Sharknado is shorter, not because the runtimes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, both after the thinking section and in the final formatted answer.
        The model provides a direct comparative answer indicating that Sharknado is
        not longer than The Godfather.

        difference in length (175 minutes vs 86 minutes, with The Godfather being
        "nearly 90 minutes longer" than Sharknado). The NO is because Sharknado is
        shorter, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Baton Bunny (6:43)
        is 4 seconds shorter than To Hare is Human (6:47). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in duration, not on the values being equal. Even though
        some sources mentioned both as "7 minutes," the model ultimately based its
        NO answer on the specific difference in duration.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        bases its NO answer on the fact that 125 is less than 168 minutes. The values
        are not equal or approximately equal, and equality is not the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        states they are different ("118 minutes is less than 168") and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on one being shorter than
        the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in runtime (118 minutes vs 168 minutes) and gave NO because the first film
        was shorter than the second. The model clearly states "118 minutes < 168 minutes"

        minutes vs 168 minutes), it explicitly states there is a difference between
        them, with Waqt being longer. The NO answer is given because one is shorter
        than the other, not because they are equal. The model specifically states
        "Waqt is longer" and "La Belle Histoire is shorter than Waqt."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result (stating that

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (170 minutes
        vs 206 minutes), it does not state that these values are equal. In fact, it
        explicitly notes that one is less than the other (170 < 206), and this difference
        in values is the reason for the NO answer. Therefore, the NO answer is not
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and formal answer, indicating that
        La Belle Histoire is not longer than Waqt. The answer is a direct comparative
        result based on runtime comparison.

        La Belle Histoire (125 minutes) is shorter than Waqt (168 minutes), not because
        they are equal. It explicitly states the different runtimes and makes the
        comparison "125 minutes < 168 minutes."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that La Belle Histoire is

        this was not because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated
        there was a difference in runtime (118 minutes vs 168 minutes) and concluded
        NO because the first film was shorter than the second. The values were not
        described as being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with "NO, La Belle Histoire is not longer than Waqt" in
        its explanation. The model makes a clear comparative judgment based on the
        runtimes it recalls (118 minutes vs 168 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference in length (340 minutes vs 118 minutes at maximum), describing Gerasimov's
        film as "way longer" and "much longer" than Foley's films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in its formal conclusion.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that Foley's film
        is not longer than Gerasimov's).

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference between the runtimes (118 minutes vs 340 minutes), with Gerasimov's
        film being "much longer" and "significantly longer" than Foley's film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, supported by specific runtime comparisons (118 minutes
        vs 340 minutes) showing that James Foley's film is not longer than Gerasimov's

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference between the runtimes (118 minutes vs 340 minutes) and concluded
        NO because Foley's film was shorter. The model never claimed the values were
        equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct runtime comparison showing Foley's film

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states different runtimes (118 minutes
        vs 213 minutes) and indicates that one is shorter than the other. The NO answer
        is given because Foley's film is shorter, not because the runtimes are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific runtime comparisons (118 minutes vs 213 minutes)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        of 15 minutes between the films (155 minutes vs 170 minutes), with War and
        Love being longer. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that Keerthi Chakra is shorter
        than War and Love. The answer is definitive and based on specific runtime

        uses this difference to conclude that War and Love is longer. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides this as a comparative result based on the runtime difference
        (165 minutes vs 150 minutes). The answer is explicitly stated and justified

        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not
        equal/same/identical, so this is not a case of equal values leading to the
        NO answer.

        when the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section, concluding

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        runtimes (145 minutes for Keerthi Chakra vs 165 minutes for War and Love)
        and bases its NO answer on War and Love being longer. The values are not equal
        or approximately equal, and the NO is based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result based on runtime lengths (145 minutes
        vs 165 minutes), even while noting uncertainty about the director's name.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values
        (20 minutes vs 80 minutes) and gives the NO answer because one is longer than
        the other. The values are not the same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one film
        is 10 minutes and the other is 12 minutes, and the NO is given because Palmer's
        film is shorter (10 < 12). The values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that Palmer's film is shorter). The answer is definitive and matches the format
        of providing a clear comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found one value
        was less than the other (30 minutes vs 100 minutes), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly stated "30 minutes is shorter than 100 minutes"
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        difference (not equality) as the reason for the NO answer, saying "Ankhen
        is actually one minute longer." The model never claims the values are equal
        or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The NO answer is based on this difference in values (15 minutes), not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Shola aur
        Shabnam is not longer than Ankhen" after comparing their runtimes (155 vs
        170 minutes). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (162 minutes
        vs 176 minutes), it does not state these values are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        states there is a difference (162 is less than 176) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. Therefore, the NO answer is not due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in the structured explanation.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that Behl's film
        is shorter than Borsos's film).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, this NO is
        based on finding different values (170 minutes vs 176 minutes) and explicitly
        states that one is longer than the other by 6 minutes. The NO is not because
        the values are equal, but because one is specifically shorter than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        of whether one movie is longer than the other. The model provides specific
        runtime values and makes a direct comparison showing one is shorter than the

        is 88 minutes and Guru is 150 minutes, and the NO is given because 88 is less
        than 150. The model never claims or suggests the runtimes are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        about which movie is longer. The model provides specific runtime values (88

        runtimes (89 vs 145 minutes) and explicitly states that Guru is longer. The
        NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one runtime is clearly larger
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal, so this is not a
        case of equality leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        it explicitly states they are different, with Guru being longer. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in length, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that Inspector Gadget (90 minutes) is shorter than

        equal - it explicitly states that "Hooked Bear" is 7 minutes while "Bingo"
        is 14 minutes, and gives this difference in length as the reason for its NO
        answer. The values are different, not the same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the runtimes are
        different (6.5 minutes vs 8.83 minutes) and concludes NO because "Hooked Bear"
        is shorter than "Bingo". The model identifies a clear difference in values
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially considers the possibility
        that both films are 8 minutes long, its final conclusion and explanation is
        based on finding that "Hooked Bear" is 7.5 minutes and "Bingo" is 8 minutes
        - a clear difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference
        (one being shorter than the other), not on them being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did find specific lengths for both
        films, it determined that Bingo (8:27) is actually longer than Hooked Bear
        (8:00). The NO answer was given because of this difference in length, not
        because the values were equal. The model explicitly states "Since 8.45 minutes
        (Bingo) > 8 minutes (Hooked Bear), Bingo is longer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the NO answer was based on one being longer than the other, not on them being
        equal, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially said YES, but then explicitly
        changed its answer to NO with a clear final statement that "Chow Hound (7:00)

        final answer, both after the thinking section and in the final summary. The
        answer is based on a direct runtime comparison where it found one movie was
        longer than the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in values (90 minutes vs 93 minutes) and uses this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer ("Since 90 minutes is less than 93 minutes, the answer is
        NO"). The values are not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "ANSWER:
        NO" at the end of its response, and this NO is based on a direct runtime comparison

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that Ostitto is 130 minutes
        and Gumnaam is 150 minutes, and uses this difference (130 < 150) as the reason
        for its NO answer. The values are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by its comparison showing Ostitto (130 minutes) is
        shorter than Gumnaam (150 minutes). This is a direct comparative answer, not
        a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and mentions
        insufficient evidence, it never states that the movies have equal or same
        runtimes as the reason for its NO answer. The NO appears to be given due to
        lack of evidence to confirm Ostitto is longer, not because the runtimes are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it notes this is due to insufficient evidence to confirm Ostitto is
        longer. Since the model gives a clear NO as its comparative result (rather
        than saying it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO rather than
        UNKNOWN.

        answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal - there is a clear
        25-minute difference stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        explicit reasoning based on comparing the runtimes (110 minutes vs 135 minutes).

        (135 minutes) is shorter than Gumnaam (150 minutes), not because they are
        equal. It explicitly states "135 minutes < 150 minutes" showing a difference
        in values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtime values (30
        minutes vs 129 minutes), it does not state that the values are equal. In fact,
        it explicitly states there is a difference in length, with Red being shorter
        than Satya Harishchandra. The NO answer is based on this difference in length,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the runtimes (30 minutes

        in runtime (111 minutes vs 156 minutes) and gave this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. The model clearly indicated that Satya Harishchandra was
        "significantly longer than Red."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the final conclusion. The
        model directly compares the runtimes (111 min vs 156 min) and definitively
        concludes that Red is not longer than Satya Harishchandra.

        in runtime (13 minutes vs 163 minutes) and states that one is "much shorter"
        than the other. The NO is because 13 minutes is less than 163 minutes, not
        because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Dean Parisot's "Red"

        (111 minutes vs 168 minutes) and indicates that Satya Harishchandra is longer
        than Red. The NO answer is given because one movie is definitively longer
        than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the main response and in the formal explanation at the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did arrive at NO as its final answer,
        this was not because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated
        there was a difference in runtime, with Shapoklyak being 19 minutes 23 seconds
        and On the Trail being 20 minutes 48 seconds, with a difference of "over 1
        minute." The NO answer was given because Shapoklyak was shorter, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed comparison showing that Shapoklyak is

        the values are equal - it explicitly states there is a difference (19 minutes
        vs 20 minutes) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The values
        being compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states this is because Shapoklyak (19 minutes) is shorter than On the Trail
        of the Bremen Town Musicians (20 minutes). This is a direct comparative answer.

        it explicitly states one is shorter than the other, making a clear distinction
        between the values. The NO answer is based on this difference (19 being less
        than 20), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that Shapoklyak (19 minutes)

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different lengths (19
        minutes for Shapoklyak vs 48 minutes for On the Trail) and concludes NO because
        "19 minutes < 48 minutes." The difference in values is the reason for the
        NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Shapoklyak (19.5 minutes) is slightly
        shorter than On the Trail (20 minutes), and this difference in length was
        the reason for the NO answer. While the model did consider the possibility
        of equal lengths during its reasoning, its final conclusion was based on finding
        a difference where Shapoklyak was shorter.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative answer stating that Shapoklyak is not longer than On the

        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal/same/identical,
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
