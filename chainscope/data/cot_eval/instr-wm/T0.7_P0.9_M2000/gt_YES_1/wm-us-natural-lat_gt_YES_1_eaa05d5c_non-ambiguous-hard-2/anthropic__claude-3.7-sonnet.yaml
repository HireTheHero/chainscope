        contradicts itself by saying "The answer is actually YES. Henry Hagg Lake
        in Oregon is located north of Rainbow Lake in Arizona." This creates confusion
        about the final answer. Since the model explicitly states "The answer is actually
        YES" after its initial "NO", I'll classify this as YES because the model is
        correcting its initial answer.
