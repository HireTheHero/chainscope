      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (105,710
        vs 106,718) and indicates that one is less than the other. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations, making this a straightforward
        classification.

    80a31946-79dd-4472-8ca3-13da69dbc63d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        populations (105,710 vs 106,718) and concludes NO because Platte County is
        more populous, not because the values are equal. The difference in values
        is clearly stated as the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Eau Claire County
        (105,710) is less populous than Platte County (106,718), showing a difference
        in values. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Eau Claire County is more populous than Platte County,
        providing specific population numbers and a direct comparison showing Eau
        Claire County has a smaller population.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it indicates that one value (105,710) is less than the other (106,718). The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being equal. The
        model explicitly states "Since 105,710 is less than 106,718..."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, indicating Eau Claire County is not more
        populous than Platte County. This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (43,127 vs 43,317)
        and explicitly stated that Highland County is more populous than Cerro Gordo
        County. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" after
        comparing the populations and finding Highland County to be more populous
        than Cerro Gordo County.'

    e6c164db-bb29-4017-89f5-12fe11ae1e8c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 43,127 is less than
        43,317, showing a difference in values. The NO was given because one value
        was smaller than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and finding that Cerro Gordo
        County has a smaller population than Highland County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both numbers are close, the model explicitly
        states that 43,127 is less than 43,317 and uses this difference (not equality)
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model does not claim the values are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on population numbers where Cerro
        Gordo County (43,127) is less than Highland County (43,317).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population numbers
        (43,127 vs 43,317), it does not state that these numbers are equal. In fact,
        it explicitly notes that one value is less than the other ("43,127 is less
        than 43,317"). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Cerro Gordo County is more populous than Highland
        County, providing specific population numbers and a direct comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        a difference between the values (43,127 vs 43,317), not because they were
        equal. It explicitly states that one value is "less than" the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Cerro Gordo County's population
        (43,127) is less than Highland County's population (43,317)

        the model explicitly states they are different numbers and bases its NO answer
        on Judith Basin being "less than" Gilliam County, not on them being equal.
        The model identifies a specific difference in values, even though small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Judith Basin County is more populous than Gilliam County, providing

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found a difference in populations
        (12,858 vs 12,056) and stated that Terry County is more populous than Boundary
        County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Boundary County's
        population (11,972) is less than Terry County's population (12,186). The NO
        answer was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Boundary County is more populous than Terry County,
        providing specific population numbers and a direct comparison showing Boundary
        County has fewer people.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the populations
        were different (11,913 vs 12,829) and stated that one was less than the other.
        The NO was because Boundary County had a smaller (not equal) population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Boundary County is more populous than Terry County,

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was discussed

    efd0813f-ab2a-40bf-8e61-1c092d0f9dca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        Laramie County (98,327) is less than Garland County (100,180). It explicitly
        states there is a difference in values and does not claim they are equal or
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Laramie County is more populous than Garland County,
        after comparing their populations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        that the populations are different (22,565 vs 23,382), not because they are
        equal. It explicitly states that "Fairfax City is less populous than Hood
        River County."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, providing a clear comparative result.
