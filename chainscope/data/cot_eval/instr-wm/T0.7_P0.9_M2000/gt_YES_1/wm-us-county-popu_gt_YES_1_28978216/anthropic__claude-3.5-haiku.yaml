      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the populations
        were different (52,867 vs 49,617) and stated that "Venango County is more
        populous than Oktibbeha County".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Venango County (52,867) is

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations (51,000 vs 52,000) and says "Oktibbeha County has slightly
        fewer people than Venango County." The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that "Oktibbeha County is NOT more populous"

      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are close (51,000 vs 52,000),
        the model explicitly states that "Venango County is slightly more populous
        than Oktibbeha County" and gives this difference as the reason for the NO
        answer, not their equality. Any stated difference, even if small, means this
        should be classified as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Mendocino County
        (91,000) is "slightly smaller than" Victoria County (92,000). Since it identifies
        a difference in values, even though small, this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.

        Parish using the ">" symbol.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Beauregard Parish is more populous than Matagorda
        County, after showing that Matagorda County has a larger population.

        there is a difference in population (Matagorda County is "slightly more populous")
        and provides different values (35,654 vs 36,702). The NO is not due to equal
        values but due to Matagorda having a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result showing Matagorda County is more
        populous than Beauregard Parish.

        County is more populous than Beauregard Parish". The NO was not due to equal
        values, but due to a clear difference in population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding Matagorda County (36,702) is larger than Beauregard
        Parish (31,583). This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are close (10,200 vs 10,469),
        the model explicitly states that "Sabine County has slightly more people than
        Keokuk County" and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Keokuk County is more populous than Sabine County, providing specific

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly showed
        that the values are different (59,626 vs 62,259) and stated "59,626 is less
        than 62,259". The NO was not based on equal values, but rather on a clear
        difference between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding that Sandusky County has a smaller population
        than Otsego County. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (59,626
        vs 62,259) and states that one is less than the other. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly stated
        there was a difference in population ("Otsego County is slightly larger, with
        about 2,633 more people"). The NO was not due to equal values, but due to
        a specific difference being identified.

        that Otsego County (62,195) is "slightly more populous" than Sandusky County
        (59,626). The NO is based on this difference in values, not on them being
        equal.

        is "slightly larger than" Boundary County (12,000) and notes this difference.
        The NO answer is not based on the values being equal - in fact, the model
        specifically identifies a difference in population. Therefore, while the final
        answer was NO, it was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

        the model explicitly states that Terry County is "slightly more populous"
        than Boundary County. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response and explicitly explains that Terry County has more people than
        Boundary County, making this a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed different values
        (53,488 vs 57,225) and stated "57,225 is larger than 53,488". Since the model
        showed a clear difference in values, this cannot be classified as a NO due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its own analysis which shows Jessamine County
        is more populous. Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit final answer
        rather than resolve contradictions, we classify this as NO.

        (35 people), it explicitly states there is a difference with Blount County
        being "slightly more populous" and "technically larger." Since any difference,
        even if described as small, means the values are not equal, this cannot be
        classified as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it explicitly states that "Cayuga County is slightly more populous than Clallam
        County" - indicating a difference in values, not equality. The NO answer is
        based on this difference (76,576 vs 75,402), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Clallam County is more populous than Cayuga County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (25,189
        vs 26,460) and states "Barton County is slightly more populous" - while the
        final answer is NO, it's because there is a difference in values, not because
        they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (25,189
        vs 26,643) and states that one is greater than the other. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, stating that Morehouse
        Parish is NOT more populous than Barton County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference of 1,453 people between the populations, showing they
        are not equal. The NO is based on Barton County being larger, not on the values
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Barton County is larger than
        Morehouse Parish by 1,453 people.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it shows they are different (25,189 vs 26,460) and explicitly states that
        "26,460 is greater than 25,189". The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, after showing that Barton County (26,460) has
        a larger population than Morehouse Parish (25,189).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are different (191,000 vs 290,000)
        and notes that "290,000 is greater than 191,000". While the NO answer appears
        inconsistent with this reasoning, the values are clearly stated as different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, despite its reasoning suggesting Thurston County is more populous
