      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the values are close (105,000 vs 106,000), the
        model explicitly states there is a difference ("Platte County, MO is slightly
        more populous") and this difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Platte County (106,000) is
        slightly more populous than Eau Claire County (105,000)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1ee7d329-f37b-43a9-9c50-f7061926a5fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While comparing the populations, the model explicitly
        states that Platte County's population (106,718) is "slightly higher than"
        Eau Claire County's population (105,710). Since it identifies a difference
        in values, even though small, this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Eau Claire County,
        WI is not more populous than Platte County, MO" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    24a72921-ea5d-4f8f-8327-74028211e812:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Eau Claire County
        (105,000) has a lower population than Platte County (110,000), showing a clear
        difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Eau Claire County, WI
        is not more populous than Platte County, MO" as its final answer, providing
        a direct comparative result with specific population numbers (105,000 vs 110,000).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    74118cc6-a5ee-4132-ad6e-a4c13434c230:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population numbers
        (105,000 vs 107,000), it does not indicate that these values are equal. In
        fact, it shows a difference of 2,000 people between the counties. The NO answer
        is based on Platte County having a larger population, not because the values
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly indicating that Eau Claire County is not more populous than Platte
        County. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    782378a3-ff86-4310-9b22-7b6db8f5fc7b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both numbers are close (105,000 vs 107,000),
        the model explicitly states different values and bases its NO answer on Platte
        County having a larger population (107,000 > 105,000), not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Eau Claire County, WI is not more populous
        than Platte County, MO" based on comparing specific population values.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    93dedd05-29b5-493f-97be-f1eb8b2d7209:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it does not indicate the populations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states
        different values (105,710 vs 106,718) and concludes that "Platte County, MO
        is more populous than Eau Claire County, WI." The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Platte County is more
        populous than Eau Claire County. This is a direct comparative answer to whether
        Eau Claire County is more populous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bb7d798f-ec75-44b2-9374-3339f7cea398:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it explicitly notes that Platte County has a slightly higher population
        (106,000) than Eau Claire County (105,000). The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Eau Claire County,
        WI is not more populous than Platte County, MO" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bef53ae3-be3f-41d7-95bc-5f9101068510:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states different values (105,000 vs 110,000) and
        indicates that Platte County is more populous than Eau Claire County. The
        NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Platte County is more populous
        than Eau Claire County. This is a direct comparative answer to whether Eau
        Claire County is more populous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c4349d1b-af9e-4182-95d4-fea71c93bc33:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (105,000
        vs 110,000) and explicitly states that "Platte County is more populous than
        Eau Claire County." The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Eau Claire County, WI
        is not more populous than Platte County, MO" as its final answer. This is
        an explicit NO comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ed5e6368-f03f-47a7-ba1c-6be4cbbf7092:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's because Platte
        County (106,718) has a larger population than Eau Claire County (104,646),
        not because the values are equal. The model explicitly shows different population
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly shows that Eau Claire County (104,646) is not more populous
        than Platte County (106,718)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    4482e106-d687-45ee-9c57-3dc03bf80dbf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (51,788 vs
        50,454).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and finding Oktibbeha County's population to be larger than
        Venango County's population.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    47963631-8345-495d-856b-df9b8320e14e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, while the model noted the populations
        were "similar," it stated one was "slightly more populous," not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **YES**"
        and concludes that Oktibbeha County is more populous than Venango County.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    62dbcc76-a2b7-436f-9a98-42eaca390586:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly notes that "Venango County, PA, has a slightly higher
        population than Oktibbeha County, MS" (49,000 vs 50,000). The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Oktibbeha County,
        MS, is not more populous than Venango County, PA" as its final answer, providing
        a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    71718da7-7285-47ac-b3dc-82106dabd889:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both populations are close (49,000 vs 50,000),
        the model explicitly notes a difference between them, with Venango County
        having a higher population. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Oktibbeha County is not more populous than Venango
        County. The answer is direct and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7791876d-d9fd-457c-8dda-f6aafc2922e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The actual comparison of values
        is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, making this a clear YES answer despite noting similarities
        in population earlier in the analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    859f3795-7f60-4846-893d-2754a1af36a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal
        - it specifically states Venango County has approximately 50,000 people while
        Oktibbeha County has approximately 49,000 people, describing Venango as "slightly
        more populous." Since it identifies a difference in values (even though small),
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Oktibbeha County is more populous than Venango County, providing
        specific population numbers and explicitly stating "Based on this analysis,
        the answer to the question is NO."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    873f110c-56ab-48b1-9eb3-d4ec0dff9c68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both counties have "approximately
        50,000 people" and are "similar," it explicitly mentions that there could
        be "slight variations" and that "the answer could vary slightly depending
        on the most current data." Since it acknowledges potential differences rather
        than stating they are exactly equal, and bases its NO on lack of definitive
        evidence rather than equality, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Oktibbeha County,
        MS is not definitively more populous than Venango County, PA" as its final
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b857a0bb-e5ba-4e53-8fdf-339ed8246b84:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: **YES**" after determining that Oktibbeha County is slightly more
        populous than Venango County.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed since
        it only applies to NO answers.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values question only needs
        to be evaluated for NO answers.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that they have "similar populations"
        of "approximately 25,000 people," it explicitly states that "Uvalde County
        has a slightly larger population than Payette County." Since it indicates
        a difference (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Payette County, ID

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted that both counties have "similar
        population ranges," it explicitly stated that "Uvalde County tends to have
        a slightly higher population than Payette County." Since it indicated a difference
        (even if slight) rather than exact equality as the reason for the NO answer,
        this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Payette County,
        ID is not more populous than Uvalde County, TX" as a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Even if we had considered the tentative
        "likely be 'NO'" as a final NO answer, the model notes the populations are
        "similar" and "comparable" but doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it mentions "it would likely be 'NO'", it heavily qualifies this by
        saying "this is not certain without the latest specific data" and emphasizes
        that "it's not possible to definitively say." This indicates uncertainty rather
        than a definitive answer.

        there is a difference in populations ("Dickens County, TX, generally has a
        slightly higher population than Taliaferro County, GA"). The NO is not due
        to equal values, but rather because Dickens County has a higher population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mendocino County is more populous than Victoria County, providing
        a clear comparative result based on population numbers (91,000 vs 92,000).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        did note equal populations of around 90,000, this is irrelevant since the
        question only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the YES or NO question
        cannot be answered conclusively" and does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it indicates that "neither county is definitively more populous than
        the other." This constitutes a refusal to make a definitive comparison.

        (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.

        this is not a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        more populous than Beauregard Parish, LA." Even though the difference is described
        as slight, any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Beauregard Parish, LA
        is not more populous than Matagorda County, TX" as its final answer. This
        is an explicit NO in response to the comparative question.

        recent data might show slight differences" and doesn't explicitly state they
        are exactly equal. The possibility of differences, even if slight, means this
        isn't a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Beauregard Parish,

        equal or identical. Instead, it notes they are "somewhat comparable" but explicitly
        states that "Matagorda County generally tends to have a slightly higher population."
        Since it indicates a difference (even if described as slight), this does not
        qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO; Beauregard Parish,
        LA is not more populous than Matagorda County, TX" as its final comparative

        of approximately 36,000" but then notes that "slight differences in estimates
        might mean one is slightly more populous than the other." Since it acknowledges
        potential differences rather than declaring them exactly equal, and bases
        its NO on inability to determine rather than equality, this does not qualify
        as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Beauregard
        Parish, LA is not definitively more populous than Matagorda County, TX." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        the model does not explicitly state they are equal/same/identical. Instead,
        it presents them as different ranges with Matagorda County having a slightly
        higher range, which implies a difference rather than equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        it identifies a difference in values, even though described as slight, this
        should be classified as False
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        a larger population (10,500) than Keokuk County (10,000). The NO answer was
        based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly indicating that Keokuk County is not more populous than Sabine
        County. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

        the populations rather than stating they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer leans towards

        a difference (even if slight), this is not a case where equality is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, LaSalle Parish,
        LA is not more populous than Renville County, MN." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fccd1009-25d2-4287-877c-85e0c821a2ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (14,000
        vs 14,500) and concludes that LaSalle Parish is "less populous" than Renville
        County. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the populations, indicating LaSalle Parish
        is not more populous than Renville County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Durham County
        (330,000) has a slightly larger population than Fayette County (320,000),
        not because they are equal. The model explicitly notes this difference in
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fayette County, KY
        is not more populous than Durham County, NC" as its final answer, providing
        a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are close (322,000 vs 324,000),
        the model explicitly states Durham County is "slightly more populous" and
        gives specific different values. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fayette County, KY
        is not more populous than Durham County, NC" as its final answer, providing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the populations are "relatively
        close" and "quite similar," it explicitly states there is a difference with
        Durham County "edges out slightly." Since it indicates a difference exists
        (even if slight), this does not qualify as stating the values are exactly
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation following it. While there is some inconsistency
        in the explanation (saying Fayette "has slightly higher" but then concluding
        Durham "edges out slightly"), the final answer is clearly stated as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Durham County (330,000)
        has a larger population than Fayette County (320,000), showing a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Fayette County is more populous than Durham County, after comparing
        their populations (320,000 vs 330,000) and finding Durham County to be larger.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Durham County has a "slightly higher population
        than Fayette County" and gives approximate ranges showing Durham (320,000-330,000)
        as higher than Fayette. The NO answer is based on Durham being larger, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fayette County, KY
        is not more populous than Durham County, NC" as its final answer. This is
        a clear comparative NO response.

        populations (320,000 vs 330,000) and indicates Durham County has a higher
        population. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Durham County has a higher
        population than Fayette County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates Durham County's population (330,000)
        is slightly larger than Fayette County's (320,000). Since it notes a difference
        in values rather than equality, and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fayette County, KY
        is not more populous than Durham County, NC" as its final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both counties are described as having "over
        300,000" population, the model explicitly states that Durham County has a
        "slightly larger population." This indicates the values are not equal, and
        this difference (even though small) is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Fayette County,
        KY is not more populous than Durham County, NC" after stating that Durham
        County has a slightly larger population.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Durham County (330,000) is "slightly
        more populous" than Fayette County (320,000), showing a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Fayette County is more populous than Durham County, providing specific
        population numbers and explicitly stating that Durham County is slightly more
        populous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it indicates that Durham County has a larger population than
        Fayette County ("Durham County, NC generally has a larger population than
        Fayette County, KY"). The NO answer is based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Fayette County is not more populous than Durham County.
        The answer is clear and direct.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both counties have "approximately
        58,000" population and describes them as having "similar populations." The
        NO answer is directly based on their populations being the same/similar, making
        this the primary reason for the negative comparison.

        58,000 people," it then states that "Otsego County has had a slightly higher
        population than Sandusky County." Since it indicates a difference in population
        (even if slight), this is not a case where the NO answer is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Sandusky
        County, OH is not more populous than Otsego County, NY." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        primary reason for its NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any specific
        difference in values, only noting that there might be "slight variations"
        in current data. The equality of the populations is presented as the main
        basis for the conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Sandusky
        County, OH is not significantly more populous than Otsego County, NY." While

        they are exactly equal. The model mentions populations can "vary slightly"
        and uses ranges (12,000 to 13,000) for both. Since exact equality is not stated
        as the reason for the NO answer, and slight variations are mentioned, this
        does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Boundary

        population ("Contra Costa County's population is also over 1 million, generally
        higher than Salt Lake County's" and "Historically and based on recent estimates,
        Contra Costa County has had a larger population"). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Salt Lake County,
        UT is not more populous than Contra Costa County, CA." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        17,000 people" and describes them as "roughly similar in size" and "quite
        close." The NO answer appears to be primarily based on this equality, as indicated
        by "given the similarity" leading to the conclusion. The model doesn't indicate
        any difference in values, only their approximate equality.

        UT" - indicating a difference exists, even if small. Since it indicates a
        difference rather than exact equality, this doesn't qualify as equal values
        being the reason for the NO.

        figures" (approximately 55,000 people each) and uses this equality as the
        primary reason for its NO answer. The mention of "slight variations depending
        on the most recent data updates" doesn't indicate a clear difference between
        the values, but rather uncertainty about the exact numbers. The NO answer
        is explicitly based on "neither county is definitively more populous than
        the other given the similar population sizes."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be NO"
        and bases this on the populations being similar. While it expresses some uncertainty
        about precise figures, it does provide a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        a difference (even if slight), this is not a case where the NO answer was
        given because the values are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Pearl River

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the populations are "quite
        similar" and both in the range of "11,000 to 12,000 residents," it explicitly
        states that Heard County is "slightly larger." The NO answer appears to be
        based on the lack of significant difference rather than exact equality. Since
        it identifies a difference (even if small), this does not qualify as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Heard County, GA is not significantly more populous than Live
        Oak County, TX. While it adds a qualification about being "slightly larger,"
        it still provides a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        "slightly more populous than Heard County" and gives different population
        ranges (11-12k vs 12-13k). The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both counties have "relatively
        similar population sizes" (11,000-12,000), it explicitly states that "Live
        Oak County, TX, has a slightly higher population than Heard County, GA." Since
        it indicates a difference in values, even though slight, this is not a case
        of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Heard County, GA,
        is not more populous than Live Oak County, TX" as its final answer. This is
        a clear comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (11,412
        vs 12,207) and indicates Live Oak County has a larger population. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Heard County, GA
        is not more populous than Live Oak County, TX" as its final comparative answer,
        with clear population numbers showing Live Oak County has a larger population.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "Live Oak County, TX, has
        a slightly higher population than Heard County, GA." Even though the difference
        is described as "slight," any stated difference means this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically stating "NO. Heard County, GA is not more populous than Live
        Oak County, TX." This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values for the
        populations (11,834 vs 12,207) and states that Live Oak County is more populous
        than Heard County. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO. Heard County, GA, is not more populous than Live Oak County,
        TX." This is an explicit NO answer to a comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - it explicitly says Heard County "has a smaller population compared
        to Live Oak County." Since it indicates a difference in values (smaller vs
        larger) rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Heard County, GA
        is not more populous than Live Oak County, TX" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values (11,000
        vs 12,000), it does not state that these values are equal. In fact, it shows
        a difference in population (Live Oak County has 1,000 more people), which
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Heard County is more populous than Live Oak County.
        This is a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states that Lyman County
        has a "smaller population" than Cavalier County, indicating a difference in
        values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        "approximately 3,800 people," it then specifies that "Cavalier County has
        slightly more residents than Lyman County." Since it indicates a difference
        (even if small), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the
        NO answer.

        populations" of "approximately 3,700," it then states that "Cavalier County
        has had a slightly higher population." Since it indicates there is a difference
        (even if slight), this is not a case where the NO answer is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lyman County, SD
        is not more populous than Cavalier County, ND" as its final answer. While
        it notes similar populations, it makes a clear comparative judgment with NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While both numbers are close (3,700 vs 3,800), the
        model does not state they are equal or the same. Instead, it shows a clear
        difference in values with Cavalier County having 100 more people, and this
        difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lyman County, SD

    5c7fe741-4a55-4fd7-9733-ca5eee4f13a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both counties have "similar populations"
        and "roughly similar" estimates of "16,000 to 17,000" but also mentions "potential
        for small variations" and that "specific numbers may vary slightly." Since
        it acknowledges potential differences rather than stating they are exactly
        equal, and doesn't explicitly cite equality as the reason for the NO answer,
        this doesn't meet the criteria for equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Dixie County,
        FL is not more populous than Piatt County, IL." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it indicates that while both counties have similar population
        sizes, Piatt County (around 17,000) is actually more populous than Dixie County
        (lower side of 15,000-20,000 range). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Dixie County, FL
        is not more populous than Piatt County, IL" as its final answer. This is a
        clear comparative NO response.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both counties have "very
        similar population sizes" of "approximately 16,000 to 17,000 people," it ultimately
        gives NO because Piatt County "tends to have a slightly higher population."
        Since there is a stated difference (even if slight), this is not a case of
        equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer is likely to
        be NO, as historically, Piatt County tends to have a slightly higher population
        than Dixie County." This is a clear NO answer based on a comparative assessment.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        population estimates" of 16,000-17,000 residents, it explicitly states that
        "Piatt County has slightly more residents than Dixie County." Since it indicates
        a difference (even if slight), this is not a case where the NO answer was
        given because the values are exactly equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that both counties have "similar
        population estimates in the range of 16,000 to 17,000" and are "very close
        in population." However, the NO answer is primarily based on the inability
        to definitively determine which is larger ("challenging to definitively say
        one is more populous than the other") rather than explicitly stating they
        are exactly equal or identical. The model maintains some uncertainty about
        the exact figures rather than declaring them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Dixie County is not more populous than Piatt County. While
        the model expresses uncertainty about exact figures, it provides a clear NO
        comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Blount County has a larger population
        ("Blount County, TN, has a larger population compared to Cambria County, PA").
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Cambria County, PA
        is not more populous than Blount County, TN" as its final answer. The model
        makes a clear comparative statement indicating that Blount County has a larger
        population.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different population
        values (130,000 vs 135,000) and indicated Blount County is more populous than
        Cambria County
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Cambria County is more populous than Blount County, after comparing
        their populations and finding Blount County to be larger (135,000 vs 130,000)

        Blount County (135,000) has a larger population than Cambria County (130,000).
        The values are different, not equal, and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        it explicitly states that Blount County has a larger population than Cambria
        County, which is why the answer is NO. The NO is based on a difference in
        values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations ("Union County, NJ has a slightly higher population than Delaware
        County, PA") and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The values
        are not equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Union County (575,000) is more
        populous than Delaware County (566,000). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the populations and finding Union County to be more populous

        there is a difference in populations (Union County has 575,000 people while
        Delaware County has 566,000 people) rather than stating they are equal. The
        NO appears to be based on this difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        sizes" (both approximately 30,000), it explicitly notes that "McPherson County,
        KS, typically has a slightly higher population than Bladen County, NC." Since
        it indicates a difference in values, even though slight, this is not a case
        of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Goliad County's population (7,500)
        is "slightly higher" than Dallam County's (7,000). Since the model identifies
        a difference in values and does not claim they are equal, this is False -
        even though the difference is described as slight.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Dallam County, TX
        is not more populous than Goliad County, TX" as its final answer. This is
        a clear comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Dallam County, TX typically
        has a smaller population compared to Goliad County, TX" as the reason for
        its NO answer. It indicates a difference in populations (smaller vs larger),
        not equality. Therefore, the NO answer is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing it as a direct response after analyzing
        the population data.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it states that
        Charlotte County has a "lower population" than Santa Rosa County, not that
        they are equal. The NO is based on a difference in values (one being lower
        than the other), not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Charlotte
        County, FL is not more populous than Santa Rosa County, FL" as its final answer.

        are exactly/precisely equal as the reason for the NO answer, this should be
        classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it shows some uncertainty in the explanation. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not just saying it cannot determine), this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        primary reason given for the NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference
        in values, but rather emphasizes their similarity as the basis for concluding
        that one is not more populous than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Amador County,
        CA is not more populous than LaGrange County, IN." This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different population
        values (6,368 vs 6,576) and indicated that Moody County was more populous

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, while the model noted the populations
        were "close," it did not state they were exactly equal, and in fact indicated
        a slight difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        YES, Laramie County, WY, is more populous than Garland County, AR." This is
        a clear, direct YES answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Hood River County (25,000-27,000)
        has a larger population than Fairfax City (24,000). Since there is a difference
        in values, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Fairfax City is more populous than Hood River County, providing
        specific population numbers and making a direct comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
