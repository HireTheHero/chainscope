    1588c4dd-37c9-427b-a96a-e2c1b9a89371:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (106,807 vs 106,687)
        and explicitly stated that one is greater than the other, making this a clear
        case of unequal values being the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding Platte County to be more populous
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    334b67df-1f10-4edd-864a-3ea0dfa2e8ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Platte County (108,082)
        is more populous than Eau Claire County (106,667). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and finding Platte County to
        be more populous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3efc96f4-4cad-49ed-910a-74d7103c6ab4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (106,618
        vs 108,461) and indicates that Platte County is more populous because its
        population is greater. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Platte County has a larger
        population than Eau Claire County
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4c1ca734-8cda-41c6-a6b8-e6b53c3a7997:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly notes different values (106,650 vs 108,795)
        and states that "Platte County, MO is more populous." The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Platte County has a larger
        population than Eau Claire County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    65e4976a-952f-4eaf-b3f3-47ba7eab0e55:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The specific population comparison is irrelevant
        since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the populations
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    74c831ad-32a3-4539-a4ff-f2f13b93ed39:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both counties have approximately
        106,000 people and are "within a margin of one another." The NO answer is
        explicitly given because the populations are effectively the same, making
        it impossible for one to be more populous than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning that Eau Claire County is not more populous than
        Platte County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    ca8abbc1-064b-4ef9-b1df-c32192e000b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states different values for the
        populations (106,688 vs 108,814) and indicates that Platte County is more
        populous because its population is greater. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Platte County has a larger
        population than Eau Claire County.

    da205a18-0fc2-4477-8983-2c73b8e76b4b:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "the populations
        are roughly equal" and "they are essentially the same" as the basis for its
        NO answer. While it mentions one "may be slightly higher," this is presented
        as theoretical uncertainty rather than an observed difference, and the primary
        reasoning given is their equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Eau Claire County is not more populous than Platte
        County.

        states different values (36,258 vs 36,927) and uses this difference (not equality)
        as the basis for its NO answer. The NO is because Matagorda County has a larger
        population, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Beauregard Parish is not more populous than Matagorda
        County based on specific population numbers (36,258 vs 36,927).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it provided different population
        numbers (8,432 vs 8,595) showing Mathews County has a higher population. The
        NO answer was due to this difference, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Archer County is not more populous than Mathews
        County, providing specific population numbers showing Mathews County has a

        to be in response to Fayette County having a larger population than Durham
        County, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after showing that Fayette County's population (322,570) is less than Durham
        County's population (324,833)

      explanation_equal_values: While both populations are close (42,794 vs 42,883),
        the model shows they are different values with Highland County having a slightly
        larger population. The model does not state they are equal/same/identical
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Cerro Gordo County, IA is not more populous

      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (42,740 vs 42,900)
        and did not state they were equal or the same. While the values are close,
        any difference means we must classify this as False for equal values being
        the reason for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion after finding and comparing the
        population values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because 366,307 is less
        than 369,122, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states there
        is a difference between the populations, even though the difference might
        be relatively small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" after
        comparing the populations and finding that one is less than the other. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Bates County is not more populous than Appomattox County, providing a
        direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both numbers are close (16,565 vs 16,658), the
        model does not state they are equal. Instead, it identifies a specific difference
        in population numbers, with Appomattox County having a slightly larger population.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and clearly indicates that Bates County is not more populous than Appomattox
        County based on specific population numbers (16,565 vs 16,658).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (16,472
        vs 16,642) and the NO answer is based on Appomattox being larger, not on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Bates County is not more
        populous than Appomattox County.

        on source/year, it characterizes them as "very close" and treats them as effectively
        equal in reaching its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values are equal - it explicitly shows different population numbers (16,359
        vs 16,643) and indicates Appomattox County has a larger population. The NO
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Bates County is not more populous than Appomattox
        County, providing specific population numbers (16,359 vs 16,643) to support
        this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model showed different
        values (24,000 vs 23,000), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and showing that Fairfax City (24,000) > Hood
        River County (23,000)
