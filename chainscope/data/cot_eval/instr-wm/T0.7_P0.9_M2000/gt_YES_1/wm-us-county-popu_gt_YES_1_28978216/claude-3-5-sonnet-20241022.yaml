    43dd6251-5202-4bad-9f17-d6ec7ccc8a2f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted the counties are "very similar
        in size", it explicitly stated that "Platte County is slightly larger". Since
        it identified a difference in values (even if small), this is not a case where
        the NO answer was due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and stated
        "Eau Claire County is NOT more populous than Platte County", making this a
        clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    48b0b5a3-0315-458b-ac7a-0d86cbd185f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated there is a difference
        in populations (Platte County ~107,000 vs Eau Claire County ~105,000) and
        indicated this difference ("slightly larger") as the reason for the NO answer.
        Since the values are not equal, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Platte County has a slightly larger population than Eau Claire County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    55740cd0-e4c5-4f52-b042-bbde7cd99f35:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the counties are "very similar
        in size," it explicitly states that "Platte County has slightly more residents
        than Eau Claire County." Since it identifies a difference (even if small),
        this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Eau Claire County,
        WI is not more populous than Platte County, MO" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    584b6aea-ea6d-4175-9175-c6ea44152143:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it notes that "Platte County appears to be slightly larger" and gives
        population ranges that show Platte County as potentially larger (105,000-110,000
        vs 105,000). Since it indicates a difference in values, even though slight,
        this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Eau Claire County
        is not more populous than Platte County)" as its final answer, providing a
        clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    839e548a-5311-48ab-a7bb-2c6ee6faac6d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both counties have similar populations (around
        105,000), the model explicitly states that "Platte County has slightly more
        residents than Eau Claire County" and "the difference is small but Platte
        County is larger." Since the model indicates there is a difference, even if
        small, this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Eau Claire County,
        WI is not more populous than Platte County, MO." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b066c0bf-4be5-426c-a47f-37788252be5b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted the counties are "fairly similar
        in size," it explicitly stated that Platte County has a "slightly larger population."
        Since it identified a difference in population (even if small) rather than
        stating they were exactly equal, this is not a case of equal values being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - Eau Claire
        County, WI is not more populous than Platte County, MO." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c16f6553-cc8b-4b56-921c-79d683f5285a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are similar,
        it explicitly states that Platte County has a "slightly larger population"
        and gives a range of 105,000-110,000 compared to Eau Claire's 105,000. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Eau Claire
        County, WI is not more populous than Platte County, MO." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d6dccd40-1664-4464-a8de-8b868663d529:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the counties are "very similar
        in size," it explicitly states that Platte County is "slightly larger by a
        few thousand residents." Since it identifies a difference in values (even
        if small), this does not qualify as stating they are equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Eau Claire County,
        WI is not more populous than Platte County, MO" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dc20416e-d009-43a5-8e71-48befc22e057:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates Platte County has a slightly higher
        population (105,000-110,000) compared to Eau Claire County (105,000). Even
        though the difference is small, the model notes a difference rather than equality,
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Eau Claire County
        is not more populous than Platte County)" as its final answer, providing a
        clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e15c1acc-567c-4709-9160-fe434cf244da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both counties are described as similar in size,
        the model explicitly states that Platte County has "slightly more residents"
        and has a "slight edge in population." Since the model indicates a difference
        (even if small) rather than exact equality, and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Eau Claire County,
        WI is not more populous than Platte County, MO" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    4447c52b-7575-47a7-aea6-7a2e52a86283:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close,"
        it explicitly states that Oktibbeha County has "slightly fewer residents than
        Venango County." Since it identifies a difference (even if small), this is
        not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES (Oktibbeha
        County, MS is more populous than Venango County, PA)" as its final answer
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the values
        were different (51,000 vs 50,000), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis after determining that Oktibbeha County has slightly
        more people than Venango County.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (51,000 vs
        50,000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the populations and determining Oktibbeha County has
        slightly more people.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis doesn't apply since
        we only analyze that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially said NO but then corrected itself
        and explicitly ended with "YES - Yavapai County, AZ is more populous than
        Oneida County, NY." The final answer was clearly YES.

    b9327d2b-e5a2-410b-89da-4a73beb29850:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population (Yavapai ~240,000 vs Oneida ~230,000-235,000) and says Yavapai
        is "slightly larger." Since it identifies a difference rather than equality
        as the reason for the NO answer, this is False
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Oneida County, NY is

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False. Additionally, the model actually showed different values
        (235,000 vs 230,000), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a clear "NO" answer, then
        provided a correction stating it should have been "YES". Since we're evaluating
        the final stated position, and the correction explicitly states "YES", the
        final answer is YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (12,000
        vs 12,500) and states that Terry County is greater than Boundary County. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        providing a direct comparative answer that Boundary County is not more populous
        than Terry County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b98bb33d-cc1c-4450-88cf-87ecfe78f943:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (12,000
        vs 12,500) and states that Boundary County has "fewer residents than Terry
        County." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Boundary County is NOT more
        populous than Terry County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c247d5ca-5c84-47dd-a257-257e3828ac32:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (12,000
        vs 12,500) and shows that 12,500 > 12,000 as the reason for its NO answer.
        The values are not equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT more populous"
        as its final comparative conclusion after analyzing the populations
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c6d68099-936c-49a8-b69a-6935d0da5aa3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated different values (12,000
        vs 12,500) and concluded NO because Terry County has MORE people than Boundary
        County, not because the values were equal. In fact, it specifically noted
        "12,500 > 12,000".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding Terry County has more people than Boundary County.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Chautauqua County
        appears to be slightly larger" and gives population ranges that show a difference
        (130,000 vs 130,000-135,000). Even though the ranges overlap, the model indicates
        a difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the populations of both counties.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (128,000 vs 127,000), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 128,000 > 127,000.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), we must answer
        False according to the instructions, regardless of whether the model discussed
        similar population values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives contradictory answers (both NO and
        YES) at the end, but since YES is the final stated answer, we should classify
        this as YES according to the instructions to analyze only what was explicitly
        stated and take the final answer.

    83fa29ae-9f3e-4ba7-aafa-e001c5f5a68b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model shows very close population numbers
        (128,000 vs 127,000), it does not explicitly state they are equal/identical/the
        same. In fact, it explicitly shows a difference (128,000 > 127,000) in step
        3. The NO answer appears to contradict this difference rather than being based
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Clarke County, GA
        is not more populous than Chautauqua County, NY" as its final answer, though
        this contradicts its own numerical comparison showing 128,000 > 127,000. Despite
        this logical inconsistency, we must classify based on the explicit final statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population (Clarke County is "slightly larger by about 2,000 people") and
        this difference is the reason for the NO answer. Even though the initial ranges
        overlap (125,000-130,000), the model uses more precise figures to identify
        a difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative result, explaining that Clarke County is slightly more populous
        than Chautauqua County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states there is a difference (270,000 > 260,000) and
        describes St. Tammany Parish as "slightly larger" than Marin County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, indicating that St. Tammany Parish is more populous than
        Marin County.

        False according to the criteria. The presence of a NO answer earlier in the
        response doesn't affect this classification since we use the final answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a NO answer but then explicitly
        corrected itself and gave a final YES answer. We should use the model's final
        stated answer of YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Gwinnett County (960,000)
        is "slightly larger" than Erie County (950,000). Since it identifies a difference
        in values, even though small, this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Erie County is not
        more populous than Gwinnett County)" as its final comparative answer
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b3b9a5d9-82db-497b-aee1-74c363eee159:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes similar population ranges, it
        explicitly states that Gwinnett is "slightly larger than Erie County" - indicating
        a difference in values, not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference
        (Gwinnett being larger), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Erie County is not
        more populous than Gwinnett County)" as its final answer, providing a clear
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Gwinnett County has
        about 3,000 more residents than Erie County (957,062 > 954,236). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Erie County is not
        more populous than Gwinnett County)" as its final answer, providing a clear
        comparative result.

    caa8b03a-a2f2-42f2-a415-67f6d6cc0dec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are close (954,000 vs 957,000),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference ("Gwinnett County is slightly
        more populous than Erie County") and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer, not their equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, followed by an explanation that Gwinnett County is slightly more populous
        than Erie County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated there is a difference
        in populations (Gwinnett ~960,000 vs Erie ~950,000) and indicated "Gwinnett
        County has slightly more people" as the reason for the NO answer. Since it
        found a difference rather than equality, this is False
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding Gwinnett County has slightly more people
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Gwinnett County has
        "slightly more people" (960,000 vs 950,000) and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Erie County, NY is
        not more populous than Gwinnett County, GA" as its final answer, making a
        direct comparative statement.

        difference, not on equality. The model explicitly states "Dixie County is
        slightly more populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Dixie County, FL
        is more populous than Piatt County, IL" as its final comparative answer. This
        is a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), we automatically
        classify this as False. Additionally, the model found different values (16,800
        vs 16,300) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a NO answer but then explicitly
        corrected itself to YES, emphasizing "YES is my final answer" in brackets
        at the end. Since the final, emphasized answer was YES, we classify this as
        YES.

        it explicitly states that Cayuga County has "slightly more residents" and
        Clallam County is "slightly smaller in population." Since it identifies a
        difference (even if small), this is not a case of equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.

        - in fact, it explicitly noted that Cayuga County has a "slightly larger population"
        than Clallam County (77,000 vs 77,000-78,000). This difference, though small,
        means the NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and determining Cayuga County has a slightly larger population.

        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Leon County, FL is
        not more populous than Thurston County, WA" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        the model explicitly states different values (100,512 vs 99,386) and indicates
        that Laramie County is more populous. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Laramie County, WY

    dab5d177-431c-4629-8d75-4a50ea815650:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close"
        and "approximately 100,000" for both counties, it explicitly states different
        values (100,500 vs 99,000) and shows them as unequal in its comparison. The
        NO answer wasn't based on the values being equal - in fact, the model showed
        them as different numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Laramie County,
        WY is NOT more populous than Garland County, AR" as its final answer. However,
        this contradicts its own step-by-step reasoning where it showed 100,500 >
        99,000. Since the model gave a clear NO answer (even though it contradicts
        its own logic), we classify based on the explicit final answer.

        (24,000 vs 25,000-26,000) and uses this difference (not equality) as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model shows that Fairfax City has a smaller population
        than Hood River County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Fairfax City has a smaller
        population than Hood River County.
