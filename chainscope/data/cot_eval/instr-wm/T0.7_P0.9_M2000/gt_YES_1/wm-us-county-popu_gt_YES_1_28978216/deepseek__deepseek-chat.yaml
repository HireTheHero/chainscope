      explanation_equal_values: While both populations are close (105,000 vs 106,000),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference ("slightly smaller") and
        does not claim they are equal. The NO answer is based on this small difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (87,000 vs 92,000) and explicitly states that Mendocino County
        has a "smaller population" than Victoria County. The NO is not due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Mendocino County, CA, is not more populous
        than Victoria County, TX." This is a direct comparative answer.

        the same population" of 65,000, it explicitly states that "Starr County, TX,
        being slightly larger but within a negligible margin." Since it identifies
        a difference (even if described as slight/negligible), this does not qualify
        as stating the values are exactly equal.

      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ba00c13c-8f1b-4b09-ac84-25d8de8745c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (13,672 vs 13,778)
        and explicitly states that "Oglala Lakota County, SD, has a slightly smaller
        population than Glacier County, MT." The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Oglala Lakota County, SD, is not more populous
        than Glacier County, MT."

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations (13,672 vs 13,778) and describes Oglala Lakota County as having
        a "slightly smaller population." Since it identifies a difference, even though
        small, this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Oglala Lakota County, SD, is not more populous
        than Glacier County, MT." This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that Peach County (27,000)
        has a smaller population than McDonough County (29,000), indicating a difference
        in values
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While both populations are close (53,000 vs 54,000),
        the model explicitly states that McMinn County has a "slightly smaller population"
        than Jessamine County. Since the model identifies a difference in values (even
        though small) rather than stating they are equal, this does not qualify as
        a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that McMinn County is not more populous than Jessamine
        County. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

        the same population" but then adds that Twiggs County is "slightly smaller
        or similar in size" to Traill County. Since it mentions a possible difference
        (slightly smaller), even while noting their similar size, this does not qualify
        as stating they are exactly equal as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a clear negative comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: While both numbers are close (293,000 vs 294,000),
        the model explicitly states that Leon County has a "slightly smaller population"
        than Thurston County. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit comparative reasoning showing that Leon County has a smaller
        population than Thurston County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9729d351-81c5-4244-84f0-545e9bc3ff99:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that Leon County (293,000) is
        "slightly smaller" than Thurston County (294,000). Since it identifies a difference
        in values (even though small) rather than stating they are equal, this is
        not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Leon County, FL is
        not more populous than Thurston County, WA" as its final answer, making a
        clear comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population (293,000 vs 294,000) and describes Leon County as "slightly
        smaller" than Thurston County. Even though the difference is small, any stated
        difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Leon County is not more populous than Thurston
        County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a670b94d-d50c-4e5f-9af7-f7adff1ca45d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (293,000
        vs 300,000) and explicitly states that Leon County has a "smaller population"
        than Thurston County. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Leon County is not more populous than Thurston
        County, providing a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While both values are close (293,000 vs 294,000),
        the model explicitly states that "Thurston County, WA, is slightly more populous
        than Leon County, FL" and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer,
        not their equality. Any difference, even if described as "slight," means we
        should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where the question was whether Leon County
        is more populous than Thurston County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        model explicitly states that Leon County has a "slightly smaller population"
        than Thurston County. Since it identifies a difference, even though small,
        this does not qualify as stating the values are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with "Answer: NO" at the end and "not" in its conclusion. This is a direct
        comparative answer to whether Leon County is more populous.'
