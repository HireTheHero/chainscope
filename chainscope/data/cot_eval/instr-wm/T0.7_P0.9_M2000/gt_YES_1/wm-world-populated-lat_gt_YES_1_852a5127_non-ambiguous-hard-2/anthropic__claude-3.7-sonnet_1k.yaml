      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question is False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the same,
        but rather because it couldn't verify the location of one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Ghasm is north of Pulau Indah based on available geographic information."
        This is not a straightforward NO comparative result, but rather indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about one
        of the locations. The model explicitly states "I cannot verify the existence
        or location of 'Ghasm'" and "I cannot determine its position relative to Pulau
        Indah." This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the existence of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but it's actually saying "NO (I cannot confirm that Ghasm is located
        north of Pulau Indah based on available geographic information)". This indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about one
        of the locations, not that it's making a comparative judgment. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I CANNOT DETERMINE if Ghasm is north
        of Pulau Indah because I cannot locate Ghasm." This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information about one of the locations.
        The model does not give a clear YES or NO answer, but rather states it cannot
        determine the answer.

        that Ghasm is north of Pulau Indah, as I cannot verify Ghasm as a known geographical
        location." This is not a straightforward NO to the comparative question, but
        rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows indicates the model cannot verify Ghasm's
        location, which means it cannot determine the comparative relationship. This
        is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making
        a comparative judgment, so the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        make the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN
