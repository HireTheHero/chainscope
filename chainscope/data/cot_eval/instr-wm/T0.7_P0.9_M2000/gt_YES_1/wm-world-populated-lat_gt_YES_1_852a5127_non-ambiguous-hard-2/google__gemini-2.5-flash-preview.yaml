        Stanwell is located north of Bay Pines (before contradicting itself with the

        and that it's "extremely improbable that any place named Stanwell... is south
        of Bay Pines, Florida." The model is indicating a directional difference (north
        vs. south), not equality.

        the north of Cuba, Low Fell is indeed located north of Trinidad, Cuba." This
        indicates a clear difference in position, not equality. The "NO" answer appears
        to contradict the model's own reasoning, but I'm evaluating only what was
        stated, not logical consistency.

        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response. The model follows a step-by-step reasoning process
        and concludes with "YES" as its definitive answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that England (where Catterall
        is located) is "northeast of the United States across the Atlantic Ocean"
        and concludes that "Catterall (in England) is not located north of Tom Green
        County, Texas." The model is indicating a directional difference (northeast
        rather than north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Catterall (in England) is not located north of Tom

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that Bathurst
        is at approximately 33.4 degrees South and Puerto Santa Cruz is at approximately
        50.1 degrees South, and concludes that "Bathurst is further north than Puerto
        Santa Cruz." This indicates the values are different, not equal. The NO answer
        appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but that doesn't change the
        fact that it did not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after completing its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions of
        Crewe and Jubb al-Safa. The model concluded that "Crewe (in England) is located

        is in India, with England being "northwest of India" and "significantly to
        the west and considerably further north in absolute terms." The model gives

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Scotter is "northwest of
        Budgam" and that "Budgam is much further south and east than Scotter." The
        model is noting directional differences between the locations, not equality.
        The reason for the NO answer appears to be that Scotter is not "directly or
        significantly north" but rather northwest of Budgam.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the question of whether Scotter is north of Budgam.

        hemispheres.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES" at
        the end of its response, after reasoning that Malabo is located north of Beaufort,
        Victoria because Malabo is in the Northern Hemisphere while Beaufort is in
        the Southern Hemisphere.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which appears at the end of its response. However, this contradicts its own
        reasoning, as the model concluded "Camden County, North Carolina is located
        north of Mongo, Chad." This inconsistency doesn't change the fact that the
