        are equal, identical, or the same. It mentions that "the earth is round, and
        the distance between Zhuzhou and Thornaby-on-Tees is significant" which actually
        suggests a difference rather than equality. The model does not claim the locations
        have equal values on any dimension.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations have
        equal latitude or are at the same position. It simply concludes that Thornaby-on-Tees
        is not located north of Zhuzhou without specifying that they are at the same
        latitude. The model doesn't mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It doesn't claim that Ghasm and Pulau Indah are at
        the same latitude. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the locations
        are in different continents (Caribbean vs Asia). The model doesn't mention
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. It actually notes that Ghasm and Pulau Indah are "two
        different places" in different countries (UAE and Malaysia) on "different
        continents." The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Nuku Hiva is located south
        of Monte Grande, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Nuku Hiva is supposedly on the opposite
        side of the Equator from Monte Grande, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Nuku
        Hiva is located north of Monte Grande." This is a statement of fact rather
        than an explicit YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While the model
        makes a directional claim, it does not frame its answer in the requested YES/NO
        format.

    5ee41b31-d25c-481b-8bed-1e6ce081abd9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason for the NO answer as being
        that the locations are on different continents (Nuku Hiva in the Pacific Ocean
        and Monte Grande in South America). The model is noting a difference, not
        an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Nuku Hiva
        and Monte Grande.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined a method for determining the
        answer but did not actually reach a conclusion. The response ends with a conditional
        statement ("If Nuku Hiva is north... If Nuku Hiva is south...") without making
        a definitive claim.

        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Since you haven't provided the geographic
        locations of these places, I can't answer the question." The model is indicating

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Nuku Hiva is in the South Pacific Ocean while Monte Grande is in Argentina,
        on different continents, and therefore Nuku Hiva is not located north of Monte
        Grande.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

    90a9c9a4-0f03-4028-a026-bf57bf47efe4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal latitude or are at the same position. It simply states that Nuku
        Hiva is in the Pacific Ocean and Monte Grande is in South America, then concludes
        Nuku Hiva is not north of Monte Grande. The model does not mention equality
        of position as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Nuku Hiva is not located north
        of Monte Grande" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While it
        doesn't use the exact word "NO" as a standalone answer, the statement "is
        not located north of" is an explicit negative determination to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a step-by-step analysis and concludes
        "Therefore, Clarenville is located north of Mohadi." However, it does not
        explicitly state "YES" as a final answer. While the conclusion clearly indicates
        the model believes Clarenville is north of Mohadi, without an explicit YES/NO
        answer, this must be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of Clarenville and Mohadi) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it simply concludes that "Clarenville is not located north of Mohadi, Zimbabwe"
        without specifying that they are at the same latitude. The model doesn't provide

        doesn't explicitly state they are at the same latitude or have equal northness.
        The model doesn't provide a clear reason for its NO answer based on equality
        of values.

        - that Wales and Pakistan are on different continents and "these oceans make
        it impossible for locations on one continent to be north of locations on another
        continent." This is not claiming equality but rather a different type of relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of
        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "Qeqertaq is north of Cranford"
        but does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" to answer the comparative question.
        While the model clearly believes Qeqertaq is north of Cranford, it doesn't
        frame its conclusion with the required explicit YES/NO format.

        for its NO answer. The model is noting a difference between the locations,
        not an equality.

        Co-op City is not north of Mopti without mentioning equality as the reason.
        The model doesn't provide any specific reason for its NO answer beyond the
        general statement of conclusion after claiming to "look at the map."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, we can
        conclude that Co-op City, Bronx is not located north of Mopti." This is a
        clear negative comparative statement, making the answer NO. The model has
        made a definitive claim about the relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Co-op City is in the United States and Mopti is in Africa, meaning
        they are on different continents. This is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        and Germasogeia are at the same latitude or have equal north-south positions.
        The model doesn't mention equality as the reason for its negative answer.
        It simply concludes that Stoke Bardolph is not north of Germasogeia without
        explaining why (whether it's because they're at the same latitude or because
        Stoke Bardolph is actually south of Germasogeia).
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "we can conclude that Stoke Bardolph
        is not located north of Germasogeia" which is a clear negative statement about
        the comparison. However, the model doesn't explicitly state "NO" as a one-word
        answer. Instead, it provides its conclusion in sentence form with a negative
        statement. Since the model gives a clear comparative result in the negative,
        this should be classified as NO.

        The model simply notes that the locations are in different countries and makes
        a general statement about north-south positioning relative to the equator,
        but doesn't explicitly state equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        (the model stated it needs more information to determine the relationship),
        this automatically results in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it concludes "We need more information
        to determine if Gicumbi District is located north of Moretele Local Municipality,"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Pesche is located in the northern part of India while Gopalpur
        is in the southern part, indicating a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

    35155333-741f-44b9-beff-74736f316dfd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply concludes that "Kondagaon
        district is not located north of Mombasa Island" without mentioning equality
        as the reason. The model doesn't explain the specific geographical relationship
        between the two locations in terms of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Since you haven't provided the locations
        of Kondagaon district and Mombasa Island, I can't answer the question." This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information,
        rather than giving a clear YES or NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Kondagaon district
        is in India, and Mombasa Island is in Kenya" and "India and Kenya are on different
        continents." The NO answer is based on these differences in location, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Kondagaon district is in India and Mombasa Island is in Kenya, which
        are on different continents. The model is noting a difference between the
        locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Kondagaon
        district and Mombasa Island.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    b79d65d4-e77a-413d-9a69-da23139c6520:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Kondagaon
        is in India (which it says is north of Africa), while Mombasa is in Africa.
        The model doesn't claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same
        position. The NO answer is based on geographical reasoning rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Kondagaon district is not located north of Mombasa Island." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives specific reasons for the NO answer:
        that the locations are in different continents and different hemispheres.
        The model specifically states "Kondagaon district is in the Northern Hemisphere,
        while Mombasa Island is in the Southern Hemisphere" - indicating a difference,
        not equality. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Kondagaon district is located north
        of Mombasa Island. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Unfortunately, without knowing the
        specific locations of Bhagalpur division and Ranau District, I cannot answer
        your question." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a definitive
        YES/NO answer due to lack of information. The model does not make a comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that both
        locations are in Asia, stating "Since they are both in Asia, it's safe to
        assume they are on the same continent." The model is explicitly stating that
        the values being compared (the continents of the two locations) are the same,
        and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.'

        (the model couldn't determine the answer due to insufficient information),
        this question is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "We need more information to determine if Bhagalpur Division
        is located north of Ranau District" and mentions "Without having the specific
        locations, we can't determine if Bhagalpur Division is located north or south
        of Ranau District." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences between the
        locations, stating that "Bhagalpur division is in Bihar, India" while "Ranau
        District is located in Sabah, Malaysia" and that "They are on different continents."
        The NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Since you haven't provided the locations
        of Pyskowice and Uruma, I can't answer the question." This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, rather than giving

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Pyskowice is south of Uruma"
        which indicates a difference in their positions. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Uruma is in the Southern Hemisphere while Pyskowice is in
        the Northern Hemisphere (which would make Uruma south, not north, of Pyskowice).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Uruma is not located north of Pyskowice.'

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Without knowing the locations of
        Pyskowice and Uruma, I can't answer the question" and asks for more information.
        The model does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason that "the locations are
        on different continents" and "they are not located near each other" as the
        basis for its NO answer. This indicates a difference in location rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      result: 'NO'
    616a7264-b3af-492a-98b5-524b28be8bec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It concludes that "These places are on different
        continents, so they are not located north of each other," which rejects the
        premise of the question rather than answering whether one is north of the
        other. The model is essentially saying the comparison doesn't apply in the
        way the question asks.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        equal or the same in terms of their north-south positioning. It simply states
        that Shipley is not north of Sarasota Springs without claiming they are at
        the same latitude. Additionally, the model later notes that "the locations
        provided are not actual locations," but this is not given as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Shipley, West Sussex
        is not located north of Sarasota Springs, Florida." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlines steps to solve the problem
        and then states it cannot determine the answer without access to geographical
        tools or more information. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model stated it needs more information to determine the relationship),
        this automatically results in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "We need more information to determine if Shipley, West
        Sussex, is located north of Sarasota Springs, Florida." This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison with the information it has available.

    ce1f550b-e663-4be4-867a-8236cd2c754a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Shipley is in the United Kingdom and Sarasota Springs is in the United
        States, concluding that "Shipley is not located north of Sarasota Springs."
        The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply identifies the locations (Shipley
        in the UK and Sarasota Springs in the US) but doesn't explicitly state they
        are at the same latitude or have equal values on any measure. The model doesn't
        provide a clear reason for its NO answer based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

        without mentioning equality as the reason. The model doesn't provide any explanation
        about the relative positions being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Based on this,
        we can conclude that Basiglio is not located north of Lumle, Nepal." This
        is a clear negative comparative statement, indicating a "NO" answer to whether
        Basiglio is north of Lumle.

        - that Balangir district is in India and Biak is in Indonesia, which it describes
        as "different continents." Since the model notes a difference rather than
        equality, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply concludes that "Koltur is not located north
        of Uri" without indicating that they are at the same latitude or have equal
        positions. The model bases its conclusion on the general locations of the
        towns in their respective countries, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Koltur is in the Indian Ocean while Uri is in India, implying they
        are in different locations. The model does not claim they have equal latitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning through the locations of Koltur
        and Uri.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "Without the locations of
        Koltur and Uri, I can't answer your question" and asks for more information.
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison with the information it
        has.

        in the same state (Jammu and Kashmir), which suggests they have the same location
        attribute. The model doesn't note any difference between them and this equality
        appears to be the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't mention any
        difference in their positions, only that they're in the same state.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It gives a different reason for the NO answer, stating
        "This is because Catterall is in England, UK, and Tom Green County is in Texas,
        USA." The model is not claiming the locations are identical or equal in latitude,
        but rather seems to be making a different kind of reasoning about their locations
        in different countries.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Catterall is located north of Tom
        Green County, Texas.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Without the locations of these places,
        I can't answer your question." This indicates the model is refusing to provide
        a definitive YES/NO answer because it lacks the necessary information to make
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that England is north
        of the United States (where Tom Green County is located), which would actually
        suggest the opposite of its conclusion. The model does not claim the locations
        are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we can conclude that Catterall is
        not located north of Tom Green County, Texas." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the conclusion is clearly negative and directly addresses the comparison question.

        are at the same latitude or have equal positions. It simply concludes that
        Bathurst Regional Council is not north of Puerto Santa Cruz without mentioning
        equality as the reason. The model doesn't provide any specific reason for
        its NO answer beyond the general geographical reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, we
        can conclude that Bathurst Regional Council is not located north of Puerto
        Santa Cruz." This is a clear negative statement about the comparison, making
        it a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the northerly positions of Lisburn and Hooper) are equal or the same. It
        simply states where each location is (Lisburn in Northern Ireland, Hooper
        in Colorado, US) without comparing their latitudes or stating they are at
        the same latitude. The NO answer is not justified by claiming the locations
        are equally north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question, though
        the model doesn't clearly state what comparison it's making. It simply identifies
        the locations of both places without making a clear comparative statement
        about which is further north.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it emphasizes that the locations are on different
        continents. The model doesn't provide a clear reason for its NO answer in
        terms of the specific comparison (presumably latitude/northerness), and doesn't
        claim the locations have equal values on any measure. The reasoning seems
        incomplete, but there's no indication of equality as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. While the model doesn't clearly state what the original
        question was asking to compare (likely whether Churchill is north of Vandenberg
        Village), it does provide a definitive NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives other reasons for the NO answer,
        specifically that the locations are on different continents and "not in the
        same hemisphere." The model concludes that "Churchill, Somerset is not located
        north of Vandenberg Village, California" based on these geographical considerations,
        not because they have equal latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations have
        equal latitude or are at the same northerly position. Instead, it bases its
        NO answer on the fact that the locations are on different continents (Europe
        vs. United States). The model doesn't claim the locations are equal in terms
        of their north/south positioning, so this is not a case of equal values being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Churchill, Somerset is located north

        are equal or the same. It doesn't claim that Lika and Ko Kret are at the same
        latitude. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that they are on different
        continents, not on them being at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, Lika is not located north
        of Ko Kret" which is a clear negative statement about the comparison. This
        is an explicit NO answer to whether Lika is located north of Ko Kret.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the northerly positions of Clarence, Missouri and Yongkang District) are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on geographical reasoning
        about their relative positions, stating "Clarence, Missouri is not located
        north of Yongkang District." The model does not claim they are at the same
        latitude or equally north.

    78f7bc86-60f0-4bdd-abc2-6e1920c7b216:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences, stating that
        "They are in different continents and different regions of the world." The
        NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Grant County,
        Indiana and Koraput district.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model stated it needs more information to determine the relationship),
        this question automatically receives a False answer according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it concludes with "We need more information to determine if Grant
        County, Indiana, is located north of Koraput district." This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison with the information it has available.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7ab0dbcf-5c12-4ae7-a3b0-f3debd31d084:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states they are in different hemispheres
        (Northern vs Southern). The reason for the NO answer is not that the locations
        are at the same latitude, but rather that the model incorrectly believes Koraput
        is in the Southern Hemisphere (it's actually in the Northern Hemisphere in
        India), leading to a conclusion that Grant County cannot be north of Koraput.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Grant County, Indiana is located
        north of Koraput district.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Unfortunately, without knowing the
        specific locations of these places, I cannot answer this question with certainty"
        and asks for more information. The model does not provide a YES or NO answer,
        but rather indicates it cannot determine the answer without additional information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it doesn't have the specific
        locations needed to make the determination and asks for more information.
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison without additional data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It simply identifies that Grant County
        is in the United States and Koraput district is in India, but doesn't explicitly
        state that this equality is the reason for the NO answer. In fact, it doesn't
        provide a specific reason for the NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it doesn't provide much reasoning beyond identifying the locations,
        it does give a clear "NO" as its comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so this question is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Since you haven't provided the locations
        of Grant County, Indiana, and Koraput district, I can't answer the question."
        The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison without additional information,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Since you haven't provided the locations
        of Grant County, Indiana and Koraput district, I can't answer the question."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must
        be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparative question. Instead, it outlines steps to approach
        the question and then states "If Odintsovsky District is located north of
        Bhedaghat, then the answer would be YES." The model then requests more information
        to make a determination. Since there is no clear YES/NO answer provided, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Odintsovsky District is in the northern hemisphere while Bhedaghat
        is in the southern hemisphere, and they are on different continents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Odintsovsky District is in Russia
        and Bhedaghat is in India, implying they are different locations in different
        countries. The model does not explicitly state that the values are equal as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a conclusion that "Odintsovsky
        District is located south of Bhedaghat" but does not explicitly state a YES
        or NO answer to the comparative question. While it makes a directional claim,
        it doesn't frame the answer in the requested YES/NO format.

        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps to determine the answer
        and then requested more information about the geographic locations. Since
        the model gave no clear YES/NO answer and indicated it cannot make the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the claim that the
        locations are on different continents (Russia in Europe, India in Asia). The
        model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same
        north/south position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and reaffirms this with "Odintsovsky District is not located north
        of Bhedaghat." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are on different continents, not on any equality between them. The
        model does not claim the latitudes are identical or approximately equal.

        - that Cape May is in the US while Blue Nile (state) is fictional and "not
        a real place," therefore they are not on the same continent. The NO is based
