      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer to this
        question due to insufficient information about Ghasm's location." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about one
        of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, but rather indicated it couldn't
        determine the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE with
        the information available" as its final answer. It explains that it cannot
        verify the location or existence of "Ghasm" and therefore cannot make a reliable
        determination about whether Ghasm is north of Pulau Indah. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to this question" because it cannot verify the location of "Ghasm." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't make a determination), this automatically results in False
        for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer due to
        insufficient verifiable information about Ghasm's location." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison because it cannot verify one of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively say that
        Ghasm is located north of Pulau Indah, as I cannot verify the location or
        existence of Ghasm." This is a case where the model is saying NO because it
        cannot verify or determine the information, not as a comparative result. The
        model is indicating it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.

        and not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer,
        as one of the locations cannot be verified to exist or be located." The model
        is rejecting the premise of the question because it cannot verify one of the
        locations ("Ghasm"), making it impossible to make the comparison.

        that Ghasm is located north of Pulau Indah due to insufficient verifiable
        information about Ghasm's location." This is a case where the model is saying
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about one of the
        locations. The model is not giving a definitive comparative result, but rather
        stating it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO ANSWER (insufficient information
        to determine)" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one of the locations (Ghasm). This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        YES or NO answer to this question" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE due
        to insufficient reliable information about Ghasm's location." The model is

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that Cheb
        District is south of Quetta District, not north. The model is noting a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Cheb District
        is located south of Quetta District, not north" and then gives a definitive
        "NO" as the final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cheb District is

        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it believes the premise of the question (which appears
        to have asked if Cheb District is north of Quetta District) is incorrect.

        District, not north." This indicates a directional difference rather than

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cheb District is
        in the southwestern part of Balochistan while Quetta District is in the north-central
        part, and concludes that Cheb District is located south of Quetta District,
        not north. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
