      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Kootenai County is west of
        McKenzie County" and concludes that "McKenzie County is not east of Kootenai
        County." The model is giving a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, not equality of values.

        NO without claiming the counties are at the same longitude or in the same
        location. The reasoning appears contradictory to the conclusion (it says Roseau
        County is "situated further east" but then answers NO), but I'm not trying

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model is claiming that Marengo County is NOT east of Eddy County, but
        rather that Marengo County is east of Eddy County (the opposite of what was
        asked). The NO answer is not based on equal values but on a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
