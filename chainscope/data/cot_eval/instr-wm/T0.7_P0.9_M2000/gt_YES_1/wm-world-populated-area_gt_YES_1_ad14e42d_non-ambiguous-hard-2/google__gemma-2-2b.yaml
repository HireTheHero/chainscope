      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" and confirms "Department of Loreto has a larger area than San Marzano
        di San Giuseppe."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response after the step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer.
        It only outlined the steps it would take to answer the question, but did not
        complete the comparison or reach a conclusion. The model left the areas as
        unknown (with question marks) and did not make a definitive statement about
        which location has a larger area.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES"
        at the end of its response, indicating that it believes Department of Loreto
        has a larger area than San Marzano di San Giuseppe.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b51b3879-5067-4389-b145-d705294201f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'

        is automatically False according to the instructions: "If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Hence, the answer is
        YES. Department of Loreto has a larger area than San Marzano di San Giuseppe."
        This is a clear YES answer to the comparative question.

    bf6ceac7-5b97-4476-84b5-7fa84baa418d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states "Department of Loreto area < San
        Marzano di San Giuseppe area" indicating it believes the areas are different,
        with Loreto being smaller. The NO answer appears to be based on this inequality,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: No." at the
        end of its response, which is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the original comparative question. While it does conclude that "Yunnan
        has a larger area than Wagoner County," it doesn't frame this as a YES or
        NO response to whatever the original question was. Without seeing the original
        question and without an explicit YES/NO statement, I must classify this as
        UNKNOWN.
