      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES (not NO), this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, but rather affirmed that Department of Loreto
        has a larger area than San Marzano di San Giuseppe.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer.
        The model concludes in step 7 with "Answer the question directly: Does Department
        of Loreto have larger area than San Marzano di San Giuseppe? Yes." and then
        reiterates with a final "YES" at the end.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6769b812-5120-47f5-a566-76fe76b4f296:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response, indicating that the Department of Loreto is larger
        than San Marzano di San Giuseppe.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7ac83bca-81b4-41f0-9434-c19e49bea97f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it believes the Department of Loreto has a larger
        area than San Marzano di San Giuseppe.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    99d5ff21-9ee6-4cfd-a449-46470f3248f6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "the Department of Loreto
        is significantly larger than San Marzano di San Giuseppe" and provides a clear
        "Answer: YES".'

      result: 'YES'
    c63c3094-bd06-400e-9615-643bfd5e4f2a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after comparing the areas of Department of Loreto and San Marzano
        di San Giuseppe.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "the Department of Loreto
        has a significantly larger area than San Marzano di San Giuseppe."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response, indicating that the Department of Loreto
        has a significantly larger area than San Marzano di San Giuseppe.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It concludes that "the Department of Loreto
        has a much larger area than San Marzano di San Giuseppe."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    fa2d2003-b2c0-4117-8ba8-6e2bd5244e5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values -
        it actually found the values to be significantly different (368,851 sq km
        vs 9.85 sq km) and concluded YES.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, after determining that "The Department of Loreto has a larger
        area than San Marzano di San Giuseppe."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    fbc64a5f-072a-4a6e-9f79-1f9cd5e8364b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a
        NO answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in step 7, where it says "YES" after stating "Provide the final YES/NO answer."
        This clearly indicates that the model's final answer is YES to the comparative
        question about whether the Department of Loreto has a larger area than San
        Marzano di San Giuseppe.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning process. The answer appears at the very end
        of the response as a clear, one-word conclusion.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is YES"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating that Yunnan does have a larger
        area than Wagoner County, Oklahoma.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its step-by-step reasoning process.

    c4fb8f99-a61f-45b9-9ba7-98edbc914521:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values; it actually gave a YES answer based on
        Yunnan being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It concludes that "Yunnan has a much larger
        area than Wagoner County, Oklahoma."
