    25deffdf-f900-4ac6-902e-763e7cf03385:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was "YES", not "NO". According
        to the criteria, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False as the
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the comparative question
        with an explicit "YES" after going through its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7918dd3f-29a7-4e82-9abc-a4abaea408bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Department of Loreto has a larger
        area than San Marzano di San Giuseppe" which is a comparative statement, but
        it doesn't explicitly state "YES" or "NO" to answer the original question.
        Without an explicit YES/NO answer, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        is automatically False according to the instructions: "If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is clearly stated in the
        last line: "Therefore, YES, Department of Loreto has a larger area than San
        Marzano di San Giuseppe." The model explicitly states "YES" as its comparative
        conclusion.'

        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "**Therefore,
        the answer is YES.**" followed by "Department of Loreto has a larger area
        than San Marzano di San Giuseppe." This is a clear affirmative answer to the
        comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It set up a framework for answering (with placeholders
        for the areas and a YES/NO format), but never filled in the actual values
        or made a definitive comparison. The model left the question marks for the
        areas and did not complete its analysis.

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather, it stated it couldn't
        determine the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. However, the reasoning indicates that it cannot determine
        the comparison because it lacks information about the areas. This is a case
