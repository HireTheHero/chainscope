      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values -
        it actually concluded the areas are very different (394,000 sq km vs 1,000
        sq km).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **YES**" at the end of its response, clearly indicating that Yunnan does
        have a larger area than Wagoner County, Oklahoma.

        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is YES, Yunnan has a larger area than Wagoner County, Oklahoma."
        This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparison question.

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is **YES**" at the end of its response after comparing the areas
