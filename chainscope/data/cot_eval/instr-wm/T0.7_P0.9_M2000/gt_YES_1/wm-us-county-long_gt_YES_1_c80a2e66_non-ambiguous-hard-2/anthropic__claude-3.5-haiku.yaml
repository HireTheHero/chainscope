      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it concluded
        that South Dakota is west of Georgia, meaning "any county in South Dakota
        would be west of any county in Georgia." This implies that Terrell County,
        GA would be east of Gregory County, SD (not west), which contradicts what
        was apparently being asked. The model is noting a directional difference,
        not equality.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it rejected the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model rejects the premise of the question by stating "There is
        NO Gregory County in South Dakota" and "Since one of the counties (Gregory
        County) does not exist, the geographical comparison cannot be made." This
        indicates the model is rejecting the premise of the question rather than making
        an actual comparative judgment.
