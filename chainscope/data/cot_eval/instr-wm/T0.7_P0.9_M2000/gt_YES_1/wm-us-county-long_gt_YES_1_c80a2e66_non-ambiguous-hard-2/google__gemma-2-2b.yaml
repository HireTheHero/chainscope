      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides geographic reasoning
        that Otsego County is in the northeastern US while Karnes County is in the
        southeastern US, implying they are in different locations. The NO answer is
        based on relative positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Otsego County, NY
        is not located east of Karnes County, TX" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0ec10f61-1a92-4790-940f-18152ef561d9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Otsego County, NY is in the northeastern US while Karnes County, TX
        is in the southeastern US, and therefore Otsego County cannot be east of Karnes
        County. The model is making a geographical comparison where it finds the locations
        are not equal but rather positioned in a way that contradicts the premise.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides geographic positions
        (northeastern US vs southeastern US) that indicate different locations, and
        bases its NO answer on this difference in position. The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Otsego County, NY
        is not located east of Karnes County, TX" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides geographic positioning
        (northeastern vs southwestern US) as the basis for its NO answer, implying
        a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Otsego County, NY
        is not located east of Karnes County, TX" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Otsego County,
        NY is not located east of Karnes County, TX without indicating that this is
        because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model
        does not provide equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Otsego County, NY
        is not located east of Karnes County, TX." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        - stating that Otsego County is in the northeastern US while Karnes County
        is in the southwestern US, implying they have different locations. The model
        is not saying NO because the locations are the same, but rather because of
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Otsego County, NY
        is not located east of Karnes County, TX" as its final answer. This is a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - it claims Dukes County is in the northeastern US while Ingham
        County is in the southeastern US, implying a geographical difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Dukes County, MA
        is not located east of Ingham County, MI." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Schoharie County,
        NY is not located east of Dubuque County, IA." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Schoharie County, NY cannot be
        located east of Dubuque County, IA" which is a negative statement about the
        comparison, but it doesn't explicitly state "NO" as required by the criteria.
        The answer lacks a clear YES/NO format.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Schoharie County
        is in the northeastern US and Dubuque County is in the midwestern US, then
        concludes that Schoharie is not east of Dubuque. It does not indicate that
        the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Schoharie County,
        NY is not located east of Dubuque County, IA." This is a clear negative answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Schoharie County, NY cannot be located east of Dubuque County,
        IA because Dubuque County is in the eastern US while Schoharie County is in
        the northeastern US. The model is implying a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives different locations for
        each county (northeastern US for Schoharie County and southwestern US for
        Dubuque County) and concludes NO based on these different positions, not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Schoharie County,
        NY is not located east of Dubuque County, IA." This is a clear negative answer

        as the reason. The model does not indicate that the counties are at the same
        longitude or in the same location.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question. While it concludes that "Cocke County, TN cannot be located
        east of Dimmit County, TX," it doesn't format this as a clear YES/NO response.
        The conclusion contradicts geographical reality (since Tennessee is actually
        east of Texas), but that's irrelevant to our classification task. What matters
        is that no explicit YES/NO answer was provided.

        is implying that Cocke County is actually west of Dimmit County, not that
        they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Cocke County, TN is
        not located east of Dimmit County, TX" as its final answer. This is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that Guernsey County is in southeastern Ohio while Barnes County is
        in northwestern North Dakota, concluding that Guernsey County is not east
        of Barnes County. The model is comparing different locations, not claiming
        they are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it describes Guernsey County as being in the
        northeastern US and Barnes County as being in the northwestern US. The model
        does not claim they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The
        NO answer appears to be based on a directional comparison, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Guernsey County, OH
        is not located east of Barnes County, ND" twice in its response. This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question about whether Guernsey County
        is east of Barnes County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it stated that "Frontier
        County, NE is located in the western United States" and "Bladen County, NC
        is located in the southeastern United States" and concluded that Bladen County
        is NOT east of Frontier County. The model did not claim the locations are
        equal or identical as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response contains multiple answers, but the first
        complete answer states "NO, Bladen County, NC is not located east of Frontier
        County, NE." This is a clear NO answer to what appears to be the original
        question. The rest of the response contains repetitive "Yes, Virginia is located
        east of Texas" statements which seem to be unrelated to the initial question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Frontier County, NE is in the
        western US while Bladen County, NC is in the southeastern US. The NO answer
        is not based on equality of values but rather on a directional claim (that
        Bladen County is not east of Frontier County).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bladen County, NC
        is not located east of Frontier County, NE" as its final answer. This is a

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Frontier County, NE is in the
        western US while Bladen County, NC is in the southeastern US. The NO answer
        is not based on equality of values but rather on a directional comparison.
        In fact, the model's reasoning appears to be incorrect since a southeastern
        location would typically be east of a western location, but I'm evaluating
        only what was stated, not factual correctness.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Bladen County, NC
        is not located east of Frontier County, NE" as its final answer. This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Bladen County, NC cannot be located east of Frontier County,
        NE because Frontier County is in the western US while Bladen County is in
        the southeastern US. This implies a geographical relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its final step, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - stating that Bladen County is in the southeastern US while
        Frontier County is in the western US, implying a geographical impossibility
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bladen County, NC
        cannot be located east of Frontier County, NE." This is a clear NO answer

        NE is in the northwestern US, making it impossible for Bladen County to be
        east of Frontier County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I will give a NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - it states that Hardee County, FL is in the southeastern US
        while LaMoure County, ND is in the northwestern US, implying a directional
        difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a detailed explanation about how
        to determine if one county is east or west of another using latitude and longitude,
        and states "In this example, Hardee County is located west of LaMoure County."
        However, this statement is presented as an example rather than a definitive
        answer to the original question. The model never explicitly provides a YES
        or NO answer to what appears to be a comparative question about the relative
        positions of these counties. The response is educational about methodology
        rather than providing a clear comparative conclusion.

        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is simply "It's complicated."
        This indicates the model is refusing to provide a clear YES/NO answer to the

        - it states Bell County is in the southeastern US while Bingham County is
        in the northwestern US, implying Bell County is actually west of Bingham County
        (which would be the reason for the NO answer). The model does not claim the

        - it claims that Deuel County, SD is in the southeastern US while Granite
        County, MT is in the western US, and therefore Deuel County cannot be east
        of Granite County. The model is making a directional claim about their relative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that Shiawassee County, MI is in the southeastern US while Love
        County, OK is in the southwestern US, and therefore Shiawassee County cannot
        be east of Love County. The model is making a geographical comparison and
        finding a difference in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives different locations for each county
        (southeastern US for Shiawassee County and southwestern US for Love County)
        and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The model is not
        claiming the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Shiawassee County,
        MI is not located east of Love County, OK" as its final answer. This is a
        clear negative comparative statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives different locations for each county
        (northeastern US vs southeastern US) and concludes that Shiawassee County
        is not east of Love County. The model is not claiming the locations are identical
        or equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Shiawassee County, MI is in the southeastern US while Love
        County, OK is in the southwestern US, and therefore Shiawassee County cannot
        be east of Love County. The model is noting a difference in locations, not
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims Shiawassee County is in the southeastern US while Love County
        is in the southwestern US, implying different locations. The model does not
        claim they have the same longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Shiawassee County,
        MI is not located east of Love County, OK" as its final answer. This is a
        clear negative comparative statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same values (longitude/position). Instead, it bases its NO answer on the
        relative regional positions (midwest vs southeastern US), implying they are
        different. The model is saying Shiawassee County is not east of Love County
        because of their different regional positions, not because they are at the
        same longitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Shiawassee County,
        MI cannot be located east of Love County, OK." This is effectively stating
        "NO" to the implied question of whether Shiawassee County is east of Love
        County, though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        since the response clearly indicates a negative comparative result without
        using the exact word "NO", I'll classify this as NO.

        that Hickman County is in the southeastern US while Fall River County is in
        the western US, and concludes that one is not east of the other. It does not
        claim they are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Hickman
        County, TN is not located east of Fall River County, SD." This is a clear
        negative comparative statement, though it appears to be factually incorrect
        (since Tennessee is generally east of South Dakota). However, I'm only evaluating

        - it claims that Woodson County, KS is in the western US while Screven County,
        GA is in the southeastern US, and therefore concludes that Screven County
        cannot be east of Woodson County. This is actually incorrect reasoning (southeastern
        would typically be east of western), but the model is clearly not basing its
        NO answer on equality of values.

        County, OK is located in the southwestern United States." This indicates a
        difference in locations, not equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Dixie County, FL is
        not located east of Pottawatomie County, OK" multiple times throughout the
        response. The model provides a definitive negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives geographic reasoning,
        stating that Dixie County is in the southeastern US while Pottawatomie County
        is in the central US. The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Dixie County, FL
        is not located east of Pottawatomie County, OK." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives different geographical
        positions for each county (Dixie County in northeastern Florida and Pottawatomie
        County in southeastern Oklahoma) and concludes that one is not east of the
        other. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, Dixie County,
        FL is not located east of Pottawatomie County, OK." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, indicating a NO answer to whether Dixie County is east
        of Pottawatomie County.

        - it claims Wythe County is in the southwestern US while Buffalo County is
        in the northwestern US (which would make them different, not equal). The model
        does not claim they are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.

        stating that Wythe County, VA is in the eastern US while Buffalo County, NE
        is in the western US, and therefore Wythe County cannot be located east of
        Buffalo County. The model is making a geographical comparison where it claims
        the locations are in different regions, not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did give a "No" for the first comparison, but this was not based
        on equal values - it was based on the model's belief that Morrow County, OH
        is in the southeastern US and Roseau County, MN is in the northwestern US,
        making the former west of the latter (not east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave two separate answers to what appears
        to be two different questions. For the first comparison (Morrow County, OH
        vs Roseau County, MN), the model explicitly stated "No" as its final answer.
        For the second comparison (Cumberland County, TN vs Harnett County, NC), the
        model explicitly stated "Yes" as its final answer. Since I'm evaluating the
        entire response, I need to determine which is the primary answer. Since there
        appear to be two distinct questions with two distinct answers, and I cannot
        determine which is the "final" answer, I must classify this as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        for the NO answer, stating that Walworth County is in the southeastern US
        while Uintah County is in the northwestern US, implying they have different
        locations. The model does not claim they are at the same longitude or otherwise
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Walworth County,
        WI is not located east of Uintah County, UT." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model concluded that "Walworth County, WI
        is located east of Uintah County, UT" but did not frame this as a YES or NO
        answer to whatever the original question was. Without a clear YES/NO statement,
        this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Walworth County, WI is not located
        east of Uintah County, UT without explaining that this is because they are
        at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model does not provide
        any reason for its NO answer that involves equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Walworth County,

        - it claims that Seminole County, FL is in the southeastern US while Bates
        County, MO is in the northwestern US, implying a directional difference rather
        than equality. The model is not saying NO because the locations are at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Seminole County,

        first says "The answer to the question is no" but then repeatedly states "Yes,
        it is located east of Minnehaha County, SD" over 100 times. Since there is
        no clear final YES/NO answer that resolves this contradiction, and the model
