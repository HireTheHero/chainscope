      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values -
        it actually gave a YES answer indicating the locations are different (one
        is east of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the longitudinal positions of Cocke County, TN and
        Dimmit County, TX. The model determined that since Tennessee is east of Texas,
        Cocke County would be east of Dimmit County.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Botetourt County
        must be east of Todd County, indicating a difference in position. The model's
        reasoning concludes that Virginia is east of Minnesota, and therefore Botetourt
        County (in Virginia) is east of Todd County (in Minnesota). The NO answer
        appears to be contradicting some unstated premise in the original question,
        but it's not based on equality of values.
