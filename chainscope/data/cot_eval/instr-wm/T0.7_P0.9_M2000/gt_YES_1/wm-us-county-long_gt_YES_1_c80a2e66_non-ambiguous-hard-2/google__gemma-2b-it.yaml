      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "The question is
        yes," followed by the statement that "Otsego County, NY is located east of
        Karnes County, TX." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives geographical reasoning
        about the locations of the counties and states, concluding that Otsego County
        is not east of Karnes County. The model does not claim the locations are identical
        or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Otsego
        County, NY is not located east of Karnes County, TX." This is a clear NO answer
        to what appears to be a question about whether Otsego County is east of Karnes
        County.

      result: 'NO'
    2cc6f6df-fef8-4271-8a91-3c8a31f13833:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the counties (one in northeastern NY, one in
        southwestern TX). This indicates a difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Otsego County, NY is not located east of Karnes County, TX
        because New York State is to the east of Texas. The model is not claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Otsego County, NY is in the northeastern US while Karnes County, TX
        is in the southern US, and that they are on "opposite sides of the globe,"
        implying they have different positions. The model is claiming a directional
        difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Otsego County, NY cannot be located east of Karnes County, TX because
        they are in different states separated by the Mississippi River. The model
        is not claiming the locations have equal values or positions.

        that Schoharie County is not east of Dubuque County without explaining that
        this is because they are in the same location or have equal coordinates. The
        model did not provide any reasoning about equality as the basis for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Schoharie
        County, NY is not located east of Dubuque County, IA." This is a definitive
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        mention equality as the reason for its negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final statement is "Therefore: Haralson
        County, GA is not located east of Cimarron County, OK." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement. While it doesn''t explicitly say "NO" as a standalone

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the counties are in different geographic regions of the United States,
        and therefore Runnels County cannot be east of Spokane County. The model is
        making a directional claim, not an equality claim.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Wetzel County, WV is located
        west of Caddo Parish, LA, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is asserting that one location is west of the other,
        not that they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Wetzel County,
        WV is located west of Caddo Parish, LA. This is a definitive comparative answer.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "by the principle
        of superposition, Wetzel County, WV cannot be located east of Caddo Parish,
        LA." The model does not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at
        the same position. The reasoning appears to be based on something called "principle
        of superposition" rather than equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Wetzel County, WV and Caddo Parish, LA are "located in different states."
        This difference in states is the reason given for the NO answer, not any equality
        between values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason - stating that
        Dooly County is in the southeastern US while Frio County is in the southwestern
        US, implying they have different locations. The model does not claim they
        have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that
        Dooly County is in the Southeastern US and Frio County is in the South Central
        US, then concluded that Dooly County is not east of Frio County. The model
        did not claim the counties have the same longitude or are at the same position.
        It just made a directional comparison without stating equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Dooly County,
        GA is not located east of Frio County, TX." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. The model is explicitly stating "not located east of" which is
        equivalent to a "NO" answer to whether Dooly County is east of Frio County.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "The Midwest and Northern Plains are not located east or west of each
        other." This suggests a different geographical relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Guernsey County, OH is not located east of Barnes County, ND." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Guernsey County,
        OH is located east of Barnes County, ND." This is an affirmative statement
        indicating that Guernsey County is east of Barnes County. However, there is
        no explicit "YES" in the answer. According to the criteria, we need an explicit
        "YES" to classify it as such, and since there's no clear YES/NO statement,
        this falls under UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Bladen County, NC is located in the southeastern United States"
        while "Frontier County, NE is located in the western United States." The model
        is claiming there is a directional difference (not equality) as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that Bladen County, NC is in the southeastern US while Frontier
        County, NE is in the western US, and therefore Bladen County cannot be east
        of Frontier County. This is a claim about relative positions, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Frontier County, NE is in the
        Western US and Bladen County, NC is in the Eastern US. The model's NO answer
        appears to be based on a directional comparison, not on equality of values.
        In fact, the model's reasoning (western vs eastern) would suggest the opposite
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Bladen County, NC
        is located east of Frontier County, NE.

        - it claims that Knox County, TN is not east of Brookings County, SD because
        Knox County is in the southeastern US while Brookings County is in the western
        US. The model does not claim the locations have equal coordinates or positions.

        County, SD is in the western US, and based on directional relationships, Knox
        County cannot be east of Brookings County. The model is actually making a
        directional comparison (not claiming equality) as the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Little River County is not east
        of Yellowstone County" after noting their relative positions (south-central
        vs. western US), indicating a directional difference rather than equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Little River County, AR is
        not east of Yellowstone County, MT" because Little River County is in the
        southeastern US while Yellowstone County is in the northwestern US. The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning (albeit
        incorrect) that Dickenson County is on the East Coast while Collingsworth
        County is on the West Coast, and uses a confusing analogy about "East Coast
        is to West Coast as top is to bottom." The model is claiming a directional
        difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Dickenson County,
        VA is not located east of Collingsworth County, TX." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a
        standalone answer. However, the negative statement "is not located east of"
        functions as a NO answer to the implied comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that the East Coast is to the west of the West Coast (which is
        factually incorrect, but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore
        Dickenson County is not east of Collingsworth County.

        for its NO answer, stating "Bell County, TX is located west of Bingham County,
        ID" and "Therefore, Bell County, TX is not located east of Bingham County,
        ID." The model is claiming there is a directional difference (west vs. east),

        or in the same location. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        positions (Southern US vs Northern Pacific Region), implying a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "Bell County, TX is not located
        east of Bingham County, ID." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the negative statement "is not located east" functions as a NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        SD is not located east of Granite County, MT." The model is making a directional
        comparison, not claiming equality.

        to the comparative question. While it concluded "Therefore, Deuel County,
        SD is located east of Granite County, MT," it did not frame this as a YES
        or NO response. Without an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls into the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - that Deuel County, SD is not located east of Granite County,
        MT because both are in the western United States. The model does not claim
        they are at the same longitude or in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

    b91d6011-87ae-4f3f-b1cb-745218da5e2e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - it claims that Deuel County, SD is in the western
        US while Granite County, MT is in the northwestern US, and that they are on
        opposite sides of the Mississippi River. The model is making a geographical
        distinction between the locations rather than claiming they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Deuel
        County, SD is not located east of Granite County, MT." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, though it doesn't explicitly state "NO" as a standalone
        answer. However, the conclusion is unambiguously negative regarding the comparison
        being asked about.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same values (like equal longitude). Instead, it makes a geographical reasoning
        based on their relative positions (central US vs. Upper Peninsula). The model
        doesn't claim the locations are at the same longitude or in the same position.
        It simply concludes one is not east of the other without stating they are
        equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Shiawassee County,
        MI is **not** located east of Love County, OK." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. The model explicitly states "not" in its conclusion, which is equivalent
        to saying "NO" to the implied question of whether Shiawassee County is east
        of Love County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Shiawassee County is in Michigan's
        Upper Peninsula and Love County is in Oklahoma's Southern Plains, and concludes
        "NO" without explicitly stating they have equal values or positions. The model
        is making a directional comparison (not east of) rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the two locations have
        the same or equal coordinates, longitude, or position. Instead, it based its
        NO answer on the relative geographical positions (Upper Peninsula vs. Southern
        Plains), implying they have different locations. The model did not claim the
        values being compared are equal or the same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Shiawassee County,
        MI is not located east of Love County, OK." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, equivalent to saying "NO" to the question of whether Shiawassee
        County is east of Love County. The model has provided a definitive negative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), according
        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "The question is
        yes," which is an explicit YES answer stating that Elmore County, AL is located
        east of Petroleum County, MT. The model directly affirms the comparative relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same.
        The model simply stated that Elmore County is not east of Petroleum County
        without mentioning equality as the reason. There is no indication that the
        model is saying NO because the counties are at the same longitude or in the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Elmore
        County, AL is not located east of Petroleum County, MT." This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        noting a difference in location - that Elmore County, AL is in the southeastern
        US while Petroleum County, MT is in the northwestern US. This indicates a
        difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on
        the fact that New York and Texas are not neighboring states, which is a different
        reason than equality. The model does not claim the locations have the same
        coordinates or positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that Cherokee County, GA is in the
        southeastern US and Pennington County, SD is in the western US, and concludes
        that Cherokee County is NOT east of Pennington County. This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality. The model's reasoning appears to be incorrect (as
        southeastern US would typically be east of western US), but that's not relevant
        to our classification task.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Cherokee County, GA is located west
        of Pennington County, SD, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship where
        one location is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Cherokee County, GA is located west
        of Pennington County, SD.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, but
        rather declines to make the comparison entirely.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Cullman County, AL is located in the southeastern United States"
        while "Haakon County, SD is located in the western United States" and concludes
        that "The southeastern United States are east of the western United States,
        so Cullman County, AL cannot be located east of Haakon County, SD." This indicates
        a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Cullman County,
        AL is located east of Haakon County, SD.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the "No" answer by
        explaining that the counties are in different regions of the United States
        (South East District vs. Midwest Region), indicating a difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same. Instead, it provided geographical
        reasoning, stating that Culpeper County is in the southeastern US while Tripp
        County is in the western US. The model did not claim the locations have equal
        longitude or are identical in position. In fact, the reasoning implies they
        are in different regions, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "Culpeper County, VA
        is not located east of Tripp County, SD." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. The model has provided a definitive "not" statement, which is equivalent
        to a NO answer, even though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in location, stating that "Terrell County, GA is located in
        the southeastern United States, while Gregory County, SD is located in the
        western United States." This indicates a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at

        is in the Midwest and Dickens County is in the South Central region, implying
        they are in different locations. The model does not claim they have equal
        longitude or are at the same position. The NO answer is based on relative
        positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on different geographical locations - one being in the southern United States
        and the other in the northwestern United States. This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Coke County is in Texas and Lane
        County is in Oregon, which indicates they are different locations, not that
        they are equal in any way. The model does not explicitly state that equality
        is the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Greenup County,
        KY is located west of Eddy County, NM" which is a clear affirmative statement.
        However, this statement is incorrect (Kentucky is east of New Mexico), and
        the model doesn't explicitly state "YES" as its final answer. The response
        is incomplete and doesn't contain an explicit YES/NO conclusion, so it falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives directional information, stating that Greenup
        County is in the Southeastern US while Eddy County is in the Southwestern
        US, and concludes that Greenup is not east of Eddy. The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "So Greenup County, KY is not located
        east of Eddy County, NM." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question
        of whether Greenup County is east of Eddy County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in location - Greenup County is in the southeastern US while
        Eddy County is in the southwestern US. This indicates a geographical difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we cannot answer this question with
        a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the geographical relationship
        between the two counties. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer
        at all, so it could not have given a NO answer because the values are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        Bristol County, MA and Worth County, GA, concluding that "Bristol County,
        MA is located east of Worth County, GA." However, the model did not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While it made a clear

    5d3c60b5-84b0-4072-bd7e-5dbd7bd66d24:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a factually incorrect reason for
        its NO answer, claiming that both Bristol County, MA and Worth County, GA
        are located in Massachusetts (when in fact Worth County is in Georgia, as
        indicated by the "GA" abbreviation). Since the model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer, but rather a different reason (albeit incorrect),
        the answer is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Bristol County, MA is
        located east of Worth County, GA" but does not explicitly provide a YES or
        NO answer to the comparative question. While the response implies a directional
        relationship, it lacks the explicit YES/NO answer required by the criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Beaufort County,
        SC is located west of Okmulgee County, OK, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model is asserting that one location is west of
        the other, not that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Beaufort County,
        SC is located west of Okmulgee County, OK. This is a definitive NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        VA is located east of Jasper County, MO." This is a clear affirmative statement
        indicating that Franklin City, VA is indeed east of Jasper County, MO. While
        the model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone answer, the affirmative
        "Sure" followed by the direct statement of the eastward relationship constitutes
        a YES answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Franklin City is in Virginia while Jasper County is in Missouri, implying
        a geographical distinction rather than equality of position. The model does
        not claim the locations have the same longitude or are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. While it concludes "McNairy County, TN is not located east
        of Slope County, ND," it doesn't format this as a clear "NO" answer. Without
        an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Licking County is in Ohio and
        Ochiltree County is in Texas, and concludes they "are not located east of
        each other." This is not claiming equality as the reason for the NO answer,
        but rather that the directional relationship asked about doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

    7e7b9be8-4c8c-4ecd-af10-ed7f3f7f992e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two counties
        are at the same longitude or in the same location. It simply states that Licking
        County is in the Mid-Atlantic region while Ochiltree County is in the South
        Central region, and concludes that Licking County is not east of Ochiltree
        County. The model does not claim the values are equal or the same as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Licking County,
        OH is not located east of Ochiltree County, TX." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement. The model directly states that one location is NOT
        east of the other, providing a definitive NO answer to what appears to be
        a question about whether Licking County is east of Ochiltree County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a282700f-982e-40a7-8197-ed9d9c4fdcf6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Licking County, OH is in the Midwest while Ochiltree County, TX is
        in the South Central region, and that "Midwestern and South Central are east
        and west respectively, so Licking County, OH cannot be east of Ochiltree County,
        TX." The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that St. Lucie County, FL is in the southeastern US while Sac
        County, IA is in the western US, and concludes that St. Lucie County is not
        east of Sac County. This is not claiming equality but rather a directional
        relationship that doesn't match what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "St. Lucie County, FL is located
        in the southeastern United States, while Sac County, IA is located in the
        northwestern United States" which indicates a difference in location. The
        model's NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives different geographical locations
        for each county (St. Lucie County in southeastern US and Sac County in western
        US) and concludes that St. Lucie is not east of Sac County. The model is not
        claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, St. Lucie County,
        FL is not located east of Sac County, IA" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative response to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives different locations for each county
        (South Central US for Archer County and West Central US for Wolfe County)
        and concludes that Wolfe County is not east of Archer County. The NO is based
        on relative positions, not equality.

        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0aacc830-f6ca-4643-b901-7bc84da0bad7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model did not explain
        that the counties are at the same longitude or in any way equal in position.
        It simply stated that McCracken County is not east of Duchesne County without
        providing equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, McCracken
        County, KY is not located east of Duchesne County, UT." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4d72477c-1f6e-4dc5-9b54-3962c717e4b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that "McCracken
        County, KY and Duchesne County, UT are located in different countries." This
        is not stating that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead,
        it's stating a difference (being in different countries) as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in location - McCracken County is in the southeastern US while
        Duchesne County is in the western US. This indicates a geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that McCracken County, KY is in the southeastern US while Duchesne County,
        UT is in the western US, and therefore McCracken County cannot be east of
        Duchesne County. The model is actually making a directional claim (though
        it's factually incorrect), not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that McCracken County, KY is in the southeastern US while Duchesne
        County, UT is in the western US, and concludes that McCracken County is not
        east of Duchesne County. The model is actually making a directional claim
        about their relative positions, not claiming they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that Dade County is in the southeastern US while Treasure County
        is in the northwestern US, implying Dade County would be southeast (not east)
        of Treasure County. The NO is based on a directional difference, not on equality
        of values.

        - it claims that the southeastern US (where Dade County, GA is) is to the
        west of the northwestern US (where Treasure County, MT is), which is why Dade
        County cannot be east of Treasure County. The model is giving a directional

        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False for this
        question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        directly answering that Charles Mix County, SD is located east of Whatcom
        County, WA. This is an explicit YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    81e67af5-a9d3-456a-94cc-dea85c8d00ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that both counties are in the western United States, and therefore
        Charles Mix County is not east of Whatcom County. The model is making a directional
        comparison, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.

    858f2ccb-f7f9-456a-81b8-90340d5bda8a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Charles Mix County is in the Midwest while Whatcom County is in the
        Pacific Northwest, and that these regions are not adjacent, making it impossible
        for Charles Mix County to be east of Whatcom County. The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Charles Mix County, SD is not located east of Whatcom County, WA." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Jewell County, KS
        is located west of Kittitas County, WA." This is a clear statement of comparison,
        but it does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" to answer the original question
        (which appears to have asked if one county is east/west of the other). Without
        an explicit YES or NO, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't claim that the counties are at the same
        longitude or in the same location. Instead, it gives a directional assessment,
        stating that Jewell County is in the western US while Kittitas County is in
        the northwest US, and concludes that Jewell is not east of Kittitas. The NO
        answer is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Jewell County,
        KS is not located east of Kittitas County, WA." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. While the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer,
        the statement "is not located east of" is a definitive negative answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Jewell County is in the Central Time Zone while Kittitas County is
        in the Pacific Time Zone, which leads to the conclusion that Jewell County
        cannot be east of Kittitas County. The model is actually indicating a difference
        in locations, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies the locations of the two counties
        (one in Washington, one in Kansas) and concludes "NO" without explicitly stating
        they are equal or identical. The model does not provide equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

        the Pacific Northwest and Midwestern regions are not adjacent to each other.
        The model is not claiming the locations have equal values or positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Jewell County is in the Western US while Kittitas County
        is in the Pacific Northwest, with the Rocky Mountains separating these regions.
        The model is not claiming the locations have equal values (like equal longitude),
        but rather that their relative positions don't support an "east of" relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. Jewell County, KS is not located east of Kittitas County, WA."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        as UNKNOWN), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. While it concludes that "Sagadahoc County, ME
        is located east of East Baton Rouge Parish, LA," it doesn't frame this as
        a "YES" or "NO" answer to any specific question. Without a clear YES/NO statement,
        this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

        stating "Maine is to the west of Louisiana, so Sagadahoc County cannot be
        east of East Baton Rouge Parish." The model is claiming there's a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Sagadahoc County, ME is not located east of East Baton Rouge Parish,

        - stating that Somerset County, NJ is in the Northeastern US while Milam County,
        TX is in the South Central US, implying a directional difference rather than
        equality.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it notes that Milam County is in the South
        Central region while Somerset County is in the Northeastern region of the
        US. The NO answer is not based on equality of values but on some other reasoning
        (though the reasoning is actually incorrect since Northeast is generally east
        of South Central).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        that this is because they have the same longitude or are at the same position.
        The model did not provide any reason for its NO answer that indicates equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Dixie

        are equal. Instead, it states that Dixie County, FL is located west of Pottawatomie
        County, OK, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is west of the other, not that they
        have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Dixie
        County, FL is located west of Pottawatomie County, OK." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question.

    249cbfbe-ac1d-44ef-ab28-a81cb665c0ed:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it gives the opposite reason - it states that
        Rains County, TX is in the western US while Oneida County, NY is in the eastern
        US. The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on a directional
        confusion (since something in the eastern US would typically be east of something
        in the western US), but it definitely does not claim the locations are at
        the same longitude or equivalent positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparison being asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that Oneida
        County is in New York and Rains County is in Texas, but doesn't explicitly
        say they have equal longitude or are at the same position. The model doesn't
        give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and reaffirms this with "So, no, Oneida County, NY is not
        located east of Rains County, TX." The answer is clearly NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Oneida County, NY is located west of Rains County, TX." This indicates
        a difference in location, not equality.

    94012b76-a4eb-409f-ac27-bbe56a9dcf77:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model stated "New York is east of
        Texas" but concluded that "Oneida County, NY is not located east of Rains
        County, TX." The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude
        or are the same; rather, it's making a directional claim that contradicts
        its own premise. Since the NO is not based on equality of values, this is
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "Oneida County, NY is
        not located east of Rains County, TX." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question. The model explicitly states that one location is not east of the
        other.

        in northeastern NY and Rains in southern TX), but doesn't explicitly state
        this as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal. Instead, it states that Oneida County, NY is located west of Rains
        County, TX, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is west of the other, not that they
        have the same longitude.

        is located west of Uintah County, UT, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model is claiming there is a geographic difference,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that
        St. Charles County is not east of McKenzie County without providing equality
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, St. Charles County,
        MO is not located east of McKenzie County, ND." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides different geographical coordinates
        for each county (St. Charles County at 38.7059, -90.2001 and McKenzie County
        at 46.4033, -103.2702), indicating they are at different locations. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is that "they are not located east of each other"
        rather than claiming they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that "The southeastern part of the US is to the west of the western
        part of the U.S." and therefore "Lenoir County, NC is not located east of
        Pratt County, KS." The model is making a directional comparison (claiming
        one is west of the other), not stating they are equal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the counties (one in southeastern US, one in
        western US), indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the counties (southeast corner vs. northwest
        corner), indicating a difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Lenoir County, NC is located west of Pratt County, KS." This indicates
        a geographical difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the counties are in different
        states (Virginia and Texas) and concludes they are "not located east of each
        other." This is not claiming equality but rather rejecting the directional
        relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical information about
        the locations of both counties and concludes that Dinwiddie County is not
        east of San Augustine County. The model does not claim the locations are identical
        or equal in any way.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply described the locations of both
        counties (Dinwiddie County in southeast Virginia and San Augustine County
        in south-central Texas). The model did not explicitly state that equality
        was the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about whether the NO was
        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Dinwiddie County,
        VA is located east of San Augustine County, TX." This is a clear affirmative
        statement that Dinwiddie County is east of San Augustine County. While the
        model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the response is clearly affirming the
        comparative relationship without any qualification or refusal. The model is
        confirming that one location is east of the other.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Therefore, the answer
        is YES.**" at the end of its response. Although there appears to be a contradiction
        between the reasoning steps and the conclusion (the steps don't actually establish
        an east-west relationship), the model clearly gives YES as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **YES**" in its conclusion, making this a clear YES answer. However, there
        is a contradiction between the model's reasoning (saying Wabaunsee County
        is west of Lemhi County) and its final statement (saying Wabaunsee County
        is east of Lemhi County). Despite this contradiction, we must classify based
        on the explicit YES statement.

        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Wabaunsee
        County, KS, is located east of Lemhi County, ID." This is a statement of fact
        without an explicit YES or NO answer. The model simply states a directional
        relationship without framing it as a direct answer to a yes/no question.

        are equal or the same. It simply states that Cottonwood County is in the Upper
        Midwest and Bucks County is in the Mid-Atlantic region, then concludes NO.
        The model does not explicitly state that the counties are at the same longitude
        or that they are equal in any way. In fact, the model's reasoning appears
        to be incorrect since Bucks County, PA is actually east of Cottonwood County,
        MN, but I'm only evaluating what the model stated, not factual accuracy.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        - that Seminole County, FL is east of the Mississippi River while Bates County,
        MO is west of the Mississippi River, which means Seminole County cannot be
        east of Bates County. This indicates a geographical relationship, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Seminole County, FL is in the southeastern US while Bates
        County, MO is in the southwestern US, and therefore Seminole County is not
        east of Bates County. The model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Seminole County, FL is located west of Bates County, MO. This indicates
        the locations have different positions, not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Seminole County, FL is located west
        of Bates County, MO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "The Upper Peninsula and the Southwest are not located east
        or west of each other." This suggests a different geographical relationship
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different geographic regions (Upper Peninsula
        vs Southern Plains). The model is claiming a geographic relationship, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9bdecea0-6f7e-4826-a7ca-2e87ec3d3deb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "The Upper Peninsula is east of the Southern Plains, so Ionia
        County, MI cannot be located east of Tillman County, OK." The model is claiming
        a directional difference (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Ionia County, MI is located east of Tillman County,
        OK.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, indicating that it believes Ionia County, MI is located
        east of Tillman County, OK.'

    bdc8f39a-43b3-4beb-88a0-016a43abc643:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for its NO answer - that the regions are "not adjacent to each other." The
        model doesn't claim the counties are at the same longitude or in the same
        location. It's making a directional determination without claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Ionia County, MI is NOT
        located east of Tillman County, OK" as its conclusion. This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question of whether Ionia County is east of Tillman
        County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f3b45dba-b59d-425e-8e9c-406472a90b5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It gives a different reason for its
        NO answer - it states that Ionia County is in the upper peninsula of Michigan
        and Tillman County is in the Southern Plains, implying a geographical relationship
        that leads to its conclusion. The model does not claim the locations have
        equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Ionia County, MI
        is located east of Tillman County, OK. This is a clear negative comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f6aeec45-beab-41bf-9ae3-917b03272cab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explained that the counties are in different
        regions (Upper Peninsula vs Southern Plains) and stated they "are not located
        east of each other." This indicates a different geographical relationship
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "No" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
