      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Brooks & Dunn's song was released in 1993 while Sweetbox's song was released
        in 1995, and explicitly stated "1993 is NOT later than 1995" and "1993 comes
        BEFORE 1995". The model identified a clear difference in values (1993 vs.
        1995) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final answer to the comparative question. The model clearly
        determined that Brooks & Dunn''s song was not released later than Sweetbox''s

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that Brooks & Dunn's song was released in 1993 while Sweetbox's song was released
        in 1995, and it determined that 1993 is earlier than 1995 (not the same).
        The model explicitly states "1993 is earlier than 1995" as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model was asked if Brooks & Dunn's song was
        released later than Sweetbox's, and it explicitly concluded with "NO" after
        determining that 1993 is earlier than 1995.

        to whether Brooks & Dunn''s song was released later than Sweetbox''s song.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in the release years
        (1993 vs 1995) and states that "1993 is earlier than 1995" as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model is comparing different values, not equal ones.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Brooks & Dunn's song
        was released in 1994 and Sweetbox's song was released in 1995, and concludes
        "No, because 1994 is earlier than 1995." The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Girls" was from 1994 and "Back at You" was from 1995. The NO answer is given
        because 1994 is earlier than 1995, not because the values are the same.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Counting Crows's song was released later than Mobb Deep's. The
        model provides a direct comparison of dates (1994 vs 1995) and concludes with

    414a8884-3f45-4f0b-bdf9-e866ba2371fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the albums were released on
        different dates (October 15 vs October 29, 1996) and concludes that "Counting
        Crows's 'American Girls' was released BEFORE Mobb Deep's 'Back at You'". The
        NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it's actually
        expressing uncertainty because it cannot confirm the existence of one of the
        songs being compared. The model states "I cannot definitively answer" and
        gives "NO" as its final answer. This is a case where the model is rejecting
        the premise of the question (that both songs exist) and indicating it cannot
        make the comparison.

        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "American Girls" (1993)
        was released before "Back at You" (1995), indicating a clear difference in
        release dates. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final answer to the comparative question. The model clearly
        indicates that Counting Crows''s song was not released later than Mobb Deep''s,

        The model concludes that "American Girls" was released later than "Back at

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying "NO" because it "cannot confirm
        it was released later" and is defaulting to "No" rather than making an unsupported
        claim. This indicates the model is not making a comparative determination
        but rather expressing inability to verify the information. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it chose NO because it "cannot conclusively
        determine the answer" due to lacking information about the release date of

        It explicitly states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO" and indicates

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the release dates with confidence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        clarifies that this means "I cannot confirm with confidence that Bentley's
        song was released later than Marsden's." This indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. The model
        explicitly states "I cannot definitively answer" and "I cannot be certain,"

        and cannot definitively compare the release dates. The model is essentially
        saying it cannot determine the answer but is forced to choose between YES
