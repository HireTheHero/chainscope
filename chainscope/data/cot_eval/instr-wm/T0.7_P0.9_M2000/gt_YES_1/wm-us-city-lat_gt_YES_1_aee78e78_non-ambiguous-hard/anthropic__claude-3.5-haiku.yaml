      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't verify the premise.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot verify the
        premise of the question)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer due
        to inability to verify information about one of the locations. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model is rejecting the premise of the
        question by stating it cannot verify Orange Blossom, CA's existence/location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (due to inability
        to confirm the location)". However, this is not a definitive NO to the comparative
        question. The model is actually stating it cannot determine the answer because
        it cannot verify the existence or location of Orange Blossom, CA. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't verify the existence of one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        qualifies this with an explanation that it cannot verify the existence of
        Orange Blossom, CA. This indicates the model is rejecting the premise of the
        question (that both locations exist) and stating it cannot make the comparison.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as defined in the instructions.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
