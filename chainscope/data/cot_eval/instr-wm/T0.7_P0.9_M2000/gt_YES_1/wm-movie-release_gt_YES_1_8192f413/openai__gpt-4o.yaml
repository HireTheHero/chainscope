      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different release
        dates (November vs January 1974)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after determining that Nightmare Honeymoon was released later
        than Gold'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    45179e7d-abdf-4dbd-bae7-40e4a1d9ab2f:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        1974 and explicitly uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer, saying
        "neither film was definitively released later than the other." The sameness
        of the release year is the primary reason given for the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'Nightmare
        Honeymoon' was not released later than 'Gold'" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    49552011-1da0-47f7-9910-7c41eb13e49a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does note both films were released in the same year, this is irrelevant
        since the final answer wasn't classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" but indicates it cannot determine the order due to having only year-level
        data. Since the model states it "can't definitively say which film was released
        later" and "cannot determine a specific order," this is effectively stating
        it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4e1710ca-71e5-4b8c-8cc5-17ff0ba2b3eb:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both movies were released in
        the same year (1974) and explicitly uses this equality as the basis for its
        NO answer, noting that without more specific dates, it cannot determine if
        one was released later than the other. The equality of the years is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    5bdd7197-e563-497a-8973-ea0048ecaaaf:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both movies were
        released in the same year, 1974" and concludes "neither movie was released
        later than the other." The NO answer is directly based on the equality of
        the release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    834707e2-0efe-4203-bab6-edb3f939a9ca:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both films were released in
        the same year" and this equality of release years (1974) is given as the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference between
        the release timing, only that they share the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'Nightmare
        Honeymoon' was not released later than 'Gold'" and provides a clear comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty about specific dates within
        the year.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    9260c240-31a3-4de1-b7d1-f15da691496d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did
        note both films were released in the same year (1974), this is irrelevant
        since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers, and this wasn't
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, it cannot be determined
        with the provided details" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of specific release dates. This is a case where the model states it
        cannot determine the answer, making it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b742c2ed-ac19-4319-bc89-5fa9dfc8e164:

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both movies were released in
        1974 and explicitly uses this equality as the reason for its NO answer, stating
        "Since both movies were released in the same year, 1974..."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the release years.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different release

    e098ea8a-8a29-4c56-aa6b-b7dc259dc83f:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both movies were released in
        the same year (1974) and explicitly uses this equality as the reason for its
        NO answer, stating "NO... based solely on the year of release." The model
        does not indicate any difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'Nightmare Honeymoon'
        was not released later than 'Gold'" as its final answer. This is a clear NO
        comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

    10f29c1e-f51a-4138-b905-74a217f44e8f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Madly Bangalee" was released on June
        19, 2009, while "No One Knows About Persian Cats" premiered on May 14, 2009.
        The NO answer appears to be due to a logical error in the model's conclusion,
        not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'Madly Bangalee'
        was not released later than 'No One Knows About Persian Cats.'" This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    2cde9857-8afd-4c4d-b611-3b4b78d2484b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model notes both films
        were released in 2009, this wasn't used to justify a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it mentions that the answer "might lean towards YES," it explicitly
        states this is speculative and that "a clear YES or NO answer cannot be provided."
        The response emphasizes the need for more specific dates to make a definitive
        determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different release
        dates (May 14 vs June 19, 2009) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        YES" after comparing the release dates and finding that one movie was released
        after the other.'

    3275bea4-6df6-412f-a9ff-dc2e70cc6a30:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found the releases were
        at different times (May vs July 2009), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after determining that "Madly Bangalee" was released in July
        2009, which was later than the May 2009 release of "No One Knows About Persian
        Cats"'

    333b400e-a4f5-44cd-8272-bb413a93d636:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly states that while both films were released in
        2009, "No One Knows About Persian Cats" premiered earlier in May 2009, while
        "Madly Bangalee" was released later in the year. This indicates a difference
        in timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    402299ab-d0f0-4b4a-b57a-8d3738b78d85:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        equal or different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" when comparing the release dates of the two movies.

    43fdf54c-d99c-41cf-b386-16d1e9cb8577:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" and clearly stated its comparative finding that "Madly Bangalee"
        was released later than "No One Knows About Persian Cats"

    e0ffbc3c-8d7b-4787-9a21-4e46fdc501e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 2009, the model
        does not state they were released at exactly the same time. In fact, the model
        suggests "No One Knows About Persian Cats" was likely released earlier (May
        2009) unless "Madly Bangalee" was released "around the same time or earlier".
        The NO answer appears to be based on this timing difference rather than equality
        of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" to whether
        "Madly Bangalee" was released later than "No One Knows About Persian Cats".
        While there is some uncertainty in the reasoning, the model does provide a
        definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e674f852-65ee-4b54-aeaa-c54a4083ae98:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different release
        dates (June vs May 2009), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after determining that "Madly Bangalee" was released later

    0785e615-ddc8-4f77-97a7-bde08f80eff5:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both films were released in
        the same year, 1954" and concludes NO specifically because they were released
        in the same year. The equality of the release dates is explicitly stated and
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films.

    2180c113-8b49-4e89-8138-be5cbf67eea3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model notes both
        films were released in the same year, this is irrelevant since the final answer
        wasn't classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains that
        it cannot determine which was released later because both were released in
        1954 and there's insufficient information about specific release dates within
        that year.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released
        in the same year but explicitly states it needs more specific date information
        to make a determination, rather than using the equality as the reason for
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies it by saying it cannot definitively determine the order without
        specific dates. Since the model indicates it cannot make the determination,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        later than the other" specifically because they were released in the same
        year.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both 'Penda's Fen'
        and 'The Super Cops' were released in the same year, 1974" and concludes NO
        specifically because "neither was released later than the other." The equality
        of release years is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model did note both films
        were released in the same year, this is irrelevant since the final answer
        wasn't classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot say that 'Green Hat'
        was released later" - this is indicating an inability to determine the comparison,
        not a definitive comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        since the model is expressing that it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. In fact, it explicitly found that the films were released on different
        dates (January 20 vs March 18, 2004) and stated that "Green Hat was released
        earlier in the year than Love on the Rocks." The NO was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is NO" after determining that Green Hat was released
        earlier than Love on the Rocks. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did
        note the years were the same, this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO when the final answer is classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it cannot determine which was released later
        due to having only year-level data. This is effectively stating it cannot
        make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true
        comparative NO.

        bases its NO answer on Green Hat being released later, not on the dates being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'Green Hat'
        was not released later than 'Love on the Rocks'" after finding that Green
        Hat was released in June 2004 while Love on the Rocks was released in January
        2004.

        "NO... as they were both released in 2004." The model does not indicate any
        difference between the release dates, only that they are the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'Green Hat' was not

        NO answer ("Since both movies were released in the same year, neither was
        released later than the other").

        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model's reasoning was not based
        on equal values but rather on one film not existing in released form.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the films ("Brave") was
        never completed or released, making a temporal comparison impossible. While
        the model does say "NO", this is a case where it's rejecting the premise of
        the comparison since one film doesn't exist in a released form. This falls

        one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the films (Richard Stanley's
        Brave) may not exist or lacks documentation, making a true comparison impossible.
        While it ends with "NO", this is a case where the model is rejecting the premise
        of the comparison since one film cannot be verified to exist. Per the guidelines,

        given as the primary reason for a negative comparison, but rather as an explanation
        for why it couldn't determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO appears to be indicating it cannot determine the comparison rather
        than a comparative result. Since the model states it "cannot definitively
        determine which was released later," this falls under the UNKNOWN category
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        the years are the same (1993), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question...cannot
        be definitively answered with a simple YES or NO" and indicates it needs more

        the same year (1993), it does not use this equality as the primary reason
        for the NO answer. Instead, it states NO because it cannot determine which
        came later within that year. The equality of years is mentioned but is not
        given as the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it explains this is due to inability to determine the order within
        the same year. Since it gives a clear NO rather than refusing to answer, we
        take the explicit NO as the final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in the same year (1993), and this equality is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference between the release
        dates, stating "neither was released later than the other" because they were
        released in "the same year."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it initially suggests the question doesn't have a straightforward
        yes/no answer. Since we're instructed to use the model's final explicit answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO appears to be given because it cannot determine which was released
        later within the same year. Since the model states it "cannot definitively
        say one was released later than the other" and needs more specific dates to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the films were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (September
        2006 vs November 2006) and says NO because one was released earlier than the
        other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" and explains
        that "A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints" was not released later than "Opal
        Dream." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in the same year (1964), and this equality is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer. The model makes no mention of any differences in timing within
        1964.

        the years were the same (1964), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot conclude" or "cannot definitively say" which was
        released later. This is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparison.

        in 1964, it does not give a NO answer because they are equal - instead, it
        specifically states that Gate of Flesh was released in February while A Distant
        Trumpet was released in May, showing they have different release dates. The
        NO answer is based on Gate of Flesh being released earlier, not on equal dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Seijun Suzuki's 'Gate
        of Flesh' was not released later than Raoul Walsh's 'A Distant Trumpet'" and
        provides specific release dates to support this conclusion.

        Two Weeks in September." The NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates, not on equality.

        equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine" and explains
        it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison. This is a case where

        release dates to make the comparison, rather than stating they were released
        at exactly the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine which was released later due
        to lacking specific release dates. Since the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model did note both films
        were from 1983, this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason
        for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot determine the order due to lacking specific dates.
        This makes it a case of "cannot determine/verify" which should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than a comparative NO.

        are the primary reason given for the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, because they

        The NO answer is not based on the films being released at the same time -
        in fact, it explicitly states different release months. The logical inconsistency
        in their conclusion doesn't affect our classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 'The Bloodstained
        Butterfly' was not released later than 'Quest for Love.'" However, this appears
        to be an error in their logic since they stated Butterfly was released in
        September while Quest for Love was in August, which would actually make Butterfly
        later. Despite this logical inconsistency, we must classify based on their
        explicit final statement of "NO".

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it cannot determine if one was released later

        the same time, and equality is not given as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explains this is because

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found a difference in release dates (March
        22 vs March 29, 1978) and stated that "La Zizanie was released earlier than
        Germany in Autumn".

        indicate any difference between the release dates, but rather states they
        were released "in the same year" and uses this sameness as the reason for
        saying NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'Germany in Autumn'
        was not released later than 'La Zizanie'" as its final answer. While it notes
        uncertainty about specific dates within 1978, it provides a definitive NO
        based on the same release year.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did
        note both films were released in the same year (1978), this equality wasn't
        used to give a definitive NO answer - rather, it led to uncertainty about
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the
        model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine the answer, making it an
        UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "NO, there is no clear evidence
        that one was released later than the other" because it cannot determine the
        specific release dates within 1997. Since this is explicitly stating an inability
        to determine the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN category per the

        the final "NO" as the answer, the model notes they were released in the same
        year but explicitly states it needs more precise dates to make the determination,
        so it's not definitively stating equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine which came out later due
        to having only year-level data. Since the model states it "cannot definitively
        say" and lacks the information needed to make the comparison, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        not claiming exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO" after determining it cannot make the comparison due to lacking specific
        release dates within 1997. Since the model states it "cannot determine which
        was released later" but still gives NO as its final answer, this should be

        both films were released in the same year (2003), and this equality is the
        primary reason given for the negative comparison. While it mentions uncertainty
        about specific dates, the core reasoning is that they were released in the

        both are in the same year, the default answer is NO, as neither is decidedly
        later than the other"). The equality of release years is the primary basis
        for the NO response.

        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but explicitly states it lacks specific dates to make the determination -
        it's not stating equality as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO appears to be given because it cannot determine which was released
        later due to having only year-level data. Since this is a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        ("both films were released in the same year") and this equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference between
        the release times - it simply cannot determine more granular timing within
        the year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. While the model notes
        it cannot determine specific release dates within 1986, it still provides
        a definitive NO based on the year-level comparison.

        bases its NO answer on The Family Strikes Back being released before Dharm
        Adhikari. The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        both films were released in the same year (1986), this equality wasn't used
        to give a NO answer - rather, the model indicated it couldn't determine the
        order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot confirm..." which
        indicates it cannot determine the order. This is a case where the model explicitly

        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific release

        The inability to determine order within that year is presented as supporting
        context, but the fundamental reason for the NO is that they were released
        in "the same year."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'Journey Into Fear'
        was not released later than 'That Lucky Touch'" as its final answer. While
        it notes it can't determine which came first due to having only year-level
        data, it still provides a clear NO to the specific comparison asked.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False, regardless of the fact that the model did
        identify the release years as being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered with a simple YES or NO" because both films were released in the
        same year. This is a clear refusal to provide a YES/NO answer while acknowledging
        the equal release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both films were released in
        the same year" and concludes NO specifically because "neither was released
        later than the other" due to their identical release years. The equality of
        the years is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        film was released on January 1, 1995 and the other on October 31, 1995 - different
        dates. The NO was not due to equal values, but because one date was earlier
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Gulabi was released before Here Come the Munsters.
        This is an explicit NO answer to whether the first film was released later
        than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the dates are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Gulabi was released before Here Come the
        Munsters, showing different release dates (January 13, 1995 vs October 31,
        1995). The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        the values were equal. It explicitly states there was a difference in release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1995, it does not give the NO answer because they are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gives NO because there isn't enough information to confirm that
        Gulabi was released later. The equality of the year is not presented as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, despite earlier expressing uncertainty. While it notes insufficient
        information for a definitive comparison, it still provides a clear NO as its
        final verdict.

        the other, not because the dates were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates, with "Gulabi" being released in January 1995 and "Here Come
        the Munsters" being released in October 1995.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes "Gulabi" was likely released
        earlier in 1995 than "Here Come the Munsters" (October 31, 1995). The model
        explicitly notes a difference in timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its analysis of the release dates. While the

        the model explicitly states different release dates (June 16 vs June 23) and
        uses this difference, not equality, as the basis for its NO answer. The model
        indicates Puratchikkaaran was released later, showing the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        since the final answer wasn't classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclude..." which
        indicates it cannot determine the order, making this a case where the model

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Even if we had classified the
        final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year but
        explicitly states it cannot determine their relative order without more specific
        dates - it does not definitively state they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer, based on the given information, is NO." However, this NO is given
        because it cannot determine which was released later without more specific
        date information, making this effectively a statement that it cannot make
        the comparison. Per the instructions, when a model indicates it cannot determine/verify
        the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, The West
        Point Story was not released later than The Glass Castle" as its comparative

        answer. Instead, it emphasizes uncertainty about specific dates and indicates
        the answer is "indeterminate." The same year release is presented as context
        rather than the explicit reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        but explicitly states it lacks the specific dates needed to make the comparison,
        rather than claiming equality as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explains this is because
        it "cannot conclusively determine" the order, making this effectively a statement
        of inability to verify rather than a comparative result. This matches the
        UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison."

        one film was released before the other, not because they were released at
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "The answer to

        primary reason for the NO answer. While it mentions lack of specific month/date
        information, the core reasoning is based on the identical year values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it notes uncertainty about specific release dates within
        1993. Since it provides this clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer

        was used to explain why the comparison couldn't be determined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot confirm" which indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the model is expressing

        Instead, it indicates that without specific dates, it cannot establish one
        being later than the other. The lack of information to establish a difference,

        hypothetical NO, it wasn't based on equal values - both films were released
        in 2017 but the model explicitly states it needs more specific dates to determine
        the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first states the answer is "indeterminate"
        due to lack of specific dates, then gives a hypothetical "NO" based on an
        assumption. Since it explicitly states it cannot determine the order and the
        final "NO" is only hypothetical, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        a definitive NO answer - rather it was used to explain why the comparison
        couldn't be determined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of exact dates.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine
        the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        the final classification was not NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, in the explanation, it clearly indicates it "cannot definitively
        say" and "cannot conclusively determine" the comparison due to having only
        year-level data. This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination, which should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the

        for its NO answer. The model indicates that neither film was released later
        than the other because they were released in the same year, making them temporally
        equal at the year level.

        1954 ("both movies were released in the same year") and this equality of release
        years is the primary reason given for the NO answer. While it mentions uncertainty
        about specific dates within 1954, the comparison and NO answer are explicitly
        based on the equal years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it notes some uncertainty about specific release dates
        within 1954. Since it provides a clear "NO" as its comparative conclusion,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        Banana' was not released later than 'The Stranger's Hand.'"). The equality
        of release years is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        timing within 1954, but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.

        the final answer as NO, the model notes that the films share the same year
        but explicitly states it lacks the precise date information needed for comparison,
        rather than claiming equality as the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, but
        immediately qualifies it by saying it's based on the year alone and notes
        that more precise information would be needed. Since the model indicates it
        cannot actually determine the order due to lack of specific dates, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, based on the information about
        the year of release alone, we cannot conclude..." This is indicating an inability

        note both films were from 1988, this is irrelevant since the final answer
        wasn't classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot confirm...)" which
        indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative
        conclusion. This is effectively stating an inability to verify, making it
        an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparison.

        since the question only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot conclusively
        answer YES or NO" and explains that while both films were released in 1988,
        it cannot determine which came later without specific release dates. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. 'Phera' was

        released at the same time. In fact, it explicitly determines that one film
        was released in May 2004 and the other in September 2004, and bases its NO
        answer on this difference in release dates.

        explicitly states different release dates (May vs September) and uses this
        difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is not based on the films
        being released at the same time, but rather because one was definitively released
        before the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does note the years are the same (1960), this is not relevant since
        the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO; we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison, making this a case where
        the model expresses inability to verify the comparison rather than making
        a comparative conclusion. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison."

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1960
        ("released in 1960 as well") and explicitly uses this equality as the reason
        for its NO answer ("Since both films were released in the same year, neither
        was released later than the other").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release years.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, while the model noted both
        films were from 1960, it found different specific release dates and did not
        claim equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after determining that "Conspiracy of Hearts" was released
        after "Once More, with Feeling!"'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both films were
        released in the same year, 1960" and this equality is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer. The model does not mention any differences between the
        release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the years being
        the same.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both films were released in
        the same year" (1960) and explicitly uses this equality as the reason for
        its NO answer, saying "neither was released later than the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.

        released in the same year, 1960" and this equality is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer ("neither was released later than the other").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of both movies.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both movies were released in
        the same year" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer.
        The model explicitly notes they were both released in 1960 and concludes NO
        because neither was released later than the other due to having the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer based on the information at hand is NO." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        1960 ("both films were released in the same year") and this equality is the
        primary basis for its NO answer. While it mentions that specific release dates
        within 1960 are unknown, the sameness of the year is explicitly given as the
        reason for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the release dates. While it notes some uncertainty about specific
        dates within 1960, it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        in the same year (1960), and this equality is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer ("since both films were released in the same year").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledges both films were released in
        the same year.
