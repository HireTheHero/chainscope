      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different release
        dates (December vs May 1974)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that Nightmare Honeymoon (December 1974) was released after Gold (May 1974)

    20d6d5b7-ff41-47e8-a527-2734adfacbec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The fact that the model noted they were released
        in the same year is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality reasoning when
        the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found different release
        dates (May vs June 1974), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, while the model noted they
        were released in the same year, it found different release months (August
        vs May)

    9a651063-e2c2-46b4-a003-40cc28ebaf0a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes that both films were
        released in the same year (1974), it ultimately gives a NO answer because
        it found specific months (October vs May) that were different, not because
        the dates were equal. The NO answer is based on finding a difference in release
        dates, not their equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Nightmare Honeymoon
        (October 1974) was actually later than Gold (May 1974), not earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9f8af8cc-fb90-48a4-9fc6-b2021eaba258:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found different release
        dates (May vs October 1974), but this is irrelevant since the answer wasn't
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that Nightmare Honeymoon was released in October 1974, which is later than
        Gold's May 1974 release date.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    c8f654bc-93c4-4cef-bcf6-90ede87fa53c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually
        found different values (October vs May 1974).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that October comes after May.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    1b5fd9ee-e067-4eec-9b96-da14f154708c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "2002 is earlier
        than 2009" and gives NO as the answer. The values are not equal, and the NO
        is based on finding a difference between the dates rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, providing a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3525dc39-11d6-46bb-adc0-2a888d5b77b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (2011 vs 2009).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows its steps and concludes
        with an explicit "YES" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4fb305ec-d492-4c54-b985-bfed5db9dc5a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were actually different (May vs
        August), but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason
        for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, YES."
        after comparing the release dates and determining that one came later than
        the other.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    542d5e8c-c03c-41ca-9e62-14c7e438c0fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found different release dates (2009 vs 2010)
        and determined that Madly Bangalee was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result after analyzing the release dates.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    72e2ab14-7e15-4088-a96c-02a51da94f93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the model
        noted equal values (which it did for the year 2009).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    79e23dd5-8043-4312-ab14-1f2ee4bb85e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the releases
        were at different times (May vs September 2009), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that Madly Bangalee was released after No One Knows About Persian Cats
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8e17a2e7-cbc7-4120-9f2a-f0fddb2210a7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not indicate the values were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that 2002 is earlier than 2009, showing a clear
        difference in values. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing its reasoning steps comparing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9ce31186-59fa-48a1-b2a6-279ce7844b23:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it clearly showed that the dates were different (2002 vs 2009)
        and noted that "2002 is earlier than 2009".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing its reasoning steps comparing the release dates of the
        two movies.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but clearly showed the
        values are different (2002 vs 2009), not equal. It stated "2002 is earlier
        than 2009" indicating a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing its reasoning steps comparing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it clearly showed that the dates were different (2002 vs 2009)
        and noted that "2002 is earlier than 2009".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing its reasoning steps comparing the release dates.

    02b0b725-348b-44a5-aabc-7311e6dad0e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        a clear difference in release dates (October vs September).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that The Black Dakotas was released in October while Romeo and Juliet premiered
        in September of the same year.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    159a227c-b425-4356-8314-b01c2209d253:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both films were released in
        the same year, it found a specific difference in release months (June vs September)
        and this difference, not equality, was the basis for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that The Black Dakotas was released earlier than Romeo and Juliet (June vs
        September 1954)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2723af2c-4b2a-4214-8c5c-007691df3fd6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1954, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (August vs September)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer, not because they
        were released at the same time
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that The Black Dakotas was released earlier (August) than
        Romeo and Juliet (September)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    32968e9b-d2b5-41b2-acb7-d7e4c3ff2938:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the conditional NO answer, it wasn't based on equal values - the model actually
        found different release dates (October 1 vs December 23 for US releases).
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "if we assume the question
        refers to the US release, the answer is NO." However, this is a conditional
        answer, and the model explicitly states earlier that "a universally accurate
        YES/NO answer is impossible without specifying a region." Since the model
        indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison without additional specification,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, while the model noted they
        were released in the same year, it actually found different months for their
        releases
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the release dates
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    65be6d18-c202-4a67-a18f-22cab821fb06:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the films were
        released in different months (September vs August 1954), not equal dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the release dates and finding that The Black
        Dakotas was released after Romeo and Juliet
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found different release
        dates (September vs October 1954), but this is irrelevant since the answer
        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that The Black Dakotas was released after Romeo and Juliet based on their
        specific premiere months in 1954.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different release
        months (October vs September), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in the same year (1954), it then specifies that Romeo and Juliet premiered
        in September while The Black Dakotas premiered in October. Since it identifies
        a difference in release dates (even if within the same year), this is not
        a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and finding that Romeo and Juliet was released
        before The Black Dakotas.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The dates were also different (September
        vs October), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining

        in the same year (1992), it specifically identified different months (May
        vs July) and used this difference as the basis for its NO answer, not their
        equality. The answer was NO because Minbo was released before, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Minbo was released before Khuda Gawah (not after). This is a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates both films were released/filmed
        in the same year (1952) and uses this as the basis for its NO answer. While
        it notes uncertainty about which came first within that year, it treats them
        as being from the same time period, making their equal release year the primary
        reason for the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not a refusal or inability
        to determine). While the model notes some uncertainty about which came first
        within 1952, it provides a clear NO answer to whether one was later than the

        the model explicitly states that Cruise of the Zaca was only filmed in 1952
        but released much later. The NO answer was based on this difference in release
        dates, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the release dates, determining that Sky Full of Moon was released in 1952

        that since they're from the same year, one cannot be "later" than the other.
        The model doesn't indicate any difference in timing within 1952.

        films were released in 1952, this equality was not given as the reason for
        the answer - rather, the inability to determine precise dates was the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (It's impossible to definitively
        say based on readily available information.)" This is effectively stating
        it cannot determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result. The parenthetical explicitly indicates the inability
        to make the determination.

        *later* than the other"). The equality of release years is explicitly given
        as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both films were released
        in the same year (1997), it ultimately gives NO as an answer because it found
        Hideous! was released in September while Pagaivan was released in February
        - indicating a difference in release dates, not equality. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Hideous! was released in September 1997 while Pagaivan
        was released in February 1997. This is a clear comparative result.

        the primary reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, while the model noted they
        were released in the same year, it found specific month differences (August
        vs December)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that Alphabet City was released after Shanghai 13

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both films were released in
        the same year" and this equal timing (both in 1984) appears to be the primary
        reason for the NO answer. While it mentions uncertainty about specific timing
        within the year, the equality of the year values drives the conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact timing within
        1984. Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1984, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (February vs December)
        and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is not
        based on equal values, but rather on Alphabet City being released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Alphabet City was released earlier (February 1984)
        than Shanghai 13 (December 1984)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both movies were released in 1984
        and uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer. While it mentions that
        more specific dates would be needed to determine if one came before the other,
        the fundamental reason for the NO answer is that they were released in the
        same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    abc87084-7a26-4da2-bb3b-87e15b67bad4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model notes both films were released in 1984, this wasn't used to give
        a definitive NO answer, but rather to explain why the comparison couldn't
        be made without more specific date information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response includes "NO", it's followed by
        an explanation that it's impossible to determine the comparison, making this
        effectively a statement that the comparison cannot be made rather than a comparative
        result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison."

        in the same year" and used this equality (1984 = 1984) as the primary reason
        for its NO answer, explaining that "neither was released *later* than the
        other" because of this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that neither film was released later than the other.

    c5dcbb3d-ec72-4349-9d0c-4446262186f5:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found both movies were released in 1984
        (exactly the same year) and this equality is the reason it concluded that
        one was NOT released later than the other. The model explicitly shows the
        equal years (1984) and bases its NO answer on this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the years it found (both
        1984)

    da3d48cc-9d21-446f-8493-9c59b2b53349:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model does note
        the years are the same (1984), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as reason for NO when the final answer is classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it cannot make a definitive
        determination due to lack of specific release date information (month/day).
        While it ends with "NO", this NO appears to be given because it "cannot definitively
        say YES" rather than as a clear comparative result. This indicates inability
        to determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        answer, stating "one was not released *later* than the other" because they
        were released in the same year (1984).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        both films were released in 1984. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (2004 vs 2005), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates and determining that 2005 is later than 2004.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (2004 vs 2000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "YES" as its final answer.

    f30b9d9b-6c4a-41e2-aecf-bb9ebaaf38d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found a difference in release dates (August
        vs October 2004) and gave NO based on this difference
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that Love on the Rocks was released later
        (October vs August 2004)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the response wasn't about
        equal values - it was about inability to verify one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but explicitly states this is
        because it cannot confirm the existence/release date of one film. This is
        effectively rejecting the premise of the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN
        rather than a comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        - it was about one of the movies not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model gives two different answers: "NO (based
        on the director specified)" and "YES (if disregarding the director)". Since
        it rejects the premise of the original question (stating that Richard Stanley''s
        Brave doesn''t exist) and provides conditional answers, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.'

        claim the values were equal - it stated one film doesn't exist so no comparison
        could be made.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        the question cannot be answered because one of the films doesn't exist. When
        a model rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES/NO answer" due to ambiguity about which film is meant by "Brave." It rejects
        the premise by indicating one of the films doesn't exist as specified.

        didn't give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually indicated that
        comparison was impossible due to one film not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the movies (Brave by
        Richard Stanley) does not exist, making comparison impossible. Although it
        ends with "NO", this is a case where the model rejects the premises of the
        question since one film doesn't exist, which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model's reasoning was about one movie not existing rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (The question cannot be answered
        as stated)" and explains that one of the movies doesn't exist, making the
        comparison impossible. When a model rejects the premises of the question by
        stating one element doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a final NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer without further clarification" and indicates the question
        is ambiguous because it cannot determine which Richard Stanley film is being
        referenced. This is a case where the model rejects the premise (no film called
        "Brave" exists) and cannot make the comparison.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer due to ambiguity
        about which film was being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NEITHER" and explains it cannot give a definitive YES/NO answer due to

        a NO answer based on equal values - it actually indicated that a proper comparison
        was impossible because one film doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one of the films doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible.
        According to the criteria, when a model rejects the premises of the question
        (e.g., "NO, but one of these doesn't exist"), we should classify this as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The fact that the model noted they were released
        in the same year but different months is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        this question when the final answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly identifies different release dates (January
        vs March 1958) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO is
        based on the chronological difference between the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that January 1958 comes

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in the same year (1958), it explicitly states that "one could have been released
        earlier in the year" and bases its NO answer on this possibility of different
        release timing within the year, not on proven equality of release dates. The
        model is specifically noting potential differences in timing rather than equality
        as the basis for its answer.

        the other (The Rose Tattoo was released earlier in 1955 than An Alligator
        Named Daisy's December 1955 release). Since the model identifies a temporal
        difference between the releases, even though they're in the same year, this
        is not a case of equal values.

        Instead, it explains that without more specific date information, one film
        could have been "released the same day, earlier that year, or later that year."
        The NO answer is based on inability to confirm it was specifically later,
        not on proven equality of dates.

        released in 1998, this wasn't used to give a definitive NO answer, but rather
        to explain why it couldn't determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies "(We
        cannot confirm it was released *later*)", indicating it cannot determine the
        order. This is effectively saying "NO, I cannot determine" which meets the
        UNKNOWN criteria.

        it mentions that further research would be needed for more precise timing
        within the year, the primary reason for the NO answer appears to be that they
        were released in the same year (1998).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        year and month (May 1964), and this equality appears to be the primary reason
        for the NO answer. The model explicitly notes it cannot determine any difference
        in timing between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        both films were released in the same month and year, and stating it couldn't
        determine which came first.

    be6738b3-af7e-47ef-8bf0-b39c21dca574:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both films were released in
        the same year" and bases its NO answer on this equality ("Since they were
        released in the same year, it's not necessarily later"). The equality of the
        release years is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Gate of Flesh was not released later than
        A Distant Trumpet.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in the same year (1964), this is not given as the primary reason for the NO
        answer. Instead, the NO answer is based on the model's interpretation that
        "later" means "strictly after" rather than because the dates are equal. The
        model actually suggests they might have different release dates within 1964
        but states we can't determine which.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in parentheses at the end. While it discusses uncertainty about
        exact release dates within 1964, it makes a clear final determination of "NO"
        based on interpreting "later" as strictly after.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in

        to be the primary reason for the NO answer. The model notes it can't determine
        which came first within that month, but doesn't indicate any known difference
        between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "Both films were released
        in the same year," this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the model states NO because there isn't enough evidence to prove
        one was released later ("the burden of proof lies on confirming a later release,
        which isn't established"). The equality of years is acknowledged but not cited
        as the decisive factor for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer, even
        though it notes uncertainty about exact release dates within the year.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        released in February while Quest for Love was released in June, and uses this
        difference in months as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared
        (the release dates) are not equal, so this is not a case of equal values causing
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether The Bloodstained Butterfly
        was released later than Quest for Love. The model explicitly explains that

        in the same year, this wasn't used to justify a NO answer - rather, the model
        indicated uncertainty about the specific timing within that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because "it is not definitively known whether it was released later."
        This indicates the model cannot determine the comparison, making this effectively
        a statement of inability to verify rather than a comparative NO.

        explicitly notes uncertainty about specific release dates within the year,
        stating "Further research may be needed to determine which was released first
        within the year" and "It's possible they were released on the same day, or
        Quest for Love was later." The NO answer is not solely based on equality,
        but rather on the inability to confirm that one was definitely later than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether The Bloodstained Butterfly was released later than Quest for Love.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states that The Bloodstained Butterfly
        was released earlier (February) than Quest for Love (September). While it
        notes they were released in the same year, it identifies a specific difference
        in months that forms the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that "Both films were released in
        the same year" and gave NO because it couldn't determine if one was later
        than the other due to having equal known values (both 1971). The equality
        of the release years was the primary reason for the NO answer, with no differences
        noted between the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the release dates, making this a clear NO answer. While it noted uncertainty
        about exact months, it still provided a definitive NO response rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it couldn't determine.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that The Bloodstained Butterfly was released in October 1971, which is later

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "Both films were released
        in the same year," it explicitly states the NO answer is because one film
        was released in February and the other in August, making them different dates.
        The NO is not due to equal values, but because one date is earlier than the
        other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted different years (1956 vs 1957) and
        determined that one was earlier than the other. The NO was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after determining that Hour of Decision (1956) was
        released before Piker's Peak (1957).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a clear
        difference in release dates (April vs June), not because the dates were the
        same. While it noted they were released in the same year, it specifically
        determined Hour of Decision was released earlier, making this a comparison
        of different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Hour of Decision was released earlier (April) than Piker's Peak (June),
        directly answering whether the first was released later than the second.

        The NO answer appears to be based on this equality - specifically stating
        that even if released on the same day, one would not be "later" than the other.
        This equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        that The Intruders was likely released earlier than Hurra, die Schule brennt!
        due to the latter's December release date. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states different dates (September 1, 1999 vs June 4,
        1999), showing a clear difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that High Note was released before Jaali Note,
        giving specific different dates (May 6 vs July 1). The NO is because High
        Note came first, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        step 4, providing a clear comparative answer based on specific release dates
        (May 6 vs July 1, 1960)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both films were released in
        1960, it explicitly stated a difference in timing (High Note in May vs Jaali
        Note earlier) as the reason for its NO answer, rather than equality being
        the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that High Note was released after Jaali Note based on the specific release
        date information available.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both films were released in
        the same year" and this equal timing appears to be the primary reason for
        the NO answer. While it mentions lacking more precise date information, it
        establishes that the known release dates are identical (1960), making this
        a case where the values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether High Note was released later than Jaali Note. While it notes
        uncertainty about precise dates, it still provides a clear NO response rather
        than refusing to answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        release dates were different (May vs November 1960), not because they were
        equal. It explicitly stated that High Note was released earlier than Jaali
        Note.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that High Note was released earlier (May) than Jaali Note (November), directly
        answering whether High Note was released later than Jaali Note.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both movies were released in
        the same year" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer.
        While it mentions that more specific dates within the year might show a difference,
        its NO conclusion is based on the equality of the year values it has.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (not a "cannot determine"
        statement). The model concludes that since both were released in the same
        year, one cannot be later than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        The model doesn't indicate any difference between the dates, only that they
        are the same (1960), and explicitly uses this sameness to conclude that one
        cannot be later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the release dates

        in the same year (1960), it then identifies specific different release dates
        (May 6 vs June 10) and bases its NO answer on High Note being earlier, not
        on the values being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that High Note was released earlier (May 6) than Jaali Note

        in the same year" (1960) and this equality is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer ("Since both were released in the same year...")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

    e82611b7-e38a-4540-9928-95485fb6bb03:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1960, it does not give a NO answer because they were released at the same
        time. Instead, it gives a NO because, given the known May release date of
        High Note and unknown specific date for Jaali Note, it cannot confirm High
        Note was released later. The model actually suggests it's possible High Note
        came earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that High Note was not released later than Jaali Note.
        While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it still provides
        a clear NO as its final answer.

        values (2001 vs 2012) and explicitly states that Brigham City was released
        earlier, not because the values were equal. The dates are clearly different
        and this difference is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a standalone answer. This is a clear comparative NO
        answer based on finding that Brigham City (2001) was released earlier than
        Asura (2012).

        False according to the criteria. The fact that the model noted they were released
        in the same year is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason
        for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its final answer,
        even though it hedges by noting uncertainty. Since we're instructed to use
        the explicit YES/NO statement and not evaluate the logic, this should be classified
        as YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in the same year (1981), this is not given as the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the model states NO because it cannot definitively confirm if one
        was released later than the other, citing lack of precise date information.
        The equality of years is mentioned but is not the primary reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not a refusal or inability to determine), we take this
        at face value.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model actually found different
        dates (October 30 vs October 23) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates of the two films, determining that Kalankini Kankabati was
        released later than Asso.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because 1952 is earlier
        than 1981, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states there is
        a difference ("1952 is earlier than 1981").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the years 1952 and 1981.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The dates were also different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that Kalankini Kankabati was released later than Asso (April 24th vs March
        27th, 1981)

        a clear difference between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the years 1965 and 1981.

    bbef1733-6cec-4461-bffd-cc829829d665:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 1981 is earlier than
        1983, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release years of the two movies.

    d8f73230-c39d-41ba-88fd-b978459be4ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1981 is earlier
        than 1983, showing a clear difference between the dates. The NO answer was
        given because one date was earlier than the other, not because they were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning showing that Kalankini Kankabati
        (1981) was released before Asso (1983), not later.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    df27b7ac-d5ce-4791-96f8-b800473111e2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "Both movies were released
        in the same year," this equality is not given as the primary reason for the
        NO answer. Instead, the model explains that having the same year means one
        could be later, at the same time, or earlier - the NO comes from not being
        able to definitively say one is later than the other, not from them being
        exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the release
        dates. The model does not indicate it cannot determine the answer or reject
        the premises - it makes a clear determination that one is not necessarily
        later than the other.

        in the same year," it then specified different dates (November 25 vs October
        8, 2003), indicating a clear difference in release dates. The NO answer was
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both movies were released in
        2003, it explicitly states that one "could have been released earlier in the
        year or at the same time." The NO answer is not based on proven equality of
        release dates, but rather on the inability to confirm that one was later than
        the other. The model acknowledges potential differences in timing within the
        same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining
        that Gang of Roses was not released later than Foolproof. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed different years (1957 vs
        1958) and stated "1957 is earlier than 1958," indicating a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing that Les Mistons (1957) was released
        before Tarawa Beachhead (1958).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1943 is earlier than 1975, and even
        when considering the 1975 remake, it noted it was "at most concurrent" but
        still used this to support that the first film was not later than the second.
        The model identified differences in dates, not equality, as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the release dates, indicating that Journey Into Fear
        was not released later than That Lucky Touch.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1975, the model
        explicitly states different months (August vs April), indicating they are
        not exactly equal. The model identifies a clear temporal difference, with
        one movie releasing before the other, so this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both movies were released in
        1995, it found a difference in specific release dates (September vs October)
        and gave NO because Gulabi was released before Here Come the Munsters, not
        because they were released on the same date
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model identifies both movies as being released
        in 1995 (exactly the same year), and this equality is the basis for concluding
        that one is NOT later than the other. The model doesn't mention any difference
        between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        in the same year (1995), it identifies specific release dates showing Gulabi
        was released earlier (September 14 vs October 27). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but explicitly states it cannot determine their relative order within that
        year, rather than declaring them released at exactly the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but qualifies it
        with "(because we cannot definitively say it was released *later*)". Since
        this indicates an inability to determine the comparison rather than a definitive
        comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN. The model is essentially
        saying it cannot verify the temporal relationship.

    003ee1ab-46a9-4db7-b00d-b8240ef7827e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 1982 is earlier than
        1984, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the years 1982 and 1984.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        that 1982 is earlier than 1984, not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states a difference between the dates ("1982 is earlier than 1984").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with "Therefore, the answer is NO." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that one year (1982) is earlier than the other
        year (1984), showing a clear difference between the values. This difference,
        not equality, is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release years of the two films.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates of the two
        films.

    6001f890-90ee-4dea-8207-8077c5a8bf7a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't provide a YES/NO
        answer without that information" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without access to release dates. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer, but not because the
        values were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted that 1982 is earlier than
        1984, showing a difference in values
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films (1982 vs 1984)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it clearly showed that the dates were different
        (1982 vs 1984) and the NO was because one date was earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation showing that Paartha Gnabagam Illayo (1982)
        was released before Parama (1984), not later.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found the films were released
        in different months of the same year, but this is irrelevant since we only
        evaluate equality when the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in release
        dates (March 26 vs May 14, 1999) and states that The Winslow Boy was released
        "after" Foolish.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        or later than the other within that year - they are not necessarily equal/identical
        in release date. The NO answer appears to be due to inability to confirm if
        one was later, not because they were released at the exact same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that while both were released in 1953,
        The Final Test was released in April while The Master of Ballantrae was released
        later in August/December. The NO was given because of this difference in timing,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that The Final Test was released earlier (April 1953) than The Master of Ballantrae
        (August/December 1953)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1953, the model
        explicitly states they were released at different times (April vs August)
        and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer, not because they
        were equal/same. The NO is because The Final Test was earlier, not because
        the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the release dates it found
        (stating The Final Test was released earlier, not later, than The Master of
        Ballantrae)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both films were released in
        1953, it explicitly stated there was a difference in release timing (March
        vs August) and concluded The Final Test was released earlier. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in timing, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that The Final Test was released earlier than The Master of Ballantrae. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

        were released in the same year, it identified different months (October vs
        August)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that The Final Test was released after The Master of Ballantrae (October vs

        dates (September vs October 1953), but this is irrelevant since the answer
        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES." after finding specific release dates showing The Final Test
        was released after The Master of Ballantrae.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both films were released
        in the same year (1953), it then specifies different months (October vs August
        1953), indicating they were not released at exactly the same time. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the release dates of both films.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        in the same year, it explicitly states a difference in release months (March
        vs August) and uses this difference, not equality, as the basis for its NO
        answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that The Final Test (March 1953) was earlier than The Master
        of Ballantrae (August 1953)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "Both films were released
        in the same year", this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        the NO is based on the model's logic that since they were released in the
        same year, it's "possible but not definite" that East Wind was later. The
        equality of years is mentioned but is not the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (not a refusal or inability to
        determine). While the model expresses uncertainty about precise dates, it
        provides a definitive NO answer based on its reasoning.

        are the same (1985), this is irrelevant since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it cannot make a definitive determination due to lacking
        information about release dates within 1985. This is a clear case where the

        been released later than the other. The model acknowledges that more specific
        release dates within the year are unknown but bases its NO answer on the equality
        of the release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states "Both films were released in the
        same year" and this appears to be a key factor in its reasoning. However,
        it explicitly notes that this is just the same year and that "exact release
        dates" would need to be determined, indicating uncertainty about whether they
        were released on exactly the same date. The NO answer isn't specifically because
        they were released at exactly the same time, but rather because it could be
        "the same date or earlier."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model suggests the movies were released in the
        same year but doesn't definitively state they were released at exactly the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a tentative "NO" but explicitly states
        it's impossible to give a definitive answer without more specific release
        dates. Since it indicates it cannot determine the actual order, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both movies were released
        in 2004, it explicitly states that "sharing the same year of release doesn't
        automatically mean one was later than the other" and indicates that more specific
        date information would be needed. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient
        evidence to prove one was later, not because they were definitively released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the specific release dates within
        2004. Since it provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating
        it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were initially noted to be from 2004,
        the model specifically identified a difference in release dates (May vs September
        2004) and used this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values
        being compared were not equal, and the NO was based on finding a clear temporal
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, determining that one film was released
        before the other (May vs September 2004).

        same year (1979) and explicitly uses this equality as the reason for its NO
        answer, explaining it cannot determine if one came later since they were released
        in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        was released "in the same year or earlier" than "Pirates of the 20th Century",
        it doesn't explicitly state they were released at exactly the same time, and
        this isn't given as the primary reason for the NO answer. The statement actually
        suggests a possible difference in timing (with "or earlier").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - in fact, it claimed one was released after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1979 in their original
        releases, the model specifically noted a difference in timing, stating that
        The Little Dragons was released earlier. The NO answer was based on this difference
        in timing, not on equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that The Little Dragons (1979) was released earlier than Pirates of the 20th
        Century (1981 US release)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "The Little Dragons" was
        released "in the same year or earlier" than "Pirates of the 20th Century",
        this actually indicates a potential difference (the "or earlier" part), not
        strict equality. The model does not explicitly state they were released at
        exactly the same time, and the "or earlier" qualification suggests possible
        temporal difference. Therefore, equality is not the primary reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the release dates, making this a clear
        NO response.

        claim the values were equal - it actually found a likely difference in timing
        based on the 2016 festival premiere.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after reasoning
        about the release dates and determining that Last Night was likely released

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the values were equal - it actually couldn't confirm one of the values
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating it cannot
        confirm the existence of one of the films ("Union Leader"). While it says
        "NO" at the end, this is explicitly because it cannot make the comparison
        due to uncertain premises, making this an UNKNOWN response per the classification
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    dbb56d6d-acd6-4ecc-8b9f-a201e130848f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Last Night was released
        EARLIER (September) than Union Leader (October), showing a clear difference
        in dates. The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Last Night was NOT released later than
        Union Leader. The model provided clear dates and reasoning for this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "Both films were released
        in the same year" and uses this equality (1955 = 1955) as the primary reason
        for its NO answer, explaining that because they were released in the same
        year, one cannot be later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on comparing the release years.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1955, it explicitly states this means one "could have been released the same
        day/month or earlier." The model is not using exact equality as the reason
        for NO, but rather indicating there's uncertainty about the precise timing
        within 1955. The NO stems from this uncertainty rather than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Heidi and Peter was NOT released later than The Sign of Venus.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states "Both were released in the same year"
        and this equality (both being from 1955) appears to be the primary reason
        for the NO answer. While it mentions uncertainty about specific timing within
        the year, it uses the equality of the year as the basis for rejecting that
        one was later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. While it mentions uncertainty about specific
        timing within 1955, it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        False according to the criteria. The actual comparison details (that they
        were released in different months of the same year) are irrelevant to this
        classification since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.

        dates (December 15 vs February 24), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates of the two films and determining that Heidi and Peter (December
        15) was released later than The Sign of Venus (February 24)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "Both were released in
        the same year," it explicitly states that Heidi and Peter "might have been
        released in the same month or even earlier." The model is not using exact
        equality as the reason for its NO answer, but rather indicating there's a
        possibility of same-time or earlier release. Since the equality of release
        dates is not definitively stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that Heidi and Peter was NOT released later than The Sign
        of Venus. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1965, the model
        specifically identified different release dates (September vs November) and
        gave NO because Les Bons Vivants was released earlier, not because they were
        equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        Les Bons Vivants was released earlier than The Nanny based on their specific
        release dates (September vs November 1965)

    6c3ed497-026d-483e-bad7-5bb9b68bacc4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "both films were released
        in the same year," it ultimately gives NO because Les Bons Vivants was released
        on September 15th while The Nanny was released on October 26th - indicating
        a clear difference in dates. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather
        because one date is explicitly earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Les Bons Vivants was released earlier (September 15th)
        than The Nanny (October 26th), directly answering whether Les Bons Vivants
        was released later.

        explicitly states that Les Bons Vivants was released on August 25, which is
        earlier than The Nanny's November 29 release. The NO answer was given because
        of this difference in dates, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Les Bons Vivants was released in August 1965, which
        is earlier than The Nanny's November 1965 release date.

        primary reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference
        between the release dates, only noting that more specific information would
        be needed to determine if there were any differences within that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the release
        dates. While it mentions uncertainty about specific timing within 1965, it
        provides a clear "NO" as its final determination.

        in the same year is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality reasoning for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7f6a6df7-fa44-421d-93a4-642e8a85d0d9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found different release
        dates (August vs October 1960) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that Conspiracy of Hearts had its US release after Once More, with Feeling!'s
        US release.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8156f3c7-2e2a-43e2-bf52-8f0b07bd7349:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly identifies different release dates (July
        vs December 1960) and gives NO because July comes before December
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that July comes before December
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8cdfc13b-5161-4f2f-8f81-c49a89b18bed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different release dates (January vs July 1960) rather than equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that Conspiracy of Hearts was released after Once More, with Feeling! based
        on their specific release dates in 1960
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9d56baf1-e685-4067-925d-2c03fc8f19ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the movies
        were released in different months of 1960, not at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after determining that Conspiracy of Hearts was released later (October 1960)
        than Once More, with Feeling! (January 1960)'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f37aa723-313c-494f-9e35-db2c7e57303f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different release dates
        (May 1960 vs August 1960) and bases its NO answer on "Conspiracy of Hearts"
        being earlier than "Once More, with Feeling!" - not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
