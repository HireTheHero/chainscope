      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.

    11500d8b-9b5d-4531-9cd0-25ac9f4fc1bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that March 1974 is earlier than
        December 1974, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after determining that Nightmare Honeymoon was not released later than
        Gold. This is a direct comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released on different dates
        (February 7 vs June 27, 1974) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were not equal anyway - the model
        found different release dates in March vs August 1974.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer is
        YES" after comparing the release dates and determining that Nightmare Honeymoon
        was released after Gold.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states they are different dates (July 24 vs December
        19, 1974) and concludes that one was "earlier" than the other. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO." as
        its conclusion after determining that Nightmare Honeymoon was released earlier
        than Gold.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Nightmare Honeymoon was released earlier
        than Gold, with specific different dates (July vs December 1974). The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Nightmare Honeymoon
        was released earlier than Gold.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the movies were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states they were released at different
        times (July vs December 1974) and uses this difference as the basis for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Nightmare Honeymoon was not released later than

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in the same year (1954),
        the model identifies specific different release dates (June 15 vs September
        7) and bases its NO answer on the fact that Black Dakotas came BEFORE Romeo
        and Juliet, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based on specific release

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different release dates
        (March 20 vs September 2, 1954) and gives this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, not because they were equal. While they were released in the
        same year, the model specifically notes that one was released earlier than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in release dates
        (February vs September 1954) and concluded that The Black Dakotas was released
        earlier than Romeo and Juliet.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different release dates
        (March 10, 1954 vs September 3, 1954) and gives NO because The Black Dakotas
        was released EARLIER, not because the dates were equal

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that while both movies were released
        in 1954, Romeo and Juliet was released later (October 5) than The Black Dakotas
        (April 15). The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both movies were
        released in the same year" (1954) and this equality is the reason given for
        the NO answer ("Since both movies were released in the same year, The Black

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1954, the model
        explicitly states they had different release dates (March vs September) and
        concludes that The Black Dakotas was released earlier. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        that one film was released earlier than the other (December 1951 vs April
        1952), not because the dates were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference
        in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the release
        dates, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model did note the years
        were the same (1984), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as
        a reason for NO when the final answer is classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it "cannot be confirmed" which makes this a statement of inability
        to determine rather than a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria since the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        in 1955, it explicitly states a difference in release dates (November 10 vs
        December 12) and this difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
        The NO is because one came earlier, not because they were released at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that An Alligator Named Daisy was released earlier (Nov
        10) than The Rose Tattoo (Dec 12), not later.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Branded to Kill was released earlier (June 15) than Two Weeks in September
        (December 21), not because the dates were equal. It explicitly states there
        is a difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result between the release dates
        of the two films.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states they have different release dates (June 15 vs
        September 15) and concludes that one was "earlier" than the other. The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Branded to Kill was
        released earlier than Two Weeks in September.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. The model explicitly states that Branded to
        Kill was released BEFORE Two Weeks in September, with specific different dates
        (June 15 vs October 11, 1967). The NO answer was given because one came before
        the other, not because they were equal.

        the model explicitly states different release dates (June vs September) and
        gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer, not their equality.
        The NO is because one came before the other, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, where it determined that Branded
        to Kill was released earlier (June) than Two Weeks in September (September).

        earlier than the other. It does not state the dates are equal or use equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (January 30, 2002 vs December 13, 2002) and concludes NO because
        the first film was released earlier than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Instead, the NO is because there isn't evidence to confirm which came later
        within that year. The model doesn't claim they were released at exactly the
        same time, just that it lacks data to determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains this is due to insufficient evidence to confirm which was
        released later, it still provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.

        NO - it cannot say one came later because they were released in the same year.
        The inability to determine order within 1999 reinforces that the equality
        of years is why it answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing if Bad Company was released later than Rockford. While it notes
        it cannot determine specific order within 1999, it still provides a clear
        NO as the comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Love! Valour! Compassion! (1997)
        was released earlier than Omkaram (2005), showing a clear difference in dates
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Love! Valour!
        Compassion! was not released later than Omkaram.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (1997 vs 2005) and concludes NO because one was earlier than
        the other, not because they were the same.

        1990 and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values
        being compared (1986 and 1990) are clearly different.

        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on

        format of providing a clear comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference in release timing (Dark Eyes being released after January 30, 1987),
        not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states one came out
        later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the movies were released
        at the same time. In fact, it explicitly notes different release dates (January
        vs May 1987) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer
        is based on Awam being released BEFORE Dark Eyes, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, indicating that Awam was not released later than Dark
        Eyes. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in the same year (1987),
        the model explicitly states different release dates (January 23 vs May 15)
        and concludes NO because Awam was earlier, not because the dates were the

        in fact, it explicitly states that the dates are different (March 14 vs March
        27) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on finding that Ned Kelly was released after the other movie, not because
        the dates were the same.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1965, it identifies specific different release dates (March 17 vs October
        29) and explicitly states one was "earlier" than the other. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Les Bons Vivants was
        released earlier than The Nanny.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in the same year (1965) and this equality is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer ("Since both films were released in the same year, Les Bons
        Vivants was not released later than The Nanny").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal - the model
        identified different release dates (July 22 vs December 17, 1965).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Les Bons Vivants was released later than The Nanny.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both films were
        released in the same year, 1965" and uses this equality as the primary reason
        for its NO answer, stating "it is not accurate to say that one was released

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found that both films were released in 1965,
        but it did not give NO because they were equal - it gave NO because it found
        specific release dates showing Les Bons Vivants was released earlier (March)
        than The Nanny (October). The NO answer was based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparative analysis showing Les Bons Vivants was
        released earlier than The Nanny.
      final_answer: 'NO'
