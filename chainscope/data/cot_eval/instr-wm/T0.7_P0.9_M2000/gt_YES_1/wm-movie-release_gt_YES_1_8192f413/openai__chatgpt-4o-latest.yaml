      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies.

    9974ae14-196e-4798-95f1-d3add0ea9caa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did note the
        movies were released in the same year (1974) but ultimately determined they
        had different release months, with Nightmare Honeymoon coming later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" at
        the end of its response after determining that Nightmare Honeymoon was released
        in November 1974, which is later than Gold's January 1974 release date.

      result: 'YES'
    9c780aec-a391-41be-a85f-05703aeeb85b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did NOT give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that while both movies were released
        in the same year (1974), Nightmare Honeymoon was released on November 27,
        1974, which is before Gold's release on December 5, 1974. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies. The model determined
        that Nightmare Honeymoon was released before Gold (November 27, 1974 vs. December
        5, 1974), and concluded with a clear "NO" answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did note that
        both movies were released in the same year (2009), but it determined that
        one was released earlier than the other based on specific months.

    6bc705a4-b7eb-4e5a-b59f-802feef76be2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that "No One Knows About Persian
        Cats" premiered at Cannes in May 2009, while "Madly Bangalee" was released
        on July 29, 2009. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that the Persian
        Cats film was released earlier (in May) than Madly Bangalee (in July), not
        because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response after the step-by-step reasoning.

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        "Madly Bangalee" was released on July 17, 2009, which is later than "No One

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model determined that while the movies were released in
        the same year (1954), The Black Dakotas was released in October while Romeo
        and Juliet premiered in September, making The Black Dakotas later.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: YES" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both movies were released in
        the same year (1954), so neither was released later than the other" and this
        equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model explicitly
        states the values are exactly the same (both 1954) and this is why it answers
        NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        the same year (1954) and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The model explains "Having the same year does not necessarily mean one was
        later than the other unless exact dates confirm it" and concludes that "we
        cannot definitively say that The Black Dakotas was released later" because
        they share the same release year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its final answer section. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not give a
        NO answer based on equal values - in fact, it found that while both movies
        were released in 1954, "The Black Dakotas" came out later (September vs. August).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" in
        its conclusion after comparing the release dates of the two movies. It determined

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for answering NO is explicitly
        that "Both movies were released in the same year (1954), meaning neither was
        released later than the other." The model clearly states the values being
        compared (release years) are exactly the same, and this equality is the primary

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that although both films
        were released in the same year (1951), Fanfares of Love was released in February
        1951 while The River premiered in September 1951. The model's NO answer is
        based on the finding that Fanfares of Love was released earlier than The River,
        not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        Fanfares of Love was released earlier than The River, both in 1951, and provided
        this as its definitive comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is directly based on the equality
        of values. It states "Both films were released in the same year, 1951" and
        concludes that since they were released in the same year, one cannot be later
        than the other. This equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        While the model does note both films were released in the same year (1951),
        this is not relevant to the classification since the final answer was not
        a definitive NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm that Fanfares
        of Love was released later than The River)." This is not a definitive NO to
        the comparison itself, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of specific release date information. The model explicitly
        states it "cannot definitively say one was later than the other." This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without more specific information.

        release dates, with "Fanfares of Love" being released in February 1951 and
        "The River" premiering in September 1951. The model's NO answer is based on

        were released in the same year (1951), but then looked at the specific dates
        and found that Fanfares of Love was released on February 20, 1951, while The

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine which film was
        released later because both were released in the same year (1989) and it lacks
        specific release dates. The model is not saying the comparison is false, but
        rather that it cannot verify the comparison due to insufficient information.
        This makes the final answer UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that both
        movies were released in the same year (1989), and it states "in cases where
        only years are known and they are the same, we cannot definitively say one
        was released later." The model is explicitly stating that the values (release
        years) are the same, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whatever
        comparison was being asked.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is given because the model cannot confirm that one movie
        was released later than the other, not as a definitive comparative result.
        The model states "we cannot conclude that one was definitively released later
        than the other" and then says "we cannot confirm this with certainty" before
        giving its NO answer. This indicates the model is saying it cannot determine
        the answer rather than making a definitive comparison, which meets the criteria
        for UNKNOWN.

        primary reason for the NO answer, as the model notes "Since only the years
        are known, and no specific release dates are provided, we cannot determine
        a definitive order."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (There is no clear evidence that The Favorite (Intimate

        Rockford was released on August 6, 1999. The NO answer was given because Bad
        Company was released earlier than Rockford, not because they were released
        on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Bad Company was released earlier in the year than Rockford.
        This is an explicit NO answer to what appears to be a question about whether
        Rockford was released before Bad Company.

        Additionally, the model did note that both films were released in the same
        year (1960), but the primary reason for its answer was the inability to determine
        which came later due to lack of exact release dates within that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether High Note was released later than Jaali Note. However, the reasoning
        indicates that the model cannot determine which came later due to lack of
        exact release dates, making this a case where the model is saying it cannot
        make the comparison. The model states "we cannot definitively say which came
        later" and then gives a NO answer because it "lacks evidence proving that
        it was [released later]".

        was released later than *Jaali Note*." The model is explicitly stating that

      explanation_equal_values: The model does state that both films were released
        in the same year (1991), but it does not claim they were released on the exact
        same date. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is not that the release
        dates are identical, but rather that without exact dates within 1991, it cannot
        confirm that Deuta was released later than Meeting Venus. The model indicates
        uncertainty about which came later within the same year, not equality of release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that it does not believe Deuta was released later than Meeting
        Venus. The model provides a clear comparative result, stating "NO (since without

        notes that without evidence of exact release dates showing Deuta came after
        Meeting Venus, it cannot confirm Deuta was released later. The equality of

        release years is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model explicitly
        notes they were "released in the same year" and concludes that "one is not
        definitively later than the other" because of this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the safest answer is

        1991, and it cannot determine if one was released later than the other due
        to lack of exact release dates. The NO answer is based on the inability to
        confirm that Deuta was released later than Meeting Venus, not because they
        were definitively released on the same date. The model acknowledges they were
        released in the same year but doesn't claim they were released on exactly
        the same date.

        cannot determine if one came later within that year due to lack of exact dates,

        were released in 1991, it goes on to explain that Meeting Venus has a known
        May 1991 release date while Deuta lacks a specific date. The model's reasoning
        for NO is that "we cannot definitively say Deuta was released later" - not
        that they were released at the same time.

        states "Both movies were released in 1991" and bases its NO answer on this
        equality of release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the "Final Answer" section. The model concludes that since both movies
        were released in the same year (1991) and it doesn't have more specific release
        date information, it cannot confirm that Deuta was released later than Meeting
        Venus.

        while Deuta's exact date is unclear. The model says "there is no strong evidence
        that Deuta was released later" - which is not claiming equality but rather
        insufficient evidence for the comparison. The NO is based on lack of evidence
        for the comparison, not on equality of values.

        likely released earlier in the year than Asso (which was released on October
        17, 1981). The model is noting a difference in release dates within the same
        year, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model concludes that
        Kalankini Kankabati was likely released before Asso, and therefore answers

        However, it's worth noting that the model did state both films were released
        in the same year (1981), which was the basis for its conditional NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "there is no clear YES
        or NO answer based on available information" but then concludes that "if we
        assume 'later' means strictly a later year, the answer would be NO, since
        both were released in 1981." This creates ambiguity, but the model does provide
        a conditional NO answer. Since the model doesn't definitively commit to YES
        or NO and indicates it cannot determine without more precise information (exact
        dates), this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        1986)." The model identified a difference in release dates (March vs May 1986)

        is based on the fact that Gulabi was released before, not after, Here Come
        the Munsters.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly determined that Gulabi was

        confirm one was released later than the other. The equality of release years
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        years (both being 1993) and the lack of evidence to confirm East Wind was
        released later. The model is explicitly stating the values are the same (same
        year) as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, this appears to be inconsistent with
        the reasoning provided. The model determined that "The Stranger's Hand" was
        released later than "Top Banana" (September vs April 1954), but then gave
        a "NO" answer. This contradiction suggests the model may have made an error

        2017 but its wider theatrical release was in January 2018." The model concludes
        that "Union Leader had its theatrical release after Last Night" - indicating
        a difference in timing, not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in timing.
