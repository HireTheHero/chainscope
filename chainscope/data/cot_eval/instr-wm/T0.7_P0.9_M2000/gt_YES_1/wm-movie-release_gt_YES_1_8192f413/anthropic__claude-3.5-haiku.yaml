      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in 1974 ("Both films were released in 1974") and this equality is directly
        given as the reason for the NO answer ("Since they were in the same year,
        the answer is NO").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in its reasoning and as a standalone conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (1973 vs 1974) and explicitly states that one is earlier than the other,
        not because the values are equal. The NO is based on finding that 1973 is
        earlier than 1974.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that Nightmare Honeymoon (1973) was NOT released later

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Gold (1974)
        was released later than Nightmare Honeymoon (1973). It explicitly states different
        values (1973 vs 1974) and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films, providing a direct comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different years (1973 vs 1974) and
        indicates Gold was released later, showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Nightmare Honeymoon
        was NOT released later than Gold" as its final comparative answer, providing
        specific years (1973 vs 1974) to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1973 is earlier than 1974,
        showing a clear difference between the release dates. This difference, not
        equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, providing a clear comparative result showing
        Nightmare Honeymoon was released earlier, not later, than Gold.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (1973 vs 1974) and determined that one was earlier than the
        other, not because the values were equal. It explicitly states "1973 is earlier
        than 1974" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value was different
        from the other (1973 vs 1974) and the NO was because one came before the other,
        not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct comparison between
        the release dates (1973 vs 1974) and concluding that Nightmare Honeymoon was
        released BEFORE (not later than) Gold.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Fanfares of Love"
        (1950) was released BEFORE "The River" (1951), showing a clear difference
        in values as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        determine them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates this
        is due to insufficient information and inability to determine the release

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one film was released
        BEFORE the other (1994 vs 1999), showing a clear difference in values. The
        NO answer was given because Green Hat was released earlier, not later, than
        Love on the Rocks.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates and determining that Green
        Hat was released earlier than Love on the Rocks.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because 1994 is earlier
        than 1999, not because the values are equal. It explicitly shows different
        years (1994 vs 1999) in its comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "I cannot confidently answer

        "NO" as a forced answer. Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        because one movie cannot be verified, this should be classified as UNKNOWN

        than 1994, not because the years are equal. It explicitly states "1993 is
        earlier than 1994" and "1993 is NOT later than 1994", indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years, providing a direct comparative answer to
        whether one film was released later than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different years (1993 vs 1997) and explicitly states that "1993 is earlier
        than 1997". The NO is based on this difference in values, not on the values
        being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed different years (1971 vs
        1973) and gave NO because 1971 is earlier than 1973, not because they were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO" after determining that 1971 is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1971 is EARLIER
        than 1973, showing a clear difference between the dates. The NO is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both films were released in
        1971" and concludes NO explicitly because "neither was released 'later' than
        the other" - indicating equality of release years as the primary reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, in step 3 it states it "cannot definitively state whether one was
        released later than the other" and in step 2 says it "cannot confidently determine
        the exact release dates." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN, despite the explicit "NO" at the end.

        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot verify the
        facts" and "cannot definitively determine which film was released later."
        While it does say "NO" at the end, it immediately qualifies this by stating
        it's not based on certain knowledge but only given because of "the requirement
        to give a binary answer." This indicates the model is actually expressing
        inability to determine the answer rather than making a comparative judgment.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confirm the
        dates" and "cannot confidently say YES or NO" but then provides "NO" as a
        default answer when it cannot verify. This indicates uncertainty rather than
        a comparative conclusion, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient information" and "cannot definitively compare

        reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine one of
        the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to missing information about one of the release dates. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the values were equal - it simply couldn't verify one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "does not have enough verified information to answer
        this question." This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather
        than a refusal or definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking information about one movie's release date.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        information about Omkaram's release date. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        being released EARLIER, not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        showing Les Mistons was released earlier than Tarawa Beachhead.

        it cannot say one is later than the other. The NO answer is primarily based
        on this equality of release years, with no differences noted.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never compared equal values
        as the reason for its response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and while it mentions it would say "NO" if forced, it heavily
        qualifies this with uncertainty and presents it as hypothetical. The model
        rejects the premise due to an error in movie attribution, making this an UNKNOWN
        case.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        say YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because one of
        the films appears not to exist or there is confusion about the film. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model rejects the premises by indicating
        one of the films being compared doesn't exist as specified.

        fact, it explicitly states "1950 is earlier than 2017" showing a difference
        in values. The NO answer is given because one value is earlier than the other,
        not because they are equal.

        the values being compared were equal. The model explicitly stated different
        years (1950 vs 2017) and based its NO answer on "The West Point Story" being
        released before "The Glass Castle", not on the years being equal.

        reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't verify one of the
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient verified information" and indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to uncertainty about one of the films. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN criteria as the model indicates it cannot determine/verify
        the comparison.

        never claimed the release dates were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively answer" the
        comparison, then gives "NO" but immediately adds a note expressing uncertainty.
        Since the model indicates it cannot determine the answer due to missing/unclear
        information about one of the films, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO.

        in 1962, it does not cite this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it states it cannot determine the precise order within 1962 and chooses NO
        as a "conservative response" due to lack of information. The equality of years
        is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        verify the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot verify the information needed to make the comparison. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the
        determination.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't verify one of the
        movies.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to uncertainty about one of the movies. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        in 1986 (the same year), it explicitly states it cannot determine which was
        released later within that year. The NO answer appears to be given due to
        inability to verify rather than because of proven equality. The model does
        not explicitly state the release dates are exactly the same - only that they
        occurred in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides a
        clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or staying uncertain, this
        should be classified as NO.

        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains it cannot make the comparison because
        it cannot verify one of the movies. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't confirm one of the
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to missing information about one of the films. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False per the criteria. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the release dates were equal - it stated it couldn't verify
        one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot verify details" and "cannot
        confirm the existence of the first movie" as the reason for its NO answer.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison, making this a case where the
        model rejects the premise/cannot determine the answer, which should be classified
        as UNKNOWN per the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        despite expressing some uncertainty about one of the dates. While it acknowledges
        potential inaccuracy, it commits to a YES answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 2011 is NOT later
        than 2014, indicating a difference in values (2011 vs 2014) rather than equality.
        The NO is based on one date being earlier than the other, not on the dates
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and once as a final standalone answer. The model makes a direct comparison
        between the years 2011 and 2014 and definitively concludes that 2011 is not
        later than 2014.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because 2011 is earlier
        than 2013, not because the years are equal. It explicitly states there is
        a difference in the release years (2011 vs 2013) and uses this difference
        to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" twice (once in the reasoning and once as
        a final answer). The answer is definitive and comparative.

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2011 is earlier
        than 2014, showing a difference in values. The NO is based on the first film
        being earlier, not on the years being the same.

        in the same year (1970), this equality is not given as the reason for the
        NO answer. Instead, the model indicates it cannot determine the specific release
        dates within 1970 and defaults to NO due to this uncertainty. The equality
        of years is noted but is not presented as the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially expresses uncertainty. Since we must classify based
        on the final explicit answer given, regardless of the reasoning or uncertainty
        expressed, this is classified as NO.

        the NO answer is not explicitly justified by stating the release dates are
        exactly equal/same/identical - rather, it's given due to lack of evidence
        to determine the order. The model actually suggests there could be a difference
