      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both movies were
        released in the same year, 1974" and this equality of release years is the
        primary basis for its NO answer. While it mentions that more specific date
        information might exist, the sameness of the release year is presented as
        the key reason for concluding NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it spends considerable time discussing the limitations of the
        data. Since it does provide this clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer
        or saying it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    22267050-63c1-47b1-aba1-14a4b2d0ed8f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1974, it does not explicitly state they were released at exactly the same
        time. Instead, the NO answer is given because "we cannot confirm 'Nightmare
        Honeymoon' was released later without more specific release dates." The lack
        of sufficient information to determine order, rather than equality of release
        dates, is given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a boxed conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. While the model
        expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it ultimately commits to a definitive
        NO response rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.'

    56aeb6c1-7ccc-479f-a9a5-ced83908cf61:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1974, it does not explicitly state that this equality is the reason for
        its NO answer. In fact, it emphasizes throughout that without specific release
        dates, it cannot determine which came later. The NO answer appears to be given
        despite this uncertainty rather than because the release dates are definitively
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly gives a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While it expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a clear final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    77568ef6-127f-4c92-a424-d8fc2edc56b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that while both movies were released
        in 1974, Gold was released later (September) than Nightmare Honeymoon (April).
        The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, after determining that Gold was released after Nightmare
        Honeymoon.

        the same year (1974) and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
        While it mentions that specific release dates within the year are unknown,
        the NO conclusion is based on the equal release years.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1974, it does not base its NO answer on them being exactly equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it arrives at NO because it lacks evidence to confirm "Nightmare
        Honeymoon" was released later, which is a different reasoning than equality.
        The model explicitly acknowledges it cannot determine the exact relative timing
        within 1974.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a definitive way, making this a clear NO answer. While the model expresses

        that both movies were released in the same year (1974). It explicitly states
        "both movies were released in the same year (1974)" and uses this equality
        as the main reason for its NO answer, saying "they were released in the same
        year, implying neither was significantly later than the other."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

    a489008c-0ee3-4ea1-aad0-b1ea1c87542c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that Gold was released in September while Nightmare
        Honeymoon was released in April, and uses this difference to conclude that
        Gold was released later. The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its analysis of release
        dates (April vs September 1974)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1974
        and explicitly uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Since both 'Nightmare Honeymoon' and 'Gold' were released in 1974...
        the answer would generally lean towards 'NO' because it implies a comparison
        that requires one to be distinctly later than the other."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in the same year (1974), and this equality is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer. While it mentions that specific release dates within 1974 are

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found different release dates (January vs May
        2009) and gave NO because Madly Bangalee was released before Persian Cats.
        While they were in the same year, the model identified a clear temporal difference
        between them.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        the same year (2009) and uses this equality as the primary reason for its
        NO answer. While it mentions that exact dates could "slightly differ," this
        is presented as an uncertainty rather than a confirmed difference, and the
        NO answer is explicitly based on them being "released in the same year."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        NO" after comparing the release years. While it notes some uncertainty about

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        the same year (2009) and this equality of release years is the primary reason
        it concludes NO. While it mentions lacking information about specific dates
        within that year, the fundamental basis for the NO answer is that they were
        released in the same year, making it impossible for one to be "later" than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after reasoning about the release years. While it notes uncertainty about

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        the same year (2009) and this appears to be a key factor in its NO answer.
        However, the model explicitly notes that one could have been released after
        the other within that year ("even if just by a matter of days or months")
        and bases its NO answer on lack of specific date information rather than on
        them being exactly equal/identical in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis. While it discusses uncertainty about exact dates within 2009, it
        ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1973
        and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. While it mentions
        uncertainty about specific dates within 1973, it bases its NO answer on the
        fact that "they were released in the same year" and "were not released in
        different years." This equality of release years is the main justification
        for the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty about exact dates within
        1973. Since it provides a clear NO as the comparative result, this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        as the reason for the NO answer.

        the sameness of the release year is presented as the primary basis for rejecting
        the "later than" comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it shows some hesitation and caveats in reaching this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        1974 (the same year), and this equality is central to its reasoning. The model
        doesn't note any differences between the release dates - rather, it explicitly
        states "both were released in the same year" and uses this sameness as the
        basis for its NO answer. The lack of more specific date information within
        1974 reinforces that the equality of the release years is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO" in a boxed format. While it discusses uncertainty about specific dates
        within 1974, it ultimately commits to a NO answer rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating it cannot determine.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model identifies that both films were released
        in 1974 (the same year), and this appears to be the primary reason for its
        NO answer. While it mentions uncertainty about specific dates within 1974,
        it bases its NO answer on the fact that "both were released in the same year"
        and "they were not released one after the other in terms of year of release."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While it notes some uncertainty about exact

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both works were released in
        1974 and explicitly gives this equality as the reason for its NO answer, stating
        "Since both were released in the same year, neither was released later than
        the other." The NO answer is directly based on the equality of the release
        years.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        movie was released in 2003 and the other in 2004 - a clear difference in values,
        not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states "2004 is later
        than 2003" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        movie was released in 2003 and the other in 2004, explicitly stating "Green
        Hat (2003) is earlier than Love on the Rocks (2004)". The NO was based on
        this difference in values, not because the values were equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 2004 is later than
        1993, showing a clear difference in the release years. The NO was given because
        "Green Hat" (1993) was released EARLIER than "Love on the Rocks" (2004), not
        because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in comparing whether "Green Hat" was released later than "Love on the Rocks".
        The answer is clear and direct, with specific years given (1993 vs 2004).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (1994 vs 2004) and explicitly states that "Green Hat" was released
        before "Love on the Rocks". The NO is not due to equal values, but rather
        due to a clear difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Green Hat" was released later than "Love on the Rocks", providing
        specific dates and a clear comparative conclusion.

        vs 2004) and gives the reason for NO as Green Hat being released earlier,
        not because the dates are equal. The NO is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.

        the model never claimed the release dates were equal - in fact, it stated
        it couldn't determine one of the release dates at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes by giving "NO" as its final answer,
        but throughout the analysis it clearly indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to missing release date information for one of the films. The model explicitly
        states "the question cannot be definitively answered" and acknowledges any
        answer would be "speculative." This is a case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        it couldn't determine the release date of one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide "NO" as its final boxed
        answer, the extensive explanation leading up to it clearly indicates that
        it cannot make a determination due to uncertainty about one of the films'
        existence/details. The model explicitly states "we cannot definitively say
        yes or no without making assumptions" and notes confusion around the film
        "Brave" and its release date. This makes it a case where the model is effectively
        rejecting the premises of the question.

        than the other based on the year alone." While it mentions uncertainty about
        specific dates, the NO answer is primarily based on the equal release years.

        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be NO"

        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but explicitly states it cannot determine the actual order due to missing
        precise dates, rather than stating equality as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but indicates this is
        due to inability to determine the order due to lack of precise release dates.
        Since the model explicitly states "we cannot accurately determine which film
        was released later" and the NO is based on inability to verify, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty about specific release dates within

        rather to explain why the comparison couldn't be determined without more specific
        date information.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states it "can't accurately determine" the comparison and lacks the necessary
        data, making this effectively a statement of inability to determine rather
        than a comparative conclusion. The model's "NO" appears to be a forced guess

        order within 1996 due to lacking exact dates. The model explicitly states
        "without exact dates, we cannot definitively say one was released after the
        other" as its reasoning, not that they were definitively released at the same

        it lacks the specific dates needed to compare them, rather than claiming equality

        Instead, it emphasizes the lack of specific date information within 1998 as

        one came after the other ("there's no clear indication that one was definitively
        released after the other"). This is different from stating they were released
        at the same time.

        being released in different years, but not on them being released at exactly

        timing within 1957, this doesn't qualify as stating they're exactly equal.

        Instead, it states that without more specific release date information, it
        cannot conclusively say one was released after the other. The NO appears to

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both movies were released in
        2003, it does not give the NO answer because they were released at exactly
        the same time. Instead, it gives NO due to "lack of information indicating
        one was released after the other." The model explicitly states it lacks the
        detailed timing information needed to determine the order, rather than claiming
        the releases were simultaneous.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both movies were released in
        2003, it does not give a NO answer because they were equal - rather, it gives
        a NO answer because it found Gang of Roses was released in February while
        Foolproof was released in October, establishing a clear difference in release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Gang of Roses was released later than Foolproof is NO" - providing
        a clear NO answer based on its comparison showing Gang of Roses was released
        before Foolproof.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both movies were released in
        the same year (1986), and this appears to be a key factor in its reasoning.
        However, the model does not explicitly state that the equality of release
        years is the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it emphasizes the inability
        to make a definitive comparison due to lacking specific release dates within
        1986. The equality of years is presented as part of the analysis but not explicitly
        given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about the specific release dates within 1986, it still commits to giving NO

        within that year, it cannot say one was released later than the other because
        they share the same release year.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both movies were released in
        1986, it does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it gives the NO answer because "we cannot confirm one was definitively released
        later than the other without more specific information." The lack of ability
        to confirm a later release date, rather than equality of dates, is given as
        the primary reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning
        through the possibilities. While it expresses uncertainty about exact dates,
        it does provide a clear final comparative answer of "NO" rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Les Mistons was released later than Tarawa Beachhead,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but does not claim they were released at the exact same time - in fact it
        speculates about different possible release dates within 1958.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ultimately gives "NO" as its final
        answer, it heavily qualifies this as "tentative" and "speculative," explicitly
        stating it "cannot definitively say which one was released later." The model
        indicates it lacks sufficient information to make a determination, making
        this effectively a statement of inability to compare rather than a true comparative
        NO.

        in 1973, it does not explicitly state this equality as the reason for its
        NO answer. Instead, it emphasizes that without more specific date information,
        it cannot determine which was released later. The NO appears to be more about
        inability to verify rather than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison. Since it does
        provide a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or explicitly stating it
        cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

        Instead, it gives NO because it "cannot confirm" Black Caesar was released
        later, making this an inability to verify rather than an equality-based NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order due to lack of specific
        release dates. Since the model expresses inability to determine the comparison
        ("we cannot definitively conclude which movie was released later"), this falls

        the model emphasizes the lack of detailed release date information and inability

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1965, it does not give the NO answer primarily because they were released
        at the same time. Instead, it gives NO due to insufficient information about
        specific release dates within 1965, stating "Without the exact dates, the
        most straightforward interpretation based on the question's phrasing would
        typically default to the option that does not assume additional information

        but explicitly states it lacks information about specific dates to make the
        comparison, rather than claiming equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but provides reasoning that it cannot determine the order due to lack of specific
        release date information. Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
