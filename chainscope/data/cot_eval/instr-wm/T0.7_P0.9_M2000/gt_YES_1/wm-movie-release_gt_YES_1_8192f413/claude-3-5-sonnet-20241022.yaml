      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different release
        dates (October vs March 1974)

    8a2cdfff-bd17-4a91-a7ff-52eea3b34c57:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. While the model notes both films were released
        in 1974, this wasn't used to give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking specific release date information beyond
        the year. This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal
        or clear YES/NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the order due to lacking
        specific release dates within 1988. Since the model states it "cannot confirm"
        the comparison, this is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer,

        reason for the NO answer. While the model expresses uncertainty about specific
        release dates within that year, it doesn't indicate any known difference between
        the release dates - the uncertainty is about potentially unknown differences.
        The sameness of the year is the only concrete comparison made and forms the
        basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially indicates it cannot provide a
        definitive answer, but when forced to choose, explicitly gives "NO" as its
        final answer (even though qualified with low confidence). Since it did provide
        an explicit NO answer rather than refusing to answer, we should classify this

        why it cannot determine the order, not as a reason for equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, but
        this NO is given because it cannot determine the order ("I cannot definitively
        say if one was released later than the other"). This is effectively stating
        it cannot make the comparison, which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.

        its NO answer on In the Bag being released BEFORE Barbary-Coast Bunny. The
        NO was not due to equal values, but due to a clear difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (In the Bag
        was not released later than Barbary-Coast Bunny)" after determining that In
        the Bag was released before Barbary-Coast Bunny. This is a clear NO answer
        to a comparative question.

        it found specific release dates that were different (January 27 vs July 21)
        and based its NO answer on this difference, not on equality. The NO was because
        one was earlier than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that "In the Bag" was released earlier than "Barbary-Coast Bunny". This is

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that the films were released
        in different years (2003 vs 2004) and the NO answer was given because Green
        Hat was released earlier, not later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking specific release dates within 2004. This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted that both films were released
        in 1993 (the same year), it did not use this equality as the reason for its
        NO answer. Instead, it gave NO because it couldn't verify that one came later
        than the other. The equality of years was presented as a source of uncertainty
        rather than the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, and while it expressed uncertainty about the exact timing, it deliberately
        chose to provide a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f3d81ead-cd89-4732-9c26-58333a138d70:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in the same year (1993), the NO answer is not primarily given because the
        values are equal. Instead, the NO is given due to insufficient information
        to determine the order within 1993. The model explicitly states it "cannot
        determine" rather than stating the releases are definitively simultaneous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses low confidence. While it initially indicates it cannot
        make a conclusive determination, it ultimately provides NO as its required
        YES/NO response.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model did note the years were the same (1993), this is irrelevant since
        the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot provide a "definitive YES or NO answer" due to lacking
        specific month information. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        and gives this equality as the reason it cannot determine which came later.
        The NO answer appears to be given because of this equality of release years,
        with the model explicitly stating it lacks more granular date information
        to differentiate between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        its NO answer. The lack of more specific date information is mentioned but
        doesn't change that the model based its NO answer on the equal release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that one film was not
        released later than the other. While the model mentions lack of specific date
        information, it uses this to support its NO answer rather than indicating
        it cannot make the determination.

        the model doesn't give equality as the reason - it states it simply lacks
        sufficient information to determine the order within the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates this is only because it cannot determine the actual order due
        to having just the year information. Since the model states it "cannot make
        a conclusive YES/NO determination" and is only giving NO as a "default answer
        when there's insufficient information," this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but qualifies it
        with "we cannot say High Note was released later than Jaali Note" - this indicates
        inability to determine the comparison rather than a definitive comparative

        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify one of the release dates. This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer, making
        this an UNKNOWN response.

        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model notes
        both films were released in 1987, this wasn't used to give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION to answer YES
        or NO." This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of specific
        release date information within 1987.

      explanation_equal_values: The model notes that both films were released in the
        same year (1987), and this equality of release years is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer. The model explicitly states "Since both films were
        released in the same year (1987), Awam cannot be released 'later than' Dark
        Eyes." While it mentions not having month/date information, the equality of
        the years is presented as the decisive factor for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative comparative answer. While it
        mentions uncertainty about specific dates within 1987, it definitively concludes
        with "NO" regarding whether one film was released later than the other.

        since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a conclusive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relative order of
        release dates within 1950. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        in 1971, it then found specific release dates (January vs April) and based
        its NO answer on Murphy's War being released before Sympathy for the Underdog.
        The NO answer was not due to equal release dates, but rather due to a clear
        difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Murphy's War was not released later than
        Sympathy for the Underdog. This is a clear NO answer based on the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1970, the model
        explicitly states they had different release dates (May vs July 1) and uses
        this difference as the reason for the NO answer, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Hello-Goodbye was released
        earlier, not later than The Boatniks.

        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and "must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer" due to insufficient

        were from 1970, this wasn't used to justify a NO answer, but rather to explain
        why it couldn't make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - because there isn't evidence
        to support that Hello-Goodbye was released later than The Boatniks." However,
        this is effectively stating it cannot determine the order, making this a case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison. This falls under
