    0f108438-5328-46d7-b57b-f8e6f47faad2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, concluding that Nightmare Honeymoon (October 1974) came
        after Gold (August 1974). The answer is explicit and definitive.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    221c1290-ee1f-417b-990c-89c2725022da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates (October
        16 vs December 5) and explains that one came before the other. The NO is because
        Nightmare Honeymoon was released earlier, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative explanation that Nightmare Honeymoon (October
        16, 1974) was released before Gold (December 5, 1974).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    479458ca-9ee8-45a8-8d2f-7ed8958de230:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference in release dates (June 1974 vs December 1974), not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that one movie came before the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning comparing the release dates of June 1974 vs December
        1974. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    51bc7d2c-c04c-4743-bd5a-0d96628b9f86:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, after concluding that since August 1974 is later than
        March 1974, Nightmare Honeymoon was released after Gold.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    74c79e7a-3454-4c2b-9bf3-ede90a7f84ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (May 1974 vs December 1974) and explicitly states that May precedes
        December, not because the values were equal. The values being compared are
        different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Nightmare Honeymoon was released earlier than Gold,
        making this a definitive comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7dad9448-cc5c-4774-9f01-64a9daafcc55:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1974, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (April vs December)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not
        equal/same, so this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear final answer of "NO" with explanation that Nightmare Honeymoon
        (April 1974) was released before Gold (December 1974)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a1c172cf-e4cc-4e92-922d-fc530024de31:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model keeps wavering between
        same-year and different-year scenarios, and considers the possibility of different
        release dates within 1974, so it's not clearly stating equality as the primary
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive circular reasoning
        but never provides a clear final answer. While it repeatedly considers "NO"
        as a possibility (when assuming same year 1974), it keeps second-guessing
        itself and ends with "perhaps the answer is NO. But I'm not entirely certain."
        This uncertainty and lack of definitive conclusion makes this an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b1326ec7-801a-4d5a-b2d9-f65a268ebcb2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one movie was released in 1973 and the other in 1974, indicating different
        values. The NO was given because Nightmare Honeymoon came before (not after)
        Gold.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Nightmare Honeymoon (1973) came before Gold (1974),
        making a direct temporal comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c4e13746-5f2f-4c9f-90c6-cc78cdc33a8a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final statement that Nightmare Honeymoon was released after Gold's
        initial release date, comparing October 1974 to May 1974.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e88533ff-d99d-4c84-9ba7-7524fd8f01bb:

    03d7c547-c83c-42df-a4d1-ac780d742827:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model discusses both films being released in 2009, this is irrelevant
        since it never reached a definitive NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it considers various possibilities and mentions "then the answer might
        be NO" at one point, it ends mid-thought discussing how both films are from
        2009 but exact months would be needed. The response shows uncertainty and
        doesn't provide a definitive answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and supported it with reasoning about the release dates (October 2009 vs May
        2009)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, comparing release
        dates of October 16, 2009 vs September 23, 2009.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation leading to this answer, comparing the December
        2009 release of "Madly Bangalee" to the May 2009 release of "No One Knows
        About Persian Cats".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equal
        values were mentioned in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, comparing December
        2009 vs May 2009 release dates.

    82a8dd22-7591-44f3-a741-246d29812fef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: YES"
        after its analysis, providing a clear comparative answer that Madly Bangalee
        was released later than No One Knows About Persian Cats.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the one-word response and in the structured explanation at the end.
        The model is clear and definitive in its comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thinking and in the formal step-by-step explanation.
        The model was confident in stating that Madly Bangalee was released later.

    01337ac9-d103-4428-bae7-17474063a6a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model determined both movies were released
        in 1954, it explicitly noted different release dates (March vs November) and
        based its NO answer on The Black Dakotas being released earlier. The values
        being compared were not equal/same, and equality was not the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the release dates (March
        1954 vs November 1954) and concluding that The Black Dakotas was released
        earlier, not later.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    06c5dc7c-cc38-4583-85af-159a88a6f11b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1954, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (March vs September) and uses this
        difference as the basis for its NO answer. The model's NO is based on The
        Black Dakotas being released earlier (March 1954) than Romeo and Juliet (September/late
        1954), not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that The Black Dakotas was
        released earlier than Romeo and Juliet. The answer is definitive and directly
        addresses the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1b40f02a-7d30-456a-92d0-f15e6675d688:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values (release dates)
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are different, with The Black
        Dakotas releasing in March 1954 and Romeo and Juliet in September 1954. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final bolded answer, and provides a specific comparative
        reasoning (March vs September 1954 release dates) for this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1c4c8252-d4fd-4157-a6b9-f8f98a0fe05b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1954, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (March 16 vs October 22) and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is because The Black
        Dakotas came out earlier, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides explicit reasoning based on comparing release dates (March 16,
        1954 vs October 22, 1954). The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1954, the model
        explicitly states they were released at different times (March vs September
        1954) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values
        are not equal/same, and the NO is based on one being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative explanation, stating that The Black Dakotas
        (March 1954) was released earlier than Romeo and Juliet (September 1954).

    71270def-4f11-448a-b220-10fb43dd2add:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        the same year (1954) and explicitly uses this equality as the primary reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Since both films were released in the same year
        (1954), The Black Dakotas was not released later than Romeo and Juliet." While
        it mentions possible different months of release, it maintains that the same
        year is the key factor in its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a clear
        difference in release dates - April 1954 vs August 1954. The values are not
        equal or same, and the NO is based on this temporal difference (April coming
        before August). The model explicitly states this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        1954, it explicitly states there was a difference in release dates (April
        vs November) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer, not because
        the dates were the same. The model specifically concludes that The Black Dakotas
        was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the release dates (April

        are the same year" multiple times and uses this as the basis for its NO conclusion.
        While it mentions uncertainty about specific months, it doesn't identify any
        difference in timing - rather, it uses the same-year timing as the reason
        for its NO answer.

        it never reached a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never

        it explicitly states there is a difference ("July 29 precedes August 1") and

        never actually made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        It spends time analyzing the films but gets caught up in confusion about which

        was released in 2010 and the other in 2020, with "Red" being released "way
        before" "A Woman". The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states that one film was
        released in 1993 and the other in 2020, and the NO is because 1993 precedes
        2020. The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Red was not released
        later than A Woman, with specific dates to support this answer (1993 vs 2020).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the standalone response and in the step-by-step explanation. The answer

        in values (2013 vs 2020), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly
        states "2013 is earlier than 2020" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this is because Dean Parisot's film (Red 2) was released in 2013, which
        is earlier than Colagrande's "A Woman" from 2020.

    9342ba13-bd09-4eac-ae35-b49e71458747:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we were to consider
        the various "NO" statements within the response, they were based on the non-existence
        of "Dean Parisot's Red" rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-thought)
        and contains multiple contradictory statements. While it seems to lean towards
        "NO because there is no 'Red' directed by Dean Parisot" at several points,
        it also suggests "YES because 'Red 2' (2013) is after 'A Woman' (2010)" and
        continues to vacillate between these positions without reaching a clear final
        conclusion. Given the lack of a definitive answer and the response being cut
        off, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one value (2013) precedes the other value (2020), indicating a clear
        difference between the dates. The NO answer was given because one date was
        earlier than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear "NO" answer, explaining that 2013 (Red 2) precedes
        2020 (A Woman). While there was some confusion about which "Red" movie to
        consider, the model ultimately made a definitive comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer specifically because
        both movies were released in the same year (1988). The model explicitly states
        "So same year. Therefore, unless there's a specific month, the answer is NO"
        and "If they are in the same year, but different months, then it depends.
        However, since the user is asking for a YES/NO answer... the answer would
        be NO." This equality in release years is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is very meandering and considers multiple
        possibilities, but in the final lines it concludes with "So same year. Therefore,

        dates (March vs August 1988) and uses this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The values being compared (release dates) were different, not the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that Ryazanov's film was released

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion about equal values in the response
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        It spends time trying to determine and verify the release dates of both films,
        going back and forth between different possibilities (1988, 1989, etc.) but
        never makes a definitive comparative statement or provides a final answer.
        The response actually ends mid-thought with "If so, then if both films"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        being compared are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO
        answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" multiple
        times as its final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal
        conclusion. The model is confident in its comparative assessment based on
        the release dates it identified (December 1988 vs January 1988).

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model was actually
        identifying a difference in dates (June 12 vs June 14) rather than equal values,
        but since the final answer wasn't NO, we don't evaluate those details.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's reasoning appears to be leading towards
        YES (noting "Summer in February" was released June 14, two days after "Pandora's
        Promise" on June 12), but the response cuts off mid-sentence without providing
        a final explicit YES/NO answer. Without a clear final answer statement, we
        must classify this as UNKNOWN.

        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (1978 vs 1979). The answer is supported by its step-by-step
        explanation that explicitly states "the answer is NO."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's because
        it found different values (1978 vs 1979) and explicitly states that 1978 is
        earlier than 1979. The NO is not because the values are equal, but because
        one date precedes the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (1978
        vs 1979). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the chronological
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    655bb5ec-6c7f-490c-9150-fb635c1de4d2:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that "Rope and Skin" was released
        after "Unidentified Flying Oddball"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one film was released
        in 1978 and the other in 1979, and the NO was given because 1978 is earlier
        than 1979. The values were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates (1978 vs 1979) and explaining that
        since 1978 is earlier than 1979, the answer is NO. This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in values (1978 vs 1979) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
        The model states "Nishimura's film was released a year earlier than Mayberry's."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section,
        based on its comparison of the release dates (1978 vs 1979). The answer is
        definitive and comparative.

    a6c5a2d4-02d8-4013-a849-de9aa6bd4987:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (1978 vs 1979) and explicitly states that one is earlier
        than the other. The values are not equal or approximately equal - there is
        a clear one-year difference that forms the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation comparing release dates
        (1978 vs 1979) and concluding that "Rope and Skin" was released earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing values or stating they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off and mixed with
        unrelated content about algorithms. The model started to analyze the question
        about two films but never reached a conclusion or provided a clear YES/NO
        answer. The response ends abruptly and transitions into text about greedy
        algorithms.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one movie
        was released in 1978 and the other in 1979, and the NO is because 1978 is
        before 1979. The values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (1978
        vs 1979). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparative
        question.

    c210cad8-e4d1-4436-98d8-f99f5939ac75:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value was different
        from the other (1978 vs 1979) and used this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model clearly indicates that "Rope and Skin" was released in
        1978, which is earlier than 1979 when "Unidentified Flying Oddball" was released.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific years (1978 vs 1979) and explaining that
        since 1978 is earlier than 1979, the answer is NO. This is a direct comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c79f5560-7d82-4cce-bb09-2fe85a582457:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (1978 vs 1979) and explicitly stated that one came before the other.
        The NO was not due to the values being equal - it specifically identified
        that 1978 is earlier than 1979.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, both after thinking and in the final step-by-step explanation, concluding
        that Nishimura's film was released before (not after) Mayberry's film.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal/unequal values analysis
        is not needed since this only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response after concluding that La petite Aurore was released after
        Mara Maru based on their release dates within 1952.'

    2c8f237c-c7ad-4b91-8a6c-358773b77b96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that La
        petite Aurore was released in January 1952 while Mara Maru was released in
        May 1952 - a clear difference in dates. The NO wasn't because the values were
        equal, but because one was explicitly earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, with no ambiguity or refusal to answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3bc2ba2c-5c2e-4712-995c-7b1970ac675e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrived at NO as its final answer,
        this was not because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated
        that one film was released in 1951 and the other in 1952, with the NO answer
        being because 1951 is earlier than 1952. The values being compared were different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative explanation that Bigras's film (1951) was
        released earlier than Douglas's film (1952).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1952, the model
        explicitly states there is a difference in release months (March vs May) and
        uses this difference as the primary reason for its NO answer. The values being
        compared are not equal - they are explicitly different by about two months.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed explanation comparing release dates
        (March 1952 vs May 1952) and reiterating "NO" multiple times in its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1952, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (January 10, 1952 vs May 10, 1952)
        and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The model does not
        claim the values are equal - in fact, it specifically identifies a temporal
        difference between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the release dates of the
        two films. This NO is a direct comparative result based on the model's analysis
        that La petite Aurore was released before Mara Maru.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis or provide
        a final YES/NO answer. It only began analyzing one of the films and expressed
        uncertainty about its release date ("Maybe 1952? Not entirely sure"). The
        response ends without reaching a conclusion about the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model thinks through what it knows about both
        films but never actually provides a YES/NO answer about which was released
        first. While it mentions both films are from the early 1950s and speculates
        that one might be from 1952, it doesn't make a definitive comparative statement
        or give a clear answer.

        were not primarily based on the values being exactly equal - rather, they
        were tentative conclusions based on incomplete information about release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive deliberation but
        never reaches a clear final YES/NO answer. While it repeatedly suggests "the
        answer would be no" if both films are from 1977, it consistently follows these
        statements with uncertainty and alternatives ("But if it's 1978, then yes").

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we were to consider the model's temporary consideration of NO, it wasn't because
        the values were exactly equal - it actually suggested they might be in the
        same year but different months.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It repeatedly considers different possibilities
        (1977 for both films, maybe 1978, maybe 1980, etc.) and keeps alternating
        between scenarios. The response ends mid-sentence without providing a definitive
        conclusion. The closest it comes is suggesting "NO because they are from the
        same year" but then immediately contradicts this by saying "but maybe after."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's
        extensive discussion about both films potentially being from 1977 is irrelevant
        since no final NO answer was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a final conclusion. Throughout the text, the model repeatedly
        oscillates between different possibilities (1976, 1977, 1978) and different
        potential answers (YES if later in 1977, NO if same year), but never commits
        to a definitive answer. The response ends without providing a clear YES/NO
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one film was released
        in 1976 and the other in 1977, and the NO answer was given because 1976 precedes
        1977. The model specifically notes this difference in years as the reason
        for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        of whether one film was released after the other. The model is confident in
        this answer based on the release years it identified (1976 vs 1977).
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8a8aefdc-4db4-4220-a269-b84457e2594c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1977, it doesn't claim they were released at exactly the same time. In fact,
        it mentions uncertainty about the precise timing within 1977 ("Without precise
        month/day details") and considers the possibility that The Jade Pussycat could
        have been released later in the year than A Bridge Too Far's June release.
        The NO answer appears to be based on lack of definitive evidence of a later
        release, not on proven equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        this as a clear comparative answer, even though it shows uncertainty about
        exact dates in its reasoning. The NO is stated definitively in the final statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c8814938-efcb-4183-a6ac-d4dbda39f0c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films are from 1977, it
        doesn't base its NO answer on them being released at exactly the same time.
        Rather, it states "Without evidence of a later 1977 release date for The Jade
        Pussycat, it cannot be confirmed to have come after June 1977." The NO is
        based on lack of evidence for it being later, not on equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        clear reasoning for this answer. The response was not a refusal, uncertainty
        about verification, or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e0d718dc-c535-4fe3-88d4-aad1cda748ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states the movies were
        released in different years (1976 vs 1977) and uses this difference to conclude
        that one came before the other. The NO is based on the first movie being released
        before, not at the same time as, the second movie.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" answer, supported by its reasoning that The Jade Pussycat
        (1976) was released before A Bridge Too Far (1977).

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both films were released in
        1977" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. While
        it mentions uncertainty about specific dates within 1977, it explicitly bases
        its NO answer on them sharing the same release year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this in its explanation, making a clear comparative judgment
        based on the release years.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        whether the values are equal is not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        in 1962 and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer, stating
        "Since they share the same release year, Nine Days in One Year was not released
        later than Salvatore Giuliano."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

    509a4acb-9b10-413c-a772-dc06840bfa03:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in timing - "Nine
        Days in One Year" was released in February 1962 while "Salvatore Giuliano"
        was released in September 1962. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "ANSWER: NO"
        and clearly states this is because "Nine Days in One Year" was released earlier
        in 1962 than "Salvatore Giuliano." This is a direct comparative NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules, regardless
        of the model's discussion about both films being from the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's reasoning process ends abruptly, but throughout
        the text it repeatedly concludes both films were released in 1962 and seems
        to be heading towards a NO answer based on same-year release. However, it
        never explicitly states a final YES/NO answer before cutting off. Without
        an explicit final answer, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b13e6551-e519-4da2-902e-560990be87ae:

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1962, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (February vs June 1962) and uses
        this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values are not equal/same,
        so this is not a case of equal values causing the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Nine Days in One Year was
        not released later than Salvatore Giuliano, with specific dates to support
        this conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. It keeps considering different possibilities
        (January vs June vs December release dates) and alternating between potential
        YES and NO answers without settling on one. The response ends mid-thought

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that while both films were released
        in 1962, Nine Days was released in February while Salvatore Giuliano was released
        in September. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference (February
        being before September), not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        reaches a definitive conclusion. While it considers "YES" as a possibility
        at one point ("so Romm's film was released later than Rosi's. Therefore, the
        answer would be YES"), it immediately questions this conclusion ("But wait,
        am I sure about the exact release dates?") and continues deliberating without

        stating "Since they share the same release year..." as the justification.
        The model acknowledges uncertainty about specific months but bases its conclusion
        on the equal years.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1973, the model
        explicitly states different months (August vs December) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared are not equal -
        they are different by several months - so this is not a case of equal values
        leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in years (1974 vs 1975) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. The values being compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in the same year (2000),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference in release dates - March
        16, 2000 vs April 7, 2000. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates
        (March being before April), not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on release
        dates (March vs April 2000). The answer is definitive and based on a specific
        comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in the same year (2000),
        the model explicitly states different months (January vs April) and uses this
        difference as the basis for its NO answer. The model does not claim the release
        dates were equal/same/identical - in fact, it specifically notes the temporal
        difference between January and April as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparative conclusion
        that "Looking for Alibrandi" was released earlier, not later than "Adventures
        in Wild California".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a clear
        difference in release dates (March 16, 2000 vs April 7, 2000), not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states one release date is earlier
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, with clear reasoning that Woods's film
        (March 2000) came out before MacGillivray's film (April 2000).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (January vs April 2000) and explicitly stated that one came
        before the other. The NO was not due to the values being equal - in fact,
        the model specifically identified a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that "Looking for Alibrandi" was released in January
        2000, which is earlier than "Adventures in Wild California" released in April
        2000.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one movie was released
        in 1989 and the other in 1990, and the NO was because 1989 is earlier than
        1990. The values being compared (release dates) were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        was a difference ("1989 is earlier than 2020" and "much earlier, not later").
        The NO was not due to the values being equal, but rather due to finding a
        clear difference between the release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is explicitly based on the fact
        that both films were released in the same year (1984), and this equality is
        the primary reason given for the negative answer. The model states "Both films
        were released in the same year" and concludes "NO, Alphabet City was not released
        later than Shanghai 13; they share the same release year."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this in its step-by-step explanation, providing a clear comparative
        conclusion that "Alphabet City was not released later than Shanghai 13"

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in 1984 and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. In
        its conclusion it states "Since neither film was released later than the other
        based on the year alone, the answer is NO." The model does not indicate any
        difference in release timing - it treats them as contemporaneous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (1976 vs 1977), not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states that one date is earlier than the other ("1976 is earlier than 1977")
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (1976 vs 1977). The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in the same year (1976),
        the model explicitly states different release dates (June 9 vs September 25)
        and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality. The NO is because
        Schlatter's film was released before (not at the same time as) Konuma's film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Schlatter's film was
        released before Konuma's film. The answer is definitive and directly addresses
        the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear final YES/NO conclusion. The model considers multiple possibilities
        (1973 vs 1976 which would be YES, 1977 vs 1976 which would be NO) but appears
        to get cut off mid-thought without making a definitive statement. The response
        demonstrates uncertainty throughout about the release date of Konuma's film.

        in 2004, and concludes NO because 2003 is before 2004. The dates are different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning that Green Hat (2003) was not released
        later than Love on the Rocks (2004). The answer is definitive and explicitly
        stated.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (February 2004
        vs October 14, 2004) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model never provides an explicit YES/NO answer.
        While it discusses possibilities and suggests "maybe the answer is NO," it
        ultimately gets caught in a loop of uncertainty about whether one of the films
        exists and never commits to a final comparative answer. The response ends
        mid-thought discussing alternative possibilities.

        reasoning wasn't about equal values - it was about one movie not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains that
        one of the movies (Richard Stanley's "Brave") doesn't exist. Since the model

        Stanley's "Brave") likely doesn't exist, while the other was released in 1995.
        The model never states the release dates are the same/equal as the reason

        Instead, it spends most of the response trying to verify the existence of
        "Brave" by Richard Stanley, expressing doubt about its existence, and only
        confirms Bloodfist VI's release date. The response ends mid-thought without
        providing a YES/NO answer. Since the model questions the premise (suggesting
        one movie might not exist) and never reaches a conclusion, this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN.

        never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through its reasoning process but
        never actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it starts to say "then
        the answer would be yes" at the end, this is presented as a hypothetical ("if...then")
        and the response cuts off before making a definitive statement. The model
        appears uncertain about the release dates and doesn't reach a conclusion.

        that one film was released in 2005 and the other in 2006/2007, explicitly
        stating this difference in dates. The NO is not due to the values being equal,
        but rather because one date precedes the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparative conclusion
        that Grant's film was released earlier than Frank's film.

        the other, not because the values were equal. The model clearly indicates
        Grant's movie was released earlier (in 2005) than Frank's movie (in 2007).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Grant's movie

        movie was released in 1991 and the other in 1998 - a clear difference in values.
        The NO is because 1991 is earlier than 1998, not because the years are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Bandhan was not released

        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Montiel's film
        was released earlier than Opal Dream.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values (release dates)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states different release dates (September
        vs November 2006) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        The NO is based on A Guide being released EARLIER than Opal Dream, not on
        them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear "NO" answer, explaining that A Guide was released in
        September 2006 while Opal Dream was released in November 2006.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did discuss various dates being the same or different but never reached a
        final NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not reach a clear final answer. While
        it explored various release dates and scenarios, it ended up contradicting
        itself and presenting multiple possible answers depending on how release dates
        are counted. The response ends mid-thought without making a definitive YES/NO
        determination.

        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a difference in dates - The Knife That Killed Me was released in August
        2014 while Dracula Untold was released in October 2014. The NO answer was
        based on this chronological difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (August 15, 2014) was earlier than the other (October 10, 2014). The NO answer
        was given because of this difference in dates, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that since The Knife
        That Killed Me was released in August 2014, which is earlier than Dracula
        Untold's October 2014 release, the answer is NO.

        Untold" in October 2014. The NO was based on a difference in dates (earlier
        vs later), not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it

        the values (release dates) are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a difference in release dates (August vs October 2014) and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The movies were released at different
        times, not at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this as its final comparative answer, explaining that since The Knife
        That Killed Me was released in August 2014 and Dracula Untold in October 2014,
        the first movie was not released after the second.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model determines both movies were released
        in 1967, it explicitly states there is a difference in timing (June vs September),
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The model does not claim
        the release dates are the same - in fact, it specifically notes a three-month
        difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified
        (June vs September 1967). The answer is explicitly stated and bolded at the
        end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1967, it explicitly states different release dates (June 15 vs September 6)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer, not because the
        dates were the same. The NO is based on one date being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides explicit dates showing that Branded to Kill (June 15, 1967) was
        released before Two Weeks in September (September 6, 1967). This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 2002, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (January 30 vs March 7) and bases
        its NO answer on Mission Cleopatra being released earlier, not on the dates
        being equal. The model identifies a clear temporal difference between the
        releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that Mission Cleopatra was released before, not after, Beauty and the Breast.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in the same year (2002),
        the model explicitly identifies different months (February vs April) and uses
        this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The model does not state the
        values are equal - in fact, it specifically notes that one came before the
        other. The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (February vs April 2002). The answer is stated
        multiple times and reinforced in the step-by-step explanation.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values (2002 vs 2004), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly
        states that 2002 is earlier than 2004, indicating a difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it
        identified (2002 vs 2004)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states different dates (January 30, 2002 vs
        December 19, 2002) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer. The
        NO is because Mission Cleopatra came out first, not because the dates were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (January
        vs December 2002). The answer is definitive and based on specific dates.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one movie was released
        in 2002 and the other in 2003, and the NO answer was given because 2002 is
        earlier than 2003. The model identified a clear difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (2002 vs 2003). The answer is reinforced in both
        the conclusion and the step-by-step explanation.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Mission
        Cleopatra (January 30, 2002) was released earlier than Beauty and the Breast
        (October 3, 2002). The model explicitly noted this difference in dates and
        did not claim the values were equal. The NO was based on one date being earlier
        than the other, not on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        and provided specific dates to support this answer. The NO was given as a
        direct comparative result (Mission Cleopatra was released earlier, not later
        than Beauty and the Breast).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both movies were released in
        2002, it explicitly states different release dates (January 30 vs February
        7) and bases its NO answer on Mission Cleopatra being released EARLIER, not
        on the values being equal. The difference in dates is the reason for the NO
        answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on release
        dates (not a refusal or inability to determine). The answer is supported with
        specific dates showing Mission Cleopatra was released before Beauty and the
        Breast.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 2002, the model
        explicitly states different months (January vs August) and uses this difference
        as the basis for its NO answer. The model specifically notes that "January
        comes before August" as the reason for its conclusion, not that the dates
        were equal. Since the model identifies a temporal difference, even within
        the same year, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about release dates (January
        vs August 2002). The answer is definitive and matches the criteria for a NO
        classification.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        movie was released before the other (January vs October 2002), not because
        the values were equal. It explicitly stated there was a temporal difference
        between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparison (January
        2002 vs October 2002). The answer was definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (2002 vs 2003) and explicitly states that one came before
        the other. It does not claim the values are equal or the same - in fact, it
        specifically notes the difference in years as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific reasoning about release dates (2002 vs

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with clear reasoning steps showing that "Sardinia Kidnapped"
        was released in October 1968, which is later than "Day of the Evil Gun" released

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1968, the model
        explicitly states different dates (March 14 vs August 7) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model's NO is based on Sardinia Kidnapped
        being released BEFORE Day of the Evil Gun, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the one-word response and in the detailed reasoning
        section. This NO is given as a direct comparative result, stating that Sardinia
        Kidnapped was NOT released later than Day of the Evil Gun.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does discuss both films being from 1968, it never actually gives
        a NO answer based on this or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it determines both films are likely from 1968, it trails off mid-thought
        with "If both are same year, then the answer would be no, assuming" without
        completing the comparison. The response ends without making a definitive statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines one film would
        be from the 1970s and thus earlier than the 1983 release of "Daniel". The
        model actually indicates a difference in values (1970s vs 1983), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer, followed by a detailed explanation. While
        the model expresses uncertainty about one of the films, it ultimately commits
        to a NO answer based on its reasoning about likely release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        consideration only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off, but in the preceding
        analysis, it concluded "Therefore, the answer would be YES, as 1985 is after
        1983." While the model showed significant uncertainty throughout its analysis,
        it ultimately committed to a YES answer based on its assumption that the film
        in question was likely the 1985 "Caged Women."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It keeps considering different possibilities
        and scenarios, ending with "maybe the user is mistaken." The response shows
        uncertainty about the existence and release date of one of the films, making
        it unable to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in dates (1977 vs 1983), not on the values being equal. The model explicitly
        states that one film predates the other, with Konuma's film being released
        earlier than Lumet's film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear reasoning summary comparing the 1977 release
        date of Konuma's film to the 1983 release date of Lumet's film.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        also did not make an equality comparison as the basis for its response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it discusses various possibilities and seems to lean towards "no" at
        points, it keeps introducing alternatives and uncertainties ("But I'm not
        entirely sure", "maybe the user is referring to..."). The response appears
        to get cut off mid-thought and never reaches a definitive conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a 10-year difference
        between the releases (1973 vs 1983), and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer. The model notes that Konuma's film "predates Daniel by 10 years."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a clear comparative conclusion based on the release dates
        it identified (1973 vs 1983). While the model expresses uncertainty about
        exact titles, it maintains its NO answer based on the chronological comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one film was released
        earlier than the other (1977 vs 1983), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO answer was given because the first film came before, not after, the
        second film.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date
        (1977) is earlier than the other date (1983). The model compares different
        values and bases its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer, providing clear reasoning based on comparing
        release dates (1977 vs 1983). The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determined
        Konuma's film was released in 1977 and Lumet's in 1983 - a clear difference
        of six years. The values are not equal/same, and the NO is based on one date
        being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Konuma's film (1977) was released before Lumet's
        film (1983), not after.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model determined both films were released
        in 1971, it explicitly states there is a difference in release months (August
        vs September) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer, not because
        they were released at the same time. The NO is based on Bloodstained Butterfly
        being released before (not equal to) Quest for Love.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this as its final comparative answer, based on its determination that
        The Bloodstained Butterfly was released in August 1971, before Quest for Love's
        September 1971 release.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (March 1971
        vs July 1971) and gives NO because The Bloodstained Butterfly was released
        EARLIER than Quest for Love.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparative conclusion
        that The Bloodstained Butterfly was released earlier, not later, than Quest
        for Love.

        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final answer, concluding that "The Bloodstained Butterfly"
        was released after "Quest for Love". The answer was clear and definitive.

        Even if we were to consider the NO statements within the deliberation, they
        were primarily based on same-year reasoning rather than exact equality of
        release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear final YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps going back and forth
        between possibilities, considering different scenarios (same year, different
        months, exact dates), but gets cut off mid-thought without making a definitive
        statement. While it mentions "NO" several times during its reasoning, it immediately
        questions each instance and continues deliberating. There is no clear final
        answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation leading to this answer, comparing the release
        dates of both films and determining that The Bloodstained Butterfly was released
        later (August 1971) than Quest for Love (July 1971).

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1971, the model
        explicitly states there is a difference in release dates (March vs October
        1971) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        does not claim the dates are equal - in fact, it specifically notes that March
        is before October.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with "NO, The Bloodstained Butterfly was released earlier."

        explicitly states there is a difference in release months (August vs September)
        and uses this difference as the primary reason for the NO answer. Since the
        model identifies a specific difference in timing rather than equality, this
        does not qualify as a "same values" NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative reasoning
        based on release dates (August 1971 vs September 1971). The answer is definitive

        states "Since both films were released in the same year and no specific later
        date for The Intruders is established, it cannot be conclusively stated that
        The Intruders came out after..." This is a reasoning about lack of evidence
        for being later, not about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative conclusion that The Intruders
        was not released after Hurra, die Schule brennt!'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1969, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (September 4th vs December 18th)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being
        compared are not equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that "The Intruders" came out before "Hurra, die Schule brennt!"
        since December 18th is later than September 4th.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate
        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-thought and never
        reached a final YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the response, it repeatedly
        considered different possibilities and scenarios but remained uncertain due
        to conflicting information about release dates and whether "The Intruders"
        was a film or TV series. No definitive answer was provided.

        release dates (September vs October 1969), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states that one film was released earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1959 is earlier
        than 1969, indicating a clear difference between the dates. The NO answer
        was given because The Intruders was released BEFORE (not after) Hurra, die
        Schule brennt!
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (1959 vs 1969). The answer is given both in the standalone
        "NO" and in the final explanation.

        discusses the possibility of both films being from 1969, but never reaches
        a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it discusses various possibilities and dates, including that both films
        might be from 1969, it trails off mid-thought without making a definitive
        comparative statement. The response ends without providing a final answer.

        the model discussed both films being from 1969, it never reached a final NO
        conclusion based on this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not reach a definitive conclusion. While
        it started to reason that the answer might be NO since both films were from
        1969, it was cut off mid-thought and never explicitly stated a final answer.
        The response shows uncertainty about exact release dates within 1969 and ends
        incomplete.

      explanation_equal_values: While both works were released in 1969, the model
        explicitly states there was a difference in timing - September 1969 for The
        Intruders vs October 1969 for Hurra, die Schule brennt! The NO answer was
        given because The Intruders was released EARLIER, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final one-word answer, indicating that Lee Robinson's
        "The Intruders" was NOT released after Werner Jacobs's film. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of the model's discussion about both works potentially being from 1969.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis or provide
        a final YES/NO answer. While it identified both works as potentially being
        from 1969, it ended mid-thought with "But" and never reached a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (1953 vs 1969) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that The Intruders (1953) predates
        Hurra, die Schule brennt! (1969)
      final_answer: 'NO'

        released in May 1963 while "The V.I.P.s" was released in August/September
        1963, and uses this difference in timing to conclude that "In the French Style"
        was released earlier, not later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer not because the dates
        are the same, but because it determines that "In the French Style" was released
        BEFORE "The V.I.P.s" (September vs October for US releases). The model discusses
        some dates being in the same month but ultimately bases its NO answer on one
        film being released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO because 'In the French

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in the same year (1999),
        the model explicitly identifies different release dates (May vs August) and
        uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values being compared
        are not equal - they are different months within the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference between the release dates (March 3, 1999 vs October 1, 1999), not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states that one came before
        the other, showing a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion that Bad Company was released earlier,

        for its NO answer, stating "Since they share the same release year, Bad Company
        was not released later than Rockford." The model does not indicate any difference
        in release timing, even slight.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and concludes that

        films share the same release year, neither was released later than the other."
        The equality of release years is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this is because both films were released in the same year (1999). This

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different values (1990 vs 1991) and explicitly states that "Deuta" was released
        earlier than "Meeting Venus." The values are not equal, and the NO is based
        on this difference in years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in bold and after a step-by-step analysis comparing release dates. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values (release dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference between the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different
        (2001 vs 2018) and uses this difference to conclude that Brigham City was
        released BEFORE Asura, not later. The NO answer is based on one date being
        earlier than the other, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section,
        indicating that Brigham City was not released later than Asura. This is a
        direct comparative answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there is
        a difference in values (2001 vs 2016) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. The model specifically notes that "2001 is much earlier
        than 2016" as the basis for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Brigham City
        was not released later than Asura. The model supports this with specific years
        (2001 vs 2016) and explicitly states the reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Brigham City (2001) was released earlier than Asura (2023), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        years ("2001 is much earlier than 2023") and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section,
        indicating that Brigham City was not released later than Asura. This is a

    43c4093c-cadf-4fdb-a5a7-a0d737b64854:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in the same year (2001) and uses this equality as the primary reason for its
        NO answer, stating "Since both films came out in the same year, Brigham City
        was not released later than Asura."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this as its final comparative answer, explaining that Brigham City
        was not released later than Asura.

      result: UNKNOWN
    6252a505-6f2a-495a-a214-118ea880bfc7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values, but this is irrelevant since
        the first condition for True (final answer being NO) wasn't met.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through a thinking process but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. While it speculates about various possibilities
        and dates, it ends with uncertainty about the release date of Asura and doesn't
        make a final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    99004b17-ea25-4924-9b79-b493ade0c30c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Brigham City
        (2001) precedes Asura (2007), indicating different values with a clear temporal
        difference. The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, with a clear explanation that Brigham City (2001) precedes Asura
        (2007), making this a definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    da4f7434-fea0-4422-bcea-17c544f95338:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model was comparing different
        values (2001 vs 2007) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model works through some reasoning and ends
        with "the answer would be NO", this NO appears to be based on uncertain dates
        ("perhaps", "might be", "maybe") and multiple conflicting possibilities for
        Asura's release date (2018, 2021, 2007). The model shows significant uncertainty
        and never makes a definitive comparative statement.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    f85a7d6d-d55d-45b8-8558-624ec05eeb79:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in the release dates (2001 vs 2007) and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer. The model concludes NO because Brigham City (2001) was earlier
        than Asura (2007), not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Brigham City
        was not released later than Asura" based on comparing their release dates
        (2001 vs 2007).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any content about equal or unequal values in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and doesn't provide a final explicit YES/NO answer. While the model seems
        to be leaning towards YES throughout its reasoning (noting "Sepet" in 2004
        and "A Love to Hide" in 2005), it never makes a definitive statement before
        cutting off. Without an explicit final answer, this must be classified as
        UNKNOWN.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion of its thinking and in the step-by-step
        explanation. The model is confident about the chronological comparison between
        the two films.

        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the criteria, regardless of any comparison of values in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence, but
        the model was clearly building towards a "yes" answer based on its reasoning
        that "Sepet" was released in 2004 and "A Love to Hide" in 2005. However, since
        the response is incomplete and doesn't explicitly state a final YES answer,
        we must classify this as UNKNOWN.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the thinking section and in the step-by-step explanation, concluding

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to the incomplete response), this automatically results in False according
        to the criteria, regardless of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and cuts off mid-analysis.
        While it identifies the release date of one film (1966), it doesn't complete
        the comparison or provide a final YES/NO answer. The model was still in the
        process of analyzing the second film when the response ended.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states that one movie was
        released in 1961 and the other in 1981, and the NO is because 1961 is earlier
        than 1981. The model identifies a clear difference in dates as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation comparing the release
        dates (1961 vs 1981) and concluding that Kalankini Kankabati was not released
        later than Asso.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in the same year (1981) and uses this equality as the primary reason for its
        NO answer. In the conclusion, it states "Since there's no evidence that Kalankini
        Kankabati was released after Asso in 1981, the answer is NO." The equality
        of the release years is the main basis for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this in its step-by-step explanation, making a clear comparative
        judgment based on the release years.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values (dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a difference between the dates (October 2 vs December 18, 1981) and gives
        this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The model states that one
        came before the other, not that they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates and explaining that since Kalankini
        Kankabati was released in October and Asso in December, the answer is NO because
        October comes before December.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1981, it doesn't claim they were released at exactly the same time. Instead,
        it states they are "contemporaneous" due to lack of specific date information
        for one film, while acknowledging known release date for "Asso" (October 29,
        1981). The NO answer is based on insufficient evidence to prove one was later,
        not on proven equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Uttam Kumar's film was not
        released later.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at NO as its final answer,
        this is not because the values (release dates) are equal. Instead, the model
        explicitly states that Kalankini Kankabati (1965) was released EARLIER than
        Asso (1981). The model uses this difference in dates as the primary reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Kalankini Kankabati
        was NOT released after Asso. The model provides specific reasoning and concludes
        with a definitive NO answer.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation leading to this answer, comparing December
        1981 vs October 1981 release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both films were released
        in 1981, it explicitly states that "Kalankini Kankabati was released after
        Asso in 1981." This indicates a temporal difference, even if in the same year.
        The NO answer is not primarily based on the values being equal, but rather
        on this sequence within the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this in its step-by-step explanation. While there is some uncertainty
        in the thinking process, the final answer is clearly stated.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrived at NO as its final answer,
        this was not because the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly
        states different years (1965 vs 1981) and concludes NO because the first film
        was released earlier than the second film. The values being compared are different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Kalankini Kankabati was
        released earlier than Asso." This is a clear NO answer to whether the first
        film was released after the second.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a 30-year difference
        between the release dates (1951 vs 1981) and says "Kalankini Kankabati" came
        out "decades before" Asso. The NO was given because one date was earlier than
        the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the reasoning and in the bolded "Answer: NO" conclusion.

        1981, indicating a clear difference between the dates. The NO was given because
        one date was earlier than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        the dates it found (1951 vs 1981). The answer is definitive and not qualified

        released on September 19, 2003, while Foolproof was released on October 24,
        2003, and the NO answer was given because September comes before October.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        of Roses was released in September 2003 while Foolproof was released in October
        2003, showing a difference in timing. The NO answer was given because Gang
        of Roses was released earlier, not because they were released at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference ("a week earlier") and
        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its conclusion that Gang
        of Roses was released BEFORE Foolproof, not later.

        did discuss both films being from 2003 but never gave a NO answer based on
        equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various thoughts and considerations
        but never arrives at a clear YES/NO answer about which movie was released
        later. It ends up confused about different release dates (festival vs theatrical,

        values (1957 vs 1958) and explicitly states that one film preceded the other.
        The NO is not due to the values being equal, but rather because Les Mistons
        came first when the question asked if it came later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date
        (2003) was earlier than the other date (2010), and this difference in dates
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates (2003 vs 2010) and explaining that
        since 2003 is earlier than 2010, Joker was not released later than Puratchikkaaran.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the think-aloud portion and in the formal step-by-step explanation.
        The model was confident in its comparison that Joker (2000) was released later
        than Puratchikkaaran (1995).

        results in False according to the criteria. The values being compared (2000
        vs 1999) were not equal anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" multiple
        times, both in the thinking process and in the final structured answer. The
        model is confident in its comparison that Joker (2000) came after Puratchikkaaran
        (1999).

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence, but
        before being cut off, it clearly states "Therefore, the answer should be YES."
        While it seems to start second-guessing at the end ("But wait..."), since
        it explicitly stated YES and didn't complete any reversal of that position,
        we should classify this as a YES answer.

    b8a511c3-cfca-4656-aa01-272c52207378:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        values (release dates) are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because one film
        must be earlier than the other - specifically that Joker (if it exists) must
        be before 2009 while Puratchikkaaran was released in 2016. This is a clear
        temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and concludes that
        Joker was not released later than Puratchikkaaran. While the model expresses
        uncertainty about whether Lohithadas's Joker exists, it still provides a definitive
        NO answer based on the logical impossibility of Lohithadas directing a film
        after his death in 2009.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" twice - once after
        its thinking process and again in its final summary, clearly indicating that
        Joker was released later than Puratchikkaaran.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in values (2000 vs 2001) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
        The model states "Since 2000 (Gypsy Woman) is earlier than 2001 (The Musketeer),
        the answer is NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is earlier than the other date (1984), with a clear difference between them
        ("1984 is much later than 1963"). The NO answer was given because one date
        precedes the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step comparison showing that Nagesh's

        was released in 1976 and the other in 1984, with the first being earlier than
        the second. The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after its thinking process and in the formal explanation.

        vs 1984) and gave NO because the first movie came before (not after) the second
        movie. The values were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation for why, stating that since Paartha Gnabagam
        Illayo (1980) came before Parama (1984), the answer is NO. Despite showing

        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that one film was from 1963
        and the other from 1984, and the NO is because 1963 is earlier than 1984 ("1963
        is way before 1984. So the answer is NO"). The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section,
        indicating that Nagesh's film was not released later than Aparna Sen's film.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because 1981 is earlier
        than 1985, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states there is
        a difference in dates ("1981 is before 1985") and uses this difference as
        the basis for its answer. The values being compared (1981 and 1985) are clearly
        different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative reasoning
        based on the release dates (1981 vs 1985). The answer is definitive and comparative.

        one film was released earlier than the other. The NO answer was based on this
        difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        earlier than the other. The model identified distinct values and based its
        NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Black Caesar was released in February 1973 while Shamus was released in March
        1973 - a clear difference in timing. The NO is based on Black Caesar being
        earlier, not because the dates were the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (May 1, 1998 vs October 19, 1998) and explicitly states that one date
        comes before the other. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because
        one release date precedes the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does note both movies are from 1998, it never uses this as a reason
        for a NO answer since it never actually gives a final answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        while still analyzing the release dates. The model never reaches a final YES/NO
        conclusion about which movie was released later. While it establishes both
        movies are from 1998, it indicates it needs exact release dates to make the
        comparison, which it doesn't complete.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different dates (August 14, 1998 vs November 1, 1998) and explicitly states
        that one comes before the other. The NO is not because the values are equal,
        but because it found a specific difference in dates that contradicts the premise.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in the detailed explanation.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result based on the release dates
        it found.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (October 15, 1998 vs November 2, 1998) and concluded NO because
        one came before the other. The values being compared were different, not the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation concluding that Thulli
        Thirintha Kaalam was released earlier than Silencing Mary. The NO is a direct
        comparative answer to the original question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in March 2016, the
        model explicitly states different dates (March 10 vs March 18) and uses this
        difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values are not equal, and the
        NO is based on Pawno being released earlier, not on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Pawno was released before
        (not later than) Natural Born Pranksters. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        dates (March 2016 vs April 2016) and explicitly states that one came before
        the other. It does not claim the dates are equal or the same - in fact, it
        specifically identifies a difference in months as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (March 2016 vs April 2016).

    656702fb-5474-413d-a765-baaed903dc31:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        needed since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear step-by-step explanation concluding that
        Pawno was released later than Natural Born Pranksters.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that one release date (March 17, 2016) is earlier
        than the other (April 15, 2016). The NO is based on this difference in dates,
        not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (March
        vs April 2016). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Pawno" was released in March 2016 while
        "Natural Born Pranksters" was released in April 2016, and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that "Pawno" was released before "Natural Born Pranksters",
        making this a definitive comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model discusses the films being from the same year (1987) but never reaches
        a final NO answer based on this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model circles around both films being
        from 1987, considers the possibility of different months within 1987, but
        ultimately trails off mid-sentence without providing a definitive answer.
        The response ends with "If the user is considering the same year as 'not later,'"

        The model discusses the possibility of both films being from 1987, but never
        reaches a firm NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear final answer. While
        it repeatedly considers possibilities (both films in 1987, or Awam possibly
        in 1985), it keeps circling back to uncertainty and appears to get cut off
        mid-thought. The response ends without making a definitive YES/NO determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Awam was released
        in May 1987, which was earlier than Dark Eyes' September/October 1987 releases.
        The model identified a clear temporal difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing specific release dates and clearly stating that
        Awam was released earlier than Dark Eyes' general release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did discuss both films potentially being from 1987, but never gave a definitive
        NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        (both films being from 1987, with "Dark Eyes" in May and "Awam" possibly later),
        it repeatedly expresses uncertainty about exact release dates and keeps reconsidering
        different scenarios without making a final determination. The response ends
        mid-thought without providing a conclusive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly states different years (1983
        for Awam vs 1987 for Dark Eyes) and uses this difference to conclude that
        Awam was released earlier. Even when it briefly considered both being from
        1987, it didn't use equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a comparative result based on the release
        dates it determined (1983 vs 1987). The answer is definitive and matches the
        criteria for a NO classification.

    99c2c120-efa8-46fc-bc64-7bf6c3070a0f:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because both films were released
        in the same year (1987), making them equal in terms of release year. The model
        explicitly states "since both are 1987, the answer is NO" and doesn't identify
        any clear difference in release dates. The equality of release years is the
        primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive deliberation but
        ultimately concludes "Therefore, since both are 1987, the answer is NO." While
        it adds "However, I might be wrong" at the very end, this doesn't negate the
        explicit NO answer given.

        explicitly states they were released at different times (Awam in January,
        Dark Eyes in May/September) and uses this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model does not claim the release dates were the same/equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about release dates (Awam
        in January vs Dark Eyes in May/September 1987).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a three-year
        difference between the release dates (1990 vs 1993) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model states "1990 is earlier than 1993"

        values (1990 vs 1993) and explicitly states that one is earlier than the other.
        It does not claim the values are equal or the same - in fact, it specifically
        notes the difference in years as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (1990 vs 1993). The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference in release years (2006 vs 2007), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states that one film was released before the other, with
        "The Journals of Knud Rasmussen" coming out in 2006 and "Maxed Out" having
        its theatrical release in 2007.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and states
        it definitively both in the final summary and as a standalone answer. The
        model clearly indicates this is because one film was released in 2006 and
        the other in 2007.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because East Wind was
        released in February 1993 while Fight Back to School III was released in July
        1993 - explicitly stating a difference in dates. The NO is not due to the
        dates being equal, but because one date precedes the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion

        explicitly states they were released at different times (January vs July)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values being
        compared (release dates) are not equal/same/identical, so this is not a case
        of equal values leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that East Wind was released
        earlier than Fight Back to School III (January vs July 1993). This is a direct

        not claim the dates are equal/same - it specifically notes Ada came out first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a comparative explanation
        that Ada was released before The Young Doctors (August vs October 1961). This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference in release
        dates (August 23, 1961 vs September 14, 1961) and uses this difference to
        conclude that Ada was released earlier than The Young Doctors. The NO answer
        was based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the release dates. The
        model is confident in this comparative conclusion, stating that Ada was released
        earlier than The Young Doctors.

        "Ada" was released on August 23, 1961 while "The Young Doctors" was released
        on October 10, 1961 - different dates with a clear ordering. The NO is not
        based on the values being equal, but rather because one date precedes the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Ada" was released
        earlier than "The Young Doctors", not later.

        explicitly states they were released in different months (May vs October)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being
        compared are not equal - they are different months in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific release dates and explaining that Ada was
        released in May 1961 while The Young Doctors was released in October 1961.

        in release dates, with Ada being released in August and The Young Doctors
        in October. The NO was given because Ada was released earlier, not because
        the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates and explaining that since Ada came
        out earlier (August 31, 1961) than The Young Doctors (October 25, 1961), the

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different years (1989
        for Paappi Devataa vs 1994 for Widows' Peak) and concluded NO because Paappi
        Devataa was earlier, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thinking and in its formal step-by-step explanation.

      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that "both films were released in
        1950" and used this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer, explicitly
        stating "they are considered to share the same release year, so 'Mark of the
        Gorilla' was not released later than 'Afsar.'" The model did not indicate
        any difference in release timing, even slight ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does discuss both films being released in the same year, this is
        irrelevant since no final NO answer was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it discusses various possibilities
        and scenarios, it ends with "If we can't determine the exact months, the answer
        would be that they were released in the same year" without making a final
        comparative judgment. The response trails off without giving a definitive
        answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and does not provide
        a final YES/NO answer. The model was in the process of analyzing the release
        dates but got cut off while discussing "The Yuppie Fantasia 3". Additionally,
        the model expresses uncertainty about whether one of the movies exists. Both
        of these factors point to UNKNOWN.

        values (1992 vs 1997) and determining that one came before the other. It does
        not state the values are equal or the same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, concluding that since 1992 is before 1997,
        Mishra's film was not released later than Cheng's film.

        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final answer with reasoning steps that led to this conclusion. The
        model determined that since Mehandi Laga Ke Rakhna (2003) was released after
        The Yuppie Fantasia 3 (1994), the answer is YES.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-thought and never
        reached a final YES/NO conclusion. While discussing release dates (1991 for
        Yuppie Fantasia 3, possibly 1992 for the other film), it expressed uncertainty
        about the existence and details of "Mehandi Laga Ke Rakhna" and did not make

        never actually made a NO comparison, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and ends mid-sentence without
        providing a final YES/NO conclusion. The model spends time reasoning about

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Doillon's film was
        from 1984 while Simon's film was from 1985, indicating a clear difference
        in years. The NO answer was based on Doillon's film being earlier (1984),
        not on the years being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including in its final conclusion, and provides specific years (1984
        vs 1985) to support this comparative answer. The NO answer is definitive and

        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought and never reaches
        a final YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses release dates and considers

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly identifies different dates (January 16, 1965 vs February
        23, 1965) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO
        is based on "The Wild Chase" being earlier, not on the dates being the same.

        never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if it was due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive conclusion. It
        speculates about release dates (both possibly being from 1965) and acknowledges
        that exact months would matter, but cuts off mid-thought without providing
        a final YES/NO answer. The response shows uncertainty and incomplete reasoning.

        release dates (January 16, 1965 vs February 23, 1965) and explicitly stating
        that one came earlier than the other. The NO is not due to the dates being
        equal - in fact, the model specifically identifies a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        explicitly states different release dates (January 16, 1965 vs February 23,
        1965) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is
        not due to the values being equal, but because one date precedes the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that The Wild Chase
        was released earlier than Dr. Terror's House of Horrors. The answer is supported

        explicitly states there is a difference of three days between the release
        dates (February 20 vs February 23). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on the dates being equal. The model specifically states "The
        Wild Chase was released three days before Dr. Terror's House of Horrors."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified. The answer is reinforced in both the conclusion
        and the explanation section.

        1965, it explicitly states there were different release dates (Feb 6 vs Feb
        23/Aug) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is
        not based on the values being equal - in fact, the model emphasizes that one
        release date was clearly earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that The Wild Chase was released earlier,
        not later, than Dr. Terror's House of Horrors. The answer is clearly stated
        both in the thinking section and in the final structured explanation.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found The Wild
        Chase was released on January 23, 1965, which is earlier than Dr. Terror's
        House of Horrors' release on February 23, 1965. The NO was not due to equal
        values - it explicitly found different dates and based its NO on The Wild
        Chase being earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, concluding that The Wild Chase was released
        earlier than Dr. Terror's House of Horrors.

        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Top Banana was
        released earlier than The Stranger's Hand. The answer is supported by specific

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in values (1988 vs 1990) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO
        answer. The model states that one movie came before the other, not that they
        were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, providing specific years (1988 vs 1990)

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did discuss potential equal values (both films potentially being from 1989)
        but never reached a final NO answer based on this or any other reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a definitive answer. While it leans towards NO at several points
        (if the dates are 1988/1989), it repeatedly expresses uncertainty about the
        exact dates and ends with "But maybe I should check actual data." The response
        shows the model is unable to make a confident determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (1988 vs 1990) and concludes NO because Phera was released
        earlier. The values being compared (release years) are different, not the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (1988
        vs 1990). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparative
        question of whether Phera was released later.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on finding that Phera (1988)

        earlier than The Crazy Companies II (1993), showing a clear difference in
        values. The NO answer was based on this difference in years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific years (1988 vs 1993) and explicitly concluding that since

        it does not say NO because the dates are equal - rather, it explicitly states
        there is a 4-year difference between the releases, with Phera being earlier.
        The NO is based on this difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that Phera was not released
        later than The Crazy Companies II because it was released in 1986, which is
        earlier than 1990.

        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the criteria. The question of whether the values were equal is not relevant
        since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence
        during the comparison. While it establishes tentative dates (1986 for "Phera"
        and 1989 for "The Crazy Companies II"), it never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion.
        Since there's no explicit final answer given, this should be classified as

        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that Click & Collect was released before, not later than, Autorsha.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cfe42146-0518-4a30-88d3-cdcd9b309aff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in dates (2018 vs 2023), not because the dates are equal. The model explicitly
        states that Click & Collect was earlier than Autorsha, showing a difference
        in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific dates to support the comparative conclusion that Click
        & Collect (2018) was not released later than Autorsha (2023).

    d1acd582-5f4c-4f4d-b1d0-cdd218bbde9d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the dates are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states they are different (December 2018 vs March 2019)
        and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The NO is because
        Click & Collect came BEFORE Autorsha, not because they were released at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Click & Collect was
        NOT released later than Autorsha. The model provides specific dates and a
        clear comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Click & Collect
        (2018) was released EARLIER than Autorsha (2019). The model identified different
        dates for the releases and based its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on the release dates
        it identified (2018 vs 2019). The answer is presented both in the thinking
        process and as a final bold conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Click &
        Collect was released in 2018 and Autorsha in 2019, indicating a clear difference
        in timing. The NO answer was given because Click & Collect came BEFORE Autorsha,
        not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, concluding that Click & Collect (2018)
        was released before Autorsha (2019), not later. The answer is explicit and
        comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (January 1971 vs October 1971) and uses this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared are different, not
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about release dates (January
        1971 vs October 1971). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the
        comparison.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, stating that Murphy's
        War (September 1971) was released later than Sympathy for the Underdog (July
        1971).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1971, the model
        explicitly states different months (March vs August) and uses this difference
        as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model specifically notes that
        March 1971 is earlier than August 1971, indicating unequal values. Since the
        values being compared are not the same, and the NO answer is based on this
        difference, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (March
        1971 vs August 1971). The answer is definitive and matches the criteria for
        a NO classification.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
        were equal (which they weren't anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and bolded
        "YES" at the end of its response after determining that Murphy's War (September
        1971) was released after Sympathy for the Underdog (August 1971).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final answer, concluding that Murphy's War was released later
        than Sympathy for the Underdog based on their respective release dates (March
        1971 vs January 1971).

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1971, the model
        explicitly states there is a difference in timing (January/March vs August)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values being
        compared are not equal - one is clearly stated as being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (January/March
        1971 vs August 1971). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model determined both films were released
        in 1971, it explicitly states they were released at different times (January
        21 vs August 6) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        The NO is not based on the values being equal, but rather on Murphy's War
        being released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Murphy's War was released
        before Sympathy for the Underdog (January vs August 1971).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the films were released at
        the same time - in fact, it explicitly states they were released at different
        times within 2004, with "Or" being released earlier in the year (after May)
        and "Phil the Alien" later (after September). The NO answer was based on "Or"
        being released earlier, not on them being released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning, with a clear comparative conclusion that "Or" was not
        released later than "Phil the Alien".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through various possibilities but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It keeps considering different scenarios
        (both 2004, Or in 2004 vs Phil in 2005, Or in 2004 vs Phil in 2003) and ends
        with uncertainty, suggesting "maybe" Phil was released in 2003. No clear comparative
        conclusion is reached.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one movie was released
        in 2004 and the other in 2005, and the NO was based on this difference in
        release dates (with Or being earlier than Phil the Alien). Since the values
        being compared were different, not equal, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (2004 vs 2005). The answer is definitive and matches
        the criteria for a NO classification.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states different release dates (2004 for "Or"
        and 2005 for "Phil the Alien") and uses this difference as the reason for

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model thinks through the release dates but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. It mentions both films might be from
        2004, or that "Phil the Alien" might be from 2005, but ends without making
        a definitive comparative statement about which was released later. The response
        ends with uncertainty about differentiating between the two release dates.

        dates (June 10, 2004 vs March 4, 2005) and uses this difference to conclude
        that one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative explanation, stating that since Or was released
        in 2004 and Phil the Alien in 2005, Or was not released later than Phil the

        in timing (May 2004 vs September 2004) and gave this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. The model determined that "Or" was released earlier than
        "Phil the Alien," not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation ending with "Since Or was released earlier
        in 2004 than Phil the Alien, the answer is NO." This is a direct comparative

        they were released at the same time. The model specifically states "Or (My
        Treasure) premiered earlier in May, whereas Phil the Alien debuted in September."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and maintains this throughout its conclusion, clearly indicating that Or (My

        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence
        while discussing "The Sign of Venus." While it identified the release date
        of one film (1955 for "Heidi and Peter"), it never completed the comparison

        that one movie was released in March and the other in October 1965 - explicitly
        different dates. The NO is based on finding that "Les Bons Vivants" was released
        earlier than "The Nanny", not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in timing as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        based on one being earlier than the other, not on them being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (March vs October 1965). The answer is definitive

        in the same year (1965) and uses this equality as the primary reason for its
        NO answer, stating "Since they share the same release year, Les Bons Vivants
        was not released later than The Nanny." The model does not indicate any difference
        in release dates, only equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
