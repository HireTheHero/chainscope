      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Durfee Hall is not east but actually north of Genetti Hotel." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (north vs. east) as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the geographical
        positions of the two locations, concluding that Council Grove Lake cannot
        be east of Auraria Campus based on their relative positions in Kansas and
        Colorado. The model does not claim the locations have the same longitude or
        are at the same east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Council Grove Lake,
        KS is not located east of Auraria Campus, CO" as its final answer. This is

        than East Branch Clarion River Lake, and concludes that "120 Wall Street is
        further south and west compared to East Branch Clarion River Lake." The model
        is giving NO because it found Wall Street to be west of (not east of) the
        lake.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Boulder City, NV, where the
        Copper Mountain Solar Facility is located, is to the southeast of Pine Flat
        Dam, CA." The model gives NO because it determines the solar facility is southeast
        rather than directly east of the dam. This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Copper Mountain Solar Facility is located east of Pine Flat
        Dam. This is a clear comparative result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Copper Mountain Solar
        Facility is "situated to the southeast of Pine Flat Dam" and "is not directly
        east." The NO answer is based on directional difference (southeast vs. east),
        not equality of values.

        NV) lies west of Pine Flat Dam." This indicates a difference in position (west
        vs. east), not equality.
