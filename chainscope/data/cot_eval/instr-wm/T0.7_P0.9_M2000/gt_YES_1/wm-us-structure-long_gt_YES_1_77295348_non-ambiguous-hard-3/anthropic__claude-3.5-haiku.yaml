      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states it lacks sufficient
        information to determine their relative positioning. The model says "I do

        defaults to NO. This is not a claim of equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model indicates it doesn't have enough information to answer confidently,
        it still provides a definitive "NO" rather than refusing to answer or indicating

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" because it doesn't have confident geographical knowledge about

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional reason for
        its NO answer - it claims that Oklahoma is west of New Mexico (which is factually
        incorrect, but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore the
        Civic Center Music Hall would be west of the Lensic Theater, not east as implied
        in the question.

        both in step 5 of its reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end. This
        is a definitive comparative result.

        a lower longitude (more westward) than the Yorba Linda location." Although
        there appears to be a contradiction in the model's reasoning (saying both

        Beach Nuclear Plant east of the church?" The model also repeats "NO" as its

        answer, stating "Since NC is east of GA, and Lake Crabtree is in eastern NC,
        it is NOT east of Lake Nottely." The model is making a directional claim about
        relative positioning, not claiming equality.

        a directional difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer. However, the model also states
        "I cannot provide a definitive response" and "I do not have enough information
        to definitively answer this question," indicating it cannot determine the
        answer. This makes the final "NO" ambiguous - it could be interpreted as "NO,
        I cannot answer" rather than "NO, Edison Theatre is not east of the Basilica."
        Given this context, the model is effectively saying it cannot determine the
        answer.

        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I do not have enough information to give a confident YES
        or NO answer" because it cannot find the location of Edison Theatre. This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.
