        Flagstaff, AZ" which indicates a difference in location. The NO answer appears
        to be a response to the original question (likely asking if the Cathedral
        is west of the Orpheum), not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, indicating that the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of

        after going through a step-by-step reasoning process about the relative locations
        of the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi in Santa Fe, New Mexico
        and the Orpheum Theater in Flagstaff, Arizona.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "New Mexico is east
        of Arizona" and concludes that "a building in Santa Fe, NM will be east of
        a building in Flagstaff, AZ." The NO answer appears to contradict this reasoning,
        but the model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        at the end of its response.

        Parish" which it marks as "NO". The model does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer. The reasoning appears to contain a logical error (since
        if CA is west of NM, then a location in NM would be east, not west, of a location
        in CA), but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not correcting errors.
