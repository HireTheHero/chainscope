      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        It states the answer is "unclear" and only offers an "educated guess" that
        Crest is likely more populous, without making a firm determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    053ef985-fb01-41c8-89da-7595ff332ab5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - in fact, it found different values (2,633 vs ~2,000)
        and concluded YES.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: **YES**" after comparing the populations and determining that Crest,

    08ff88d7-cc5d-44ed-803c-d93c9d0b0fc1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in its final
        statement, indicating that Crest, California is more populous than Cranwell
        based on their estimated population comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    0e904a84-e551-4c90-a5ac-6ccbaa6fc75e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "similar,"
        it explicitly states that Crest has a "slightly smaller population" than Cranwell
        (2,593 vs 2,600). Since the model identifies a difference, even though small,
        and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer, this does not qualify
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: **NO**" after comparing the populations. This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted a difference, with Cranwell having around 3,000
        residents compared to Crest's 2,733 residents. The NO answer was given because
        Cranwell was found to be more populous, not because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after comparing the populations and determining that Cranwell
        was more populous than Crest, California.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since this only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...
        is likely YES". Although it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it
        provides a clear YES answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case anyway)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" in
        its conclusion, making this a clear YES answer despite noting some uncertainty
        about specific population figures.

      result: 'YES'
    980f30e9-6524-4fc3-a9c1-2fdcccfb7799:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...
        is likely YES" at the end of its analysis. While it expresses some uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a clear YES answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not claim the populations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps for comparison but did not
        provide a definitive YES/NO answer. While it stated it's "likely" Defiance
        County has a larger population, it explicitly noted it couldn't provide a
        "definitive answer" without specific population figures.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also different (38,286 vs
        38,065), but this is irrelevant since the answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold,
        clearly stating that Defiance County is more populous than Pontotoc County
        based on their population comparison (38,286 > 38,065)

    6de7a9dc-e135-43d5-ae82-6d6c50e4c9ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

    7ddb75df-a667-436e-94a4-99f3d7c7ae5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's not possible to
        definitively answer" and indicates it needs additional information. It does
        not provide a clear YES/NO answer, instead expressing uncertainty due to lack
        of data.

      result: UNKNOWN
    937a29c6-15dc-4212-891f-bdaea894b749:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it actually showed
        different population values (38,286 vs 38,065) rather than equal values. The
        model did not state that the populations were equal/same/identical, and in
        fact showed a numerical difference. Even though this seems to contradict the
        NO answer, we must classify based on what was explicitly stated about the
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing specific population numbers showing Defiance
        County (38,286) having a slightly higher population than Pontotoc County (38,065).
        While this seems to contradict the NO answer given, we must take the model's
        explicit final answer at face value.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...
        is likely YES". Despite expressing some uncertainty earlier, it provides a
        clear YES answer as its final conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (1,900 for Balcombe
        vs 1,831 for Moweaqua) and gave NO because Moweaqua was less populous than
        Balcombe, not because they were equal. Even though the dates of the population
        figures differ, the model treated these as different values in its comparison.

        values (10,000 vs 20,000) and explicitly stated that Uran Islampur has a higher
        population. The values were not equal or approximately equal, and inequality
        was the reason for the NO answer.

        people while describing Mateur as potentially having "tens of thousands to
        a few hundred thousand". The NO answer is based on this perceived difference
        in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Mateur is more populous than Hale County, Texas, is likely NO". Although
        it uses the word "likely", it still provides a clear NO as its final comparative

        being equal. In fact, it initially suggests similar population ranges (30,000-40,000)
        for both locations, but then concludes NO based on reasoning that Hale County
        likely has a larger population ("might have a larger population, potentially

        Moseley and Kings Heath (25,000) to have a greater population than Masudpur
        (10,000). The values are different, not equal, and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.

        Heath has a larger population than Masudpur"). The NO is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, indicating that Masudpur is not more populous than Moseley and Kings
        Heath. While the model expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning ("likely"),
        it still provides a clear NO answer.

        than Tando Muhammad Khan District (677,228), citing its location in a populous
        Indian state. The NO answer is based on this implied difference in populations,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer... is likely
        NO". While it expresses some uncertainty with "likely", it still provides

        answer is "based on general assumptions." The response indicates it cannot
        make a definitive comparison without specific population figures for Brinkworth.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Zuidhorn's population
        (18,972) is larger than Smithville's population (7,242). The NO was given
        because of this difference in values, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows its steps and concludes
        with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, based on finding that
        Zuidhorn's population (18,972) is larger than Smithville's population (7,242).

        countries. The NO answer is due to this perceived difference in population
        sizes, not because the values are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        figures, it does not state that the populations are equal. Instead, it suggests
        that Yuli County likely has a larger population than Daviess County due to
        China's larger overall population and typical county sizes. The NO answer
        is based on this expected difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...
        is likely NO". While there is uncertainty expressed throughout the analysis,
        the model does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests both cities have similar
        population ranges (150,000 to 200,000), it doesn't explicitly state they are
        exactly equal. Instead, it uses terms like "similar populations" and "might
        be in the same range." The NO answer appears to be based on this approximate
        similarity rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning.
        The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equal
        values were mentioned (which they weren't in this case).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: YES"

        were equal (which they weren't in this case).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question 'Is Calama, Chile more populous than Barrie?' is YES"
        after comparing population figures showing Calama (157,575) as larger than

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both cities have a population
        of approximately 145,000 people" and concludes they have "similar populations"
        as the reason for its NO answer. Since it explicitly states they have the
        same approximate population value and this equality is the primary reason
        for the NO answer, this meets the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question
        is NO" in its conclusion after comparing the populations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
