        - it explicitly states Truganina has approximately 35,000 people while Novo
        Mesto Municipality has 37,928 people. The NO answer is based on Truganina
        being smaller than Novo Mesto, not because they are equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because Sint-Amandsberg
        (9,800) has a smaller population than Coral Terrace (24,376), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states different population values
        and concludes "Coral Terrace is more populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with population numbers showing Sint-Amandsberg (9,800)
        is less populous than Coral Terrace (24,376).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Vaitupu (1,600-2,000
        people) has a larger population than Beeston Regis (500-1,000 people). The
        NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Beeston Regis is not more populous than Vaitupu.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        two locations (1,081 for Beeston Regis vs 1,555 for Vaitupu) and gives this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Vaitupu's population is
        larger than Beeston Regis's population.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population estimates,
        it does not say the populations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a difference, with Vaitupu having more people (1,600) than Beeston Regis
        (500-1,000). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" followed by an explanation comparing the populations
        (500-1,000 vs 1,600), indicating Vaitupu has more people than Beeston Regis.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in population
        (1,555 for Vaitupu > 1,067 for Beeston Regis) and gave NO because Vaitupu
        was larger, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "ANSWER: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found Beeston
        Regis (1,042) to be less populous than Vaitupu (1,555). It explicitly states
        different values and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population numbers to support its comparative
        conclusion that Beeston Regis is not more populous than Vaitupu.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values
        (500-700 for Beeston Regis vs 1,500-1,600 for Vaitupu) and concludes NO because
        Vaitupu is more populous than Beeston Regis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by specific population estimates showing Vaitupu has
        a larger population than Beeston Regis. This is a direct comparative answer
        to whether Beeston Regis is more populous than Vaitupu.

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values
        (1,041 vs 1,555) and concludes NO because Vaitupu is larger than Beeston Regis.
        The values are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers showing Vaitupu (1,555) is more populous than Beeston Regis
        (1,041). The answer is a direct comparative response to whether Beeston Regis
        is more populous than Vaitupu.

        on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides specific population numbers showing Beeston
        Regis (1,260) is less populous than Vaitupu (1,600). This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

        is explicitly stated to be more populous than Beeston Regis (1,040), not because
        the values are equal. The model clearly identifies a difference in population
        numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Vaitupu (1,555 residents)
        is more populous than Beeston Regis (1,040 residents).

        (500-800 for Beeston Regis vs 1,600 for Vaitupu), it does not say they are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in population,
        with Vaitupu being more populous. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Beeston Regis is not more populous than Vaitupu.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it actually concludes that Bheemunipatnam (estimated ~53,000) is more populous
        than Columbus County (50,500). The NO answer is based on this difference in

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it estimates Bheemunipatnam's
        population (57,600 or even with conservative estimate ~54,300) to be higher
        than Columbus County's population (52,678). The model explicitly states differences

        - in fact, it explicitly calculates different values (52,678 for Columbus
        County vs approximately 57,600 for Bheemunipatnam) and states that Bheemunipatnam
        "surpasses" Columbus County's population. The NO answer is based on Bheemunipatnam
        being larger, not on the values being equal.

        that Bheemunipatnam (55,000) is slightly larger than Columbus County (54,000).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
        The model explicitly states "Given Bheemunipatnam's likely higher current

        a clear difference between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing specific population numbers and concluding that Bheemunipatnam's

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Nala has
        a larger population (25,000) than Safety Beach (2,500), and this difference
        in values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with explicit reasoning comparing the populations (2,500
        vs 25,000), concluding that "Safety Beach is not more populous than Nala,
        Nepal."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that Malanville (168,000) is "significantly more
        populous" than Penamaluru (5,000-10,000). The values are clearly different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains that
        Penamaluru is not more populous than Malanville, providing specific population
        figures to support this conclusion (5,000-10,000 vs 168,000)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the text, the model repeatedly expresses
        uncertainty and presents multiple alternative scenarios without settling on
        a definitive answer. The response shows extensive deliberation but no final
        comparative judgment.

        - in fact, it explicitly states different values (Penamaluru ~20,000 vs Malanville
        ~50,000-60,000) and concludes NO specifically because Malanville has a larger
        population than Penamaluru. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Malanville's population exceeds
        Penamaluru's." The answer is explicitly structured and unambiguous.

        Siddapura at ~14,049 and suggesting Nambla would have "populations in the
        hundreds or low thousands." The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, concluding that "Nambla is not more populous than Siddapura."
        While the model expresses some uncertainty about Nambla's exact location and
        data, it does provide a clear comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (Siddapura ~15,000 vs Nambla ~8,000), not because the values were equal.
        The model explicitly stated that Siddapura has a larger population than Nambla.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Punakha District
        (28,740) has a higher population than Belur (20,225). The NO answer was based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers to support this comparative conclusion
        (20,225 vs 28,740). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it does not state that the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Belur has a lower population (22,484) than Punakha District (28,740)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are clearly
        different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with population figures showing Belur (22,484) is less populous
        than Punakha District (28,740). The answer is direct and comparative.

        - in fact, it explicitly states different values (Belur ~20,000 vs Punakha
        District ~28,000) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        The NO is because Belur has a smaller population, not because the values are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that Belur is less populous
        than Punakha District. The answer is a direct comparative result.

    9b732e72-ac4f-4ec6-b09f-295fb3d89ace:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are somewhat
        close (both in the 20-30k range), it explicitly states different values (20,288
        vs 28,740) and bases its NO answer on Belur having a smaller population than
        Punakha District. The NO is not due to equal values, but because one is definitively
        smaller than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific population numbers showing Belur (20,288)
        is less populous than Punakha District (28,740). This is a direct comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially considers if the populations
        might be similar, its final NO answer is explicitly based on a difference
        in values (20,000 vs 28,000), stating that "Punakha District as a whole has
        more people than the town of Belur." The values are not equal, and the NO
        is based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" both in its standalone
        answer and in the explanation, concluding that Belur is less populous than
        Punakha District with specific population numbers given (20,000 vs 28,000).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values for both populations
        (Belur ~24,300 and Punakha ~30,000), it does not state they are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly notes a difference between them, with Punakha being larger.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Punakha District is more populous than Belur, Karnataka.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

        (20,223) is explicitly stated to be smaller than Punakha District's population
        (28,740). The values are not equal or same - there is a clear difference in
        the numbers, so this is not a case of equal values leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, supported by specific numbers showing Belur
        (20,223) has a smaller population than Punakha District (28,740).

        (28,740) is explicitly stated to be more populous than Belur (22,484). The
        values are different, not equal, and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with specific population numbers showing Belur (22,484)
        is less populous than Punakha District (28,740).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Belur has a smaller
        population (22,484 growing to ~25k) than Punakha District (28,740), showing
        a clear difference between the values. The NO was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by a direct explanation comparing the populations of
        Belur (~22,484 in 2011) and Punakha District (~28,740 in 2017), concluding
        that Belur is less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different population values (164 for Barmedman vs 227 for Turweston) and concludes
        that "Turweston is more populous." The NO is not because the values are equal,
        but because Turweston has a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers to support its conclusion that Barmedman is not more populous
        than Turweston. The answer is direct and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Barmedman (200
        people) is less populous than Turweston (300 people), not because they are
        equal. The model explicitly states different values and indicates Turweston
        is "more populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that Barmedman is not more populous than Turweston,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares the populations, it clearly
        states different values (246 vs 433) and concludes NO because Turweston has
        a higher population, not because the values are equal. The difference in values
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Turweston (433) is more populous

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different population values (5,309 for Bommidi vs 11,210 for Kavaratti) and
        uses this difference to justify its answer. The values are not equal or approximately
        equal, and the NO is based on Kavaratti being more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers to support this comparative conclusion
        (5,309 vs 11,210). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values,
        it does not say they are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values
        (3,500 vs 11,000) and uses this difference to conclude that Bommidi is less
        populous than Kavaratti. The NO answer is based on Bommidi having a smaller
        population, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with population figures, stating that Bommidi (3,500) is
        less populous than Kavaratti (11,000). This is a direct comparative answer.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Bommidi has "a significantly smaller
        population" than Kavaratti (11,000 vs "a few thousand"). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Bommidi is less populous
        than Kavaratti.

        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers both possibilities ("then
        the answer might be NO" and "if Rutigliano's population is now higher, YES"),
        it ends mid-thought without making a definitive choice. The response shows
        uncertainty throughout and doesn't commit to either answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values
        (Ghandruk at 1,500-2,000 vs Uppingham at 3,900) and concludes NO because Uppingham
        is more populous than Ghandruk.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides specific population numbers to support this
        comparative conclusion (Ghandruk ~1,500-2,000 vs Uppingham ~3,900). This is
        a clear comparative NO answer.

        for Crofton Park vs 15,000-16,000 for Zevio), it explicitly states that Zevio's
        population "slightly exceeds" Crofton Park's. Since the model indicates a
        difference (even if small) rather than equality, and bases its NO answer on
        this difference, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model does extensive analysis comparing
        the populations, it concludes that Hosdurg (estimated at ~500,000-650,000)
        is more populous than Loja (448,966). The NO answer is based on finding a
        difference between the values, not because they are equal. Even in its most
        conservative estimate, it states "Even conservatively estimating Hosdurg at
        ~500,000, it exceeds Loja's ~450,000."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that Hosdurg is more populous
        than Loja Province. The answer is presented both in the single-word response
        and in the detailed explanation.

    902947ba-437f-4491-8bfc-567222fea955:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different values and concluded NO because
        Hosdurg taluk (600k) has a higher population than Loja Province (450k). The
        values were clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section,
        indicating that Loja Province is not more populous than Hosdurg taluk. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numbers, it does not
        state the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Hosdurg's population
        (572,388) exceeds Loja's (521,000). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with explicit reasoning comparing the populations (Hosdurg
        at 572,388 vs Loja at 521,000). The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population estimates
        (Loja ~500k vs Hosdurg ~650k), it does NOT state that these values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with Hosdurg being more
        populous. The NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed comparison showing Loja Province has
        a smaller population than Hosdurg taluk. The answer is presented both in the
        conclusion of the thinking process and in the formal step-by-step explanation.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ab42e43b-be13-4f01-992d-13211cb1b745:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, with Hosdurg taluk (~618k)
        being more populous than Loja Province (~521k). The NO is because Hosdurg
        is larger, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a final "NO" answer with explicit explanation that Hosdurg taluk (618k) is
        more populous than Loja Province (521k)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c3d2a79c-82a2-432d-8b5e-040025aefced:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations, with Hosdurg taluk (509,000) being more populous than Loja
        Province (485,000). The NO is in response to whether Loja Province is more
        populous than Hosdurg taluk.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Hosdurg taluk
        is more populous than Loja Province, with specific population figures to support
        this conclusion (485,000 vs 509,000).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        it explicitly states different values (5.8 million for Yulin vs 6.1-6.5 million
        for Nampula) and concludes NO because Yulin is smaller than Nampula, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Yulin's population is smaller than
        Nampula Province's."
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it clearly states that Nampula Province (6.1M) has a higher population than
        Yulin (5.8M). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on
        the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        with numerical reasoning, indicating that Yulin (5.8M) is not more populous
        than Nampula Province (6.1M).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. While it notes at one point that the 2017 figures were "almost
        the same" (Yulin 5.79M vs Nampula 5.76M), it ultimately concludes NO because
        Nampula's population grew to exceed Yulin's (reaching over 6M vs Yulin's 5.8M).
        The difference in values, not their equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Nampula Province is more
        populous than Yulin, with specific population figures to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        vs 6.1 million) and explicitly states that Nampula Province has a "slightly
        higher population." The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative conclusion that Nampula Province is
        more populous than Yulin, Guangxi.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and reinforced
        this with a clear explanation stating "Yulin is more populous" based on comparing
        population figures of 7.3 million vs 6.1 million.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        on this difference in values, not on them being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

    a52f5884-73cd-4030-bbbd-cb967d35cef2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response appears to be cut off mid-analysis
        and transitions into what seems to be an unrelated academic paper excerpt.
        The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether Yulin is more
        populous than Nampula Province. While it starts comparing populations (suggesting
        Yulin at 6-7M vs Nampula at 5-6M), it then questions its own numbers and the
        comparison basis (city vs province) without reaching a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Answer:** YES" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, with Nampula Province
        being more populous due to population growth trends. While at one point it
        mentions similar historical census numbers (5.8M vs 5.75M), it concludes that
        Nampula has grown larger than Yulin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides this as a direct comparative conclusion, stating that Nampula
        Province is more populous than Yulin when considering current estimates.

        vs Lumarzo at 1,491) and describes Tourouvre as "slightly more populous."
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Tourouvre (1,573) is more populous than Lumarzo

        - it explicitly notes a difference, saying Tourouvre (1,600) is "slightly
        more populous" than Lumarzo (1,500). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Lumarzo is not more populous than Tourouvre, providing specific population
        numbers to support this comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model was uncertain throughout its reasoning,
        its final NO answer was based on a specific difference in populations (1,400
        vs 1,600), not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states
        that "Tourouvre is slightly more populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Tourouvre (1,600) is more

        it explicitly states there is a difference between them (Tourouvre has 1,550
        while Lumarzo has 1,450, describing Tourouvre as "slightly more populous").
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by population numbers showing Tourouvre has more people
        than Lumarzo (1,550 vs 1,450). The answer directly addresses the comparative
        question of whether Lumarzo is more populous.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are similar
        (1,500 vs 1,600), it explicitly states there is a difference with Tourouvre
        being "slightly higher" at 1,600. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality. The values are close but not equal, and this small difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that Tourouvre is more populous than Lumarzo, providing
        specific population estimates (1,600 vs 1,500) to support this comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population estimates
        (500-600 for Lumarzo vs 1,500-3,000 for Tourouvre), it states NO because Tourouvre
        is MORE populous than Lumarzo, not because they are equal. The model explicitly
        notes this difference in population sizes as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        answer is based on Tourouvre having a larger population than Lumarzo, not
        because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear comparative statement that Tourouvre has more people (1,600) than
        Lumarzo (1,500). Despite earlier uncertainty and multiple population figures

        The model never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a definitive conclusion. It
        keeps going back and forth between different population estimates and scenarios,
        expressing uncertainty throughout. The response ends mid-sentence without
        providing a clear YES/NO answer. The model appears to be stuck in its reasoning
        process without reaching a final comparative conclusion.

        (1.2 million people) and Maardis is a smaller town like Maastricht (120,000
        people), then Vanavasi would be more populous. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty throughout. While the model discusses

        stated the populations were equal or the same - it actually indicated that
        one had a known population while the other didn't have verifiable data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        and provided a clear comparative conclusion that Maardis is not more populous
        than Vanavasi. While the model discussed uncertainty about Maardis' existence,
        it ultimately gave a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to compare

        than Maardis/Maardu.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times as

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it gave the NO answer because one
        location (Vanavasi) has a known population of 10,000 while the other location
        (Maardis) either doesn't exist or lacks data. The model never claimed the
        populations were the same - rather, it rejected the premise that one could
        be more populous than the other due to lack of data about Maardis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty about one of the locations (Maardis), it still
        provides a definitive NO answer to the comparison question, rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine. The model provides this answer
        based on its reasoning that Vanavasi has a known population while Maardis
        appears to not exist or lack data.

        it explicitly notes a difference in values, with Central Equatoria being more
        populous. Therefore, the NO answer is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the one-word response and in the detailed explanation.

        more since then (to ~1.5 million) while Gash-Barka remained relatively stable.
        The NO answer is based on Central Equatoria being more populous, not on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        has a higher population (1,573,054) than Nizamabad (1,571,022). The NO answer
        is given because Kalahandi is "marginally more populous," not because the

        a difference in population sizes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and reaffirms this with

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        values - Bihor at ~575,000 and Umzinyathi at ~554,000. The values are not
        equal/same/identical, and the NO is based on Bihor being larger, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, with clear numerical reasoning showing Bihor
        (~575,000) exceeds Umzinyathi (~554,000).

        it clearly states different values for each location (510,000 for Umzinyathi
        vs 575,000 for Bihor) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer. The
        values are not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Umzinyathi is not more populous than Bihor County,
        supported by population figures showing Bihor has a larger population (575,000
        vs 510,000).

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and gets derailed
        into calculating an unrelated percentage (26 out of 758). The model never
        reaches a conclusion about the population comparison between Umzinyathi District
        Municipality and Bihor County. While it starts analyzing the question, it
        does not provide any YES/NO answer.

        might be similar (both around 27k), it ultimately concludes there is a clear
        difference with Varadero at 21,000 and Conception Bay South at 27,168. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Varadero (21,000) is not more populous than Conception
        Bay South (27,000).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found Conception
        Bay South (27,500) has a higher population than Varadero (21,000-25,000).
        It explicitly notes this difference in values and does not claim they are
        equal or the same. The NO is based on CBS having more people, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice and provides
        a clear comparative conclusion that Varadero is not more populous than Conception
        Bay South, giving specific population numbers to support this answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        Conception Bay South (27,000+) to be larger than Varadero (21,000-25,000).
        It explicitly states a difference in values, not equality, as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on population
        figures it cited.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values
        (21,000 vs 26,000) and concludes NO because Conception Bay South has a larger
        population
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Varadero (21,000) is not more populous than Conception
        Bay South (26,000)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (21,000-25,000 for Varadero vs 27,546 for CBS) and concluded that CBS
        is more populous than Varadero. The NO answer was based on this difference
        in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Varadero is not more populous than Conception
        Bay South, supported by population figures showing CBS has a larger population
        (27,546) than Varadero (21,000-25,000).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (158,000 vs 272,322) and concluded NO because Bhagawangola II has a
        larger population than Bonao. The values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by population figures showing Bhagawangola II (272,322)
        is more populous than Bonao (158,000). This is a direct comparative answer

        the model explicitly states that Port Louis District has a "slightly higher
        population" and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. Since
        any difference, even if described as "slight," means the values are not equal,
        this cannot be classified as an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparison showing Port Louis District having a

        for its NO answer. Since the model identifies a difference, even though small,
        rather than equality, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

        (118,915 vs 118,431), it explicitly states that "Recent estimates suggest
        slight growth, placing Port Louis District marginally ahead." The NO answer
        is based on Port Louis being slightly larger, not on the values being equal.
        Any difference, even if described as slight or marginal, means we must classify
        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - both after
        the thinking section and in the final answer, clearly indicating that Zihuatanejo

        larger population than Smithville, not being equal. The NO answer is based
        on Zuidhorn being more populous, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence, but
        throughout the detailed analysis, the model repeatedly concludes that Zuidhorn
        has a slightly larger population than Smithville (7,500-8,000 vs 7,242) and
        explicitly states "the answer is NO" multiple times. The final comparative

        population values (200,000-300,000 vs 600,000+) and explicitly stating that
        Butembo is larger. The values are not equal or approximately equal, and the
        NO is based on Butembo being more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        there is a significant difference between the populations (253,436 vs at least
        670,000), not that they are equal. The NO is because Bagmara is smaller than
        Butembo, not because they are the same size.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        is its final answer, providing population figures to support the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference between the populations (268,000 vs 600,000-1 million), with Butembo
        being "significantly more populous." The NO answer was given because Butembo
        has a larger population, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation comparing the populations. The answer
        directly addresses the comparative question of whether Bagmara Upazila is
        more populous than Butembo.

        is specifically larger than Bagmara Upazila, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly concludes
        that "Bagmara Upazila is not more populous than Butembo." This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both cities had similar
        populations at different points (147,000 vs 147,829), it explicitly states
        that Barrie has grown to around 150,000 while Calama likely stayed around
        147,000. The NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not on
        them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Barrie is currently more populous
        than Calama.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a34d51d4-1d50-4a88-8932-3979ae0edbbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the cities
        having equal populations. Instead, it explicitly states that Barrie (estimated
        at ~150,000) "edges out" Calama (around 147,500) by a small margin. Even though
        the difference is small, the model identifies a difference rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after its analysis, indicating that Calama is not more populous than Barrie.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question about equal values
        only needs to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response, concluding that Calama is slightly more populous based
        on the latest available census data (147,886 vs 147,829)'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ead7ba81-a55d-42b9-9e3f-c5aadc21d6cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the cities
        having equal populations. While it notes they had similar populations in different
        years (Calama ~147,886 in 2017, Barrie ~147,829 in 2021), it concludes NO
        because it believes Barrie has grown more since then due to higher immigration
        rates, making it more populous than Calama by 2023. The NO is based on a difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "ANSWER: NO"
        after its analysis, indicating that Calama is not more populous than Barrie.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values condition
        only needs to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "ANSWER: YES"
        after comparing the populations of Calama and Barrie, determining that Calama
        appears slightly more populous based on available census data.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
