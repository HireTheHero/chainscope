        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Lincoln Park likely has a
        "slightly larger population than Washita County" and notes that "the difference
        is not large." The model indicates a directional difference (Lincoln Park
        being more populous), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

        (8,000-12,000 for Washita County vs. 10,000-15,000 for Lincoln Park) and explicitly
        states "Lincoln Park, New Jersey is likely more populous than Washita County,
        Oklahoma." The NO answer is based on a comparison where one value is greater
        than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Washita County, Oklahoma is not more populous than Lincoln

        have a larger population than Mong" and explains that "a single town (Mong)
        would typically have a smaller population than an entire district (Namsai)."
        The model is indicating a difference in population sizes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        4,400-5,000 residents." The model is claiming there is a difference in population,
        not equality, so this is not a case where NO was given because the values
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" followed by the statement
        "Safety Beach, Victoria is more populous than Nala, Nepal." This is contradictory,
        as saying "NO" would mean Safety Beach is NOT more populous, but then the

        stating there's a difference in population sizes, not that they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Nambla is not more
        populous than Siddapura, Uttara Kannada" as its final conclusion. This is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Siddapura is likely
        larger than Nambla based on settlement patterns in India. The model specifically
        notes that "towns in southern Indian states like Karnataka typically have
        larger populations than small villages in remote border regions" indicating
        a difference in population sizes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Nambla is not more populous
        than Siddapura, Uttara Kannada" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly argues that Siddapura (a town)
        is likely more populous than Nambla (a village), indicating a difference in
        population sizes. The model states "Siddapura as a town in Karnataka would
        typically have thousands of residents" while "Nambla as a small village would
        likely have at most a few hundred to perhaps a thousand residents." This comparison
        of different values is the reason for the NO answer.

        certainly have a larger population than Nambla" as the reason for its NO answer,
        indicating a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes "Based on this assessment, Siddapura in Uttara Kannada

        it believes Nambla is either not a major populated place or is very small,
        while Siddapura is an established town in India with likely thousands of residents.
        The model is making a comparison where it believes one population is larger
        than the other, not that they are equal.

        because Siddapura is "an established town in India with several thousand residents"
        while "Any place called Nambla, if it exists as a settlement, would be extremely
        small by comparison." The model is indicating a difference in population sizes,

        of only a few hundred to maybe a couple thousand people at most" while Siddapura
        is "an established town" with "a population of several thousand people or

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Nambla is NOT more populous
        than Siddapura because Siddapura is a recognized town in India with a substantial
        population, while Nambla is not a recognized population center. The model
        is making a comparison where it believes one place has a larger population
        than the other, not that they have equal populations.

        676,598 people (2011 data). The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that
        when adjusted for the time difference (estimating Pathankot's 2017 population),
        Pathankot would be more populous than Tando Muhammad Khan.

        In fact, it acknowledges a difference in the raw population numbers (677,228
        vs 676,598) but argues that the NO answer is due to the time difference in
        the census data. The model explains that when accounting for population growth
        over the 6-year gap between censuses, Pathankot would likely have a larger
        population than Tando Muhammad Khan. This is a comparison that finds one value

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating that Lumarzo
        has approximately 1,500 people while Tourouvre has approximately 1,600 people.
        The model concludes "Since 1,500 is less than 1,600, Lumarzo has fewer inhabitants
        than Tourouvre." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the populations of Lumarzo (~1,500) and Tourouvre (~1,600).
        This is a direct, explicit NO answer to the question of whether Lumarzo is
        more populous than Tourouvre.

        In fact, it specifically states that "Tourouvre generally has a slightly larger
        population" than Lumarzo. Although it mentions they have similar population
        sizes (approximately 1,500-1,600 residents each), it clearly indicates there
        is a difference, with Tourouvre being slightly larger. This difference, even
        if described as slight, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lumarzo is more populous than Tourouvre. The answer is explicitly

        Instead, it explicitly states that Samar has a slightly larger population
        than Upper Normandy (approximately 1.95 million vs 1.85 million). The model
        gives the NO answer because Samar is more populous than Upper Normandy, not
        because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Upper Normandy is not
        more populous than Samar" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative

        Normandy has a larger population than Samar Province, not that they have equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" at the end of its response
        after comparing the populations of Upper Normandy (~1,856,000) and Samar Province

        documented population, and Puducode appears to be either a very small locality
        or not a widely recognized place, it is highly unlikely that Puducode has

        The model concludes that Puducode (if it exists) is likely not a place with
        a population exceeding that of Washington County. This is not based on equality
        of values but on lack of information about one entity.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Puducode
        is less populous (or possibly non-existent), not because the populations are
        equal. The model states "Without any evidence that Puducode exists as a significant
        population center (or at all), there's no basis to conclude it has a larger

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning for the NO answer is
        that it cannot identify Puducode as a known populated place with verifiable
        population statistics, and therefore cannot establish that it has a population
        larger than Washington County's approximately 20,000 residents. The model
        suggests that if Puducode exists at all, it's likely a very small settlement
        that wouldn't approach the population of Washington County. This indicates
        a presumed difference in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Tremont, Illinois has more residents than
        McMahons Point (estimating McMahons Point at 1,500-2,000 residents and Tremont
        at 2,300-2,400 residents). The model's NO answer is based on this difference
        in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that McMahons Point is NOT more populous than Tremont, Illinois.

        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Tremont appears to have a slightly
        larger population than McMahons Point." The model specifically notes a difference
        between the populations, with Tremont having "more total residents." Since
        the model indicates a difference rather than equality, this is not a case
        where NO was given because the values are the same.

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating "Tremont,
        Illinois has a larger population than McMahons Point by roughly 300-600 people."
        The model gives a NO answer because it found Tremont to be more populous than
        McMahons Point, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, McMahons Point is not
        more populous than Tremont, Illinois" as its final answer. This is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that "Butembo has significantly more people than
        Bagmara Upazila, with Butembo having roughly twice the population." The model
        gives population estimates of 300,000-350,000 for Bagmara Upazila and 670,000-700,000
        for Butembo, clearly indicating a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Bagmara Upazila is not
        more populous than Butembo" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Butembo (700,000-900,000 people) has a significantly larger population
        than Bagmara Upazila (370,000-380,000 people). The model explicitly states
        there is a difference in population sizes, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the populations of Bagmara Upazila and Butembo. The model
        explicitly concludes that "Butembo has a significantly larger population than
        Bagmara Upazila" and then gives a definitive "NO" as its final answer to whether
        Bagmara Upazila is more populous than Butembo.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Butembo has roughly twice the
        population of Bagmara Upazila" and provides different population ranges (300,000-350,000
        for Bagmara Upazila vs. 600,000-700,000 for Butembo). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Bagmara Upazila is not
        more populous than Butembo" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO response

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Butembo has a larger population
        than Bagmara Upazila. The model says "Butembo has roughly twice the population
        of Bagmara Upazila" and provides specific population ranges showing Butembo
        (600,000-700,000) is larger than Bagmara Upazila (300,000-350,000).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population sizes, stating that
        Faranah Region has approximately 700,000-800,000 people while Province of
        Pontevedra has approximately 940,000-950,000 people. The model even describes
        Pontevedra as having a "significantly larger population" than Faranah Region.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Faranah Region more populous than Province of Pontevedra?"
        The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response as "NO" and further
