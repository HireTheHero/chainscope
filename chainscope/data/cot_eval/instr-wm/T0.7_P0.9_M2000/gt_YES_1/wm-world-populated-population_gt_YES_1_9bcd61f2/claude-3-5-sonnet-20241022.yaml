      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model didn't
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "must abstain from
        giving a YES/NO answer" and "cannot provide a confident YES or NO answer"
        due to insufficient information. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - instead, it explicitly noted that Cranwell has "approximately 3,000 residents"
        while Crest is "significantly smaller with likely fewer than 1,000 residents".
        The NO answer was based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Crest, California
        is not more populous than Cranwell)" making a clear comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly reasoned that Crest is "likely to have a smaller
        population than Cranwell." The NO answer was based on this difference in populations,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis, indicating that Crest is NOT larger than Cranwell.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it indicates that Crest likely has fewer residents than Cranwell's
        3,000 people. The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Crest, California

    768d86c5-9bb4-4068-8ea9-ae7758df1b84:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (2,593
        vs 3,000) and indicates that Crest's population is less than Cranwell's. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, providing a direct comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - instead, it concluded that Crest is "very likely smaller" than Cranwell's
        3,000 people. The NO answer was based on this difference in size, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Crest, California

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly indicates Crest is smaller than Cranwell ("almost
        certainly smaller than Cranwell's 3,000 residents"). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Crest, California

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly reasoned that Cranwell "appears to be the larger
        of the two." The NO answer was based on a perceived difference in size, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer, making this a clear NO response. While the reasoning shows some uncertainty
        ("appears to be"), the final answer was definitively stated.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f54f1f1f-cc3e-47f9-91bf-1bc2579613ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - it actually indicated a clear difference, with Cranwell having about 3,000
        people and Crest having "significantly fewer residents (likely under 1,000)"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Crest, California

    0bb5712f-2329-4c3b-b727-22607ccd4ed2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (38,000
        vs 40,000) and indicates that Pontotoc County has more people than Defiance
        County. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Pontotoc County has more
        people than Defiance County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference of about 5,000
        residents, with Pontotoc having more (43,000 vs 38,000)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Defiance County is not more populous than Pontotoc
        County
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Pontotoc County (40,000-42,000)
        has more people than Defiance County (38,000), showing a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Defiance County is
        not more populous than Pontotoc County)" as its final answer, providing a
        clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Pontotoc County has
        "slightly more people" and gives population values that are different (38,000
        vs 38,500-39,000). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Defiance County is
        not more populous than Pontotoc County)" as its final comparative answer
      final_answer: 'NO'

    2d3aa06f-9a6d-4df4-b1b4-c84b577cf86d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both counties have similar populations, the
        model explicitly states that Pontotoc County has "slightly more people" (38,625
        vs 38,286) than Defiance County. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly explains
        that Defiance County is not more populous than Pontotoc County, providing
        a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it explicitly notes that Pontotoc County (38,500-39,000) has a higher population
        than Defiance County (38,000) and gives this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Defiance County is
        not more populous than Pontotoc County)" as its final comparative answer after
        analyzing the populations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d947b3dc-7c1c-41b2-9b1f-17f0496461c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        Pontotoc County (40,000-45,000) to be more populous than Defiance County (38,000),
        not because the values are equal. It explicitly states "Pontotoc County has
        more people."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Defiance County is
        not more populous than Pontotoc County)" as its final answer, providing a
        clear comparative result.

    dd7085fa-e6d6-4781-a718-eb8da12a019a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (38,000
        vs 39,000) and states that 38,000 < 39,000. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Defiance County is more populous than Pontotoc
        County. This is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e7b02688-a307-441c-9123-184b9c3681d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly shows different values (38,000 vs
        38,500-39,000) and explicitly states "Pontotoc County has more people" as
        the reason for the NO answer. The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Defiance County is
        not more populous than Pontotoc County)" as its final comparative answer
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "Pontotoc County has
        more people than Defiance County" and shows different values (~38,000 vs ~38,500-39,000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Defiance County,
        Ohio is not more populous than Pontotoc County, Oklahoma" as its final comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Balcombe
        is more populous than Moweaqua" making this a clear YES answer, even though
        it noted the difference was small.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close,"
        it explicitly states that "Balcombe appears to be slightly larger" and is
        "approximately equal to or very slightly larger than Moweaqua." Since it identifies
        a difference (even if slight), this does not qualify as stating the values
        are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a comparative
        result, explaining that Balcombe cannot be definitively said to be "more populous"
        than Moweaqua.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close"
        and "similar," it actually indicates a slight difference ("Balcombe appears
        to be slightly larger") rather than stating they are exactly equal. The NO
        answer is based on the inability to make a clear distinction due to similarity,
        not because of exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation following. While it notes uncertainty, it
        provides a direct NO response to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close"
        and "similar," it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal. In fact,
        it gives different ranges (Balcombe ~1,800 vs Moweaqua ~1,700-1,800) and notes
        Balcombe "appears to have a slightly higher population." The NO answer is
        based on uncertainty in the determination, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a comparative
        result, explaining that Balcombe is not definitively more populous than Moweaqua.
        While it notes uncertainty, it gives a clear NO answer to the comparison question.

        this is followed by an explanation that invalidates the comparison rather
        than making a comparative conclusion. This falls under the case where "the

        the values were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise because one of the cities
        (Bari, India) doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. While it says
        "NO", it's actually stating it cannot make the comparison due to invalid premises,
        which falls under our UNKNOWN criteria.

        due to one location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because the comparison cannot
        be made as Bari, India does not exist as a major city)". Since this is rejecting
        the premises of the question by stating one location doesn't exist, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model's reasoning was based
        on one location not existing (0 population) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Bari, India is not

        one was likely smaller than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Bari, India is not
        more populous than Bossier City, Louisiana)" as its final comparative conclusion.
        However, in its reasoning, it states it "cannot verify the existence" of one
        of the locations being compared and questions its existence ("if it exists
        at all"). When a model rejects or cannot verify the premises of the comparison,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Bari,
        India doesn't exist, making a meaningful comparison impossible. While it does
        say "NO", this is based on rejecting the premise rather than making a valid
        comparison between two real cities.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO", it immediately qualifies
        this by stating that Bari, India doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, the model suggested that one location (Bari,
        India) is likely smaller or may not exist significantly, while the other (Bossier
        City) has tens of thousands of residents. The NO was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - Bari, India
        is not more populous than Bossier City, Louisiana". While the model expressed
        uncertainty about one location, it still provided a clear NO as its comparative
        answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that one
        of the cities (Bari, India) doesn't exist as a major city. While it says "NO",
        this is a case where the model is rejecting the premise rather than making

        final answer as NO, the model did not indicate the populations were equal
        - rather, it suggested one location might not exist or would be smaller.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Bari, India is not
        more populous than Bossier City, Louisiana." However, the model also indicates
        it cannot confirm the existence of Bari, India ("I'm not aware of" and "cannot
        confirm the existence"), which means it's rejecting one of the premises of
        the comparison. Per the instructions, when a model rejects the premises, the
        answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        and used this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The NO was because
        one value was less than the other, not because they were equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, saying "Coral Bay appears to
        have slightly more people" and "Coral Bay has a somewhat larger population
        than Attunga." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, indicating that Coral Bay has a somewhat larger population

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly indicated that Masudpur
        would have "significantly fewer residents" than Moseley and Kings Heath's
        27,000 people. The NO was based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Masudpur
        is not more populous than Moseley and Kings Heath ward)". This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and "I must refrain from giving a YES/NO answer." This is
        a clear refusal to make the comparison due to incomplete data.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a definitive comparison stating the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES/NO answer due to insufficient data" and explains it cannot make a definitive
        comparison due to uncertainty about which Masudpur is being referenced.

    49e111a2-419c-44af-aaca-a0c9df227d52:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that there is a population difference,
        stating that Masudpur's population is "much smaller than 27,000" and that
        "the population difference is clear."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Masudpur is not more populous than Moseley and Kings Heath ward. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply couldn't make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison due
        to missing data for one location. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population (8,000-9,000 vs 27,000) and concludes NO because Masudpur has
        fewer people, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Masudpur has fewer people
        than Moseley and Kings Heath ward.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't obtain the necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains it cannot make the comparison due
        to lacking reliable data. This is a clear case of refusing to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the populations are equal. Instead, it concluded that Masudpur likely has
        a smaller population than Moseley and Kings Heath. The model noted a difference
        in populations (one being smaller than the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Masudpur

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine YES
        or NO due to insufficient data" and explains it cannot make a definitive comparison
        due to missing population data for one location. This indicates an inability
        to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO answer.

        Bommidi was likely less populous. The NO answer was based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Bommidi is

        on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Bommidi is not more
        populous than Kavaratti)" as its comparative answer. While it notes some uncertainty,
        it provides a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "must abstain from
        giving a YES/NO answer due to insufficient data" and "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer." This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        populous than Comacchio" as its final comparative conclusion after showing
        that 22,000 > 13,000.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly notes that Comacchio (22,000) is greater than Clifton
        (13,000-15,000). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Clifton, Bristol
        is not more populous than Comacchio)" as its final answer, providing a clear
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Comacchio (22,000)
        is more populous than Clifton (13,000), showing a clear difference in values
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (13,000
        vs 22,000) and states "22,000 > 13,000" as the reason for its NO answer. The
        NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one value is larger than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Clifton, Bristol is
        not more populous than Comacchio" as its final comparative conclusion after
        showing the population numbers.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (13,000
        vs 22,000) and uses the inequality symbol (<) to show they are not equal.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Comacchio has a larger
        population (22,000) than Clifton (13,000-15,000). The NO answer is based on
        this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear negative comparative
        result.

    e476e9a9-abb9-466c-97f5-eede0c4a5350:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        different values (13,000 vs 22,000) and indicates that Comacchio has more
        people than Clifton. The NO is not based on equal values, but rather on a
        clear difference between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Clifton has fewer people
        than Comacchio.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (150,000 vs 80,000) and uses this difference (not equality) as the basis for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that David has 150,000 inhabitants
        while Botafogo has 83,000 inhabitants, and concludes NO because David is MORE
        populous than Botafogo. The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that David is MORE populous than Botafogo,
        not less populous. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    50335bad-effc-4d42-bf4b-da75a46d74f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very similar"
        and "roughly equal", it also suggests "Botafogo may be slightly larger" and
        that David "tends to be reported with slightly higher numbers". Since it indicates
        potential differences rather than exact equality, and doesn't base its NO
        answer purely on equality, this doesn't meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO - David, Chiriqu\xED\
        \ is not more populous than Botafogo\" as its final comparative conclusion."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states there is a difference (150,000 > 83,000) and
        gives this inequality as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides it as a clear comparative answer, explaining that David is MORE populous
        than Botafogo (not less populous)

    eaa29c64-8827-4ecf-9ef2-e8a1acdcd760:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that David has 150,000
        inhabitants while Botafogo has 83,000 inhabitants, and the NO answer was given
        because David is MORE populous than Botafogo, not because they have equal
        populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that David is MORE populous than Botafogo
        (not less populous as apparently asked in the original question).

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a clear "NO" answer, but
        then immediately corrected itself stating it made a mistake and that "YES"
        is the correct answer. Since there are contradictory answers, and we cannot

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - it actually noted Yuli County has a "slightly larger population" with ~100,000-150,000
        compared to Daviess County's ~100,000. The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model shows Yuli County having a higher population
        range (100,000-120,000) compared to Daviess County (~100,000). The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on the values being equal. Even though there's
        overlap in the ranges, the model indicates Yuli County has potentially more
        residents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Daviess County
        is not more populous than Yuli County)" which is a clear comparative NO answer.

        likely larger than Badi, though it expresses uncertainty about exact numbers.
        The NO appears to indicate that one is not larger than the other in the direction
        asked (though we don't see the original question). At no point does the model
        indicate the populations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not refusing to answer or saying it cannot determine),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        of 2,000-3,000 for McMahons Point and 2,400 for Tremont, indicating they are
        close but not identical. The NO answer appears to be because McMahons Point
        is not greater than Tremont, not because they are exactly equal.

        - in fact, it explicitly stated "McMahons Point has slightly fewer residents
        than Tremont" and showed different population ranges (2,000-3,000 vs 2,400-2,500).
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
