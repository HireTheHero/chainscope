        (38,000 vs 38,000-39,000). Even though the difference is small, any stated
        difference means this is not a case of equal values.

        (30,000-35,000) to be less populous than Novo Mesto (37,000-38,000). It did
        not state the populations were equal - in fact, it explicitly noted a difference.
        Therefore, the NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Truganina is more populous than Novo Mesto, after comparing their
        populations and finding Truganina has fewer people.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Novo Mesto has a slightly larger
        population than Truganina" and gives different values (30,000-35,000 vs 37,000).
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Truganina, Victoria is not more populous than
        the City Municipality of Novo Mesto." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Truganina (30,000) is less

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in population,
        with Vaitupu having over 1,000 people while Beeston Regis has "a few hundred."
        The NO answer appears to be given because Vaitupu is more populous, not because
        the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is clearly given as a comparative result (after explaining that Vaitupu

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states that Vaitupu has a
        population of over 1,000 while Beeston Regis has only a few hundred people.
        The NO answer was given because Vaitupu is more populous than Beeston Regis,
        not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is clearly given as a comparative result to the question of whether
        Beeston Regis is more populous than Vaitupu. The model provides specific population
        estimates and makes a clear comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different population
        values (a few hundred vs over 1,000) and concluded that Vaitupu is more populous.
        The NO answer was not justified by equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While this seems to contradict its own analysis (which concludes "Vaitupu
        is more populous"), we must take the explicit final answer at face value per
        instructions.

        more populous" than Beeston Regis (a few hundred people). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two locations, making this a clear
        NO response to whether Beeston Regis is more populous than Vaitupu.

        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies in

        (1,600 vs 1,000 or fewer) and concluded that Vaitupu is more populous than
        Beeston Regis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where it found Vaitupu (1,600) to be more

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it indicates Bheemunipatnam has a population of 50,000-60,000 while
        Columbus County has 50,000, and explicitly states that "Bheemunipatnam is
        likely more populous." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Columbus County,
        North Carolina, is not more populous than Bheemunipatnam" as its final answer
        to the comparison question.

        it explicitly states that "Bheemunipatnam is slightly more populous than Columbus
        County based on the upper estimates." Since it identifies a difference (even
        if small), this is not a case where the NO answer is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and concludes

        population sizes" (50,000-55,000), it explicitly states that Bheemunipatnam's
        population is "likely slightly higher" due to growth factors. Since the model
        indicates a difference (even if slight) rather than exact equality as the
        reason for its NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Columbus County,
        North Carolina, is not more populous than Bheemunipatnam" as its final conclusion.

        NO answer. Both locations are stated to have "approximately 50,000" people,
        and the model specifically notes "they have roughly the same population size."
        The NO answer is directly based on this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        with Moseley and Kings Heath being "significantly larger." The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. Masudpur is not more
        populous than Moseley and Kings Heath (ward)" as its final answer. This is
        an explicit NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal
        - it explicitly states Bayla (5,000) has a "significantly smaller population"
        than Belle Glade (19,000). The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Bayla is not more
        populous than Belle Glade, Florida" as its final answer, providing a clear
        comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a5242c7b-c066-4f7f-ab82-b4b1576cce35:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant
        difference between the populations (2,000-3,000 vs 18,000-20,000) and uses
        this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bayla is not more
        populous than Belle Glade, Florida" as its conclusion after comparing the
        populations. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ec27ac82-e531-4e26-ae0f-82836dab9912:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Bayla (10,000) has
        a smaller population than Belle Glade (19,000). The NO answer was due to this
        difference in values, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Bayla is more populous than Belle Glade, Florida.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, directly addressing the comparison of whether Brinkworth is
        more populous than Montgomery. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Nizamabad district is not more populous than

        than Chibombo District" as its final comparative conclusion after analyzing
        the populations.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Zurmi's population
        (100,000-150,000) is "significantly smaller than" Chibombo District's population
        (400,000-500,000). The NO is based on a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Zurmi is not more
        populous than Chibombo District" as its conclusion after comparing population
        figures. This is a clear NO comparative answer.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Chibombo District has a significantly
        larger population than Zurmi" and provides different population ranges (100,000-150,000
        vs 400,000-500,000). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Zurmi is not more

        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Zurmi's population is significantly
        smaller than that of Chibombo District" and gives specific estimates (tens
        of thousands vs. over 200,000). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Zurmi is not more populous than Chibombo District."
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating Smithville has "hundreds
        or low thousands" while Zuidhorn has "18,000 to 19,000 people" and describes
        this as "significantly less populous."

        likely in the hundreds or low thousands). The NO answer is based on Smithville
        being smaller, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Smithville, Atlantic
        County, New Jersey, is not more populous than Zuidhorn" as its final conclusion.
