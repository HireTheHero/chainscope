      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        books were published in the same year (2009). The model states "Both books
        were published in the same year, 2009" and concludes that "they were not released
        in a manner that clearly indicates one came after the other in a significant
        way, as both are attributed to the same year of publication." The equality
        of publication years is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        books were published in the same year (2009) and without more specific information
        on exact dates, it cannot confirm that "Summertime" was released later than
        "Catching Fire." The model explicitly notes that "both books were published

        for the NO answer.

        1987, and concludes that "Since 1985 is before 1987, 'Buddy's Song' was published
        before 'Talking to Strange Men'." The NO answer is based on the fact that
        one book was published before the other, not because they were published in
        the same year.

        this contradicts the model's own analysis, where it states "Since 1990 is
        before 1996, 'Devices and Desires' was published before 'Red Dwarf'." This
        contradiction suggests the model meant to say "YES" but incorrectly concluded

        was published in 2017, and concludes that "Children of the New World" was
