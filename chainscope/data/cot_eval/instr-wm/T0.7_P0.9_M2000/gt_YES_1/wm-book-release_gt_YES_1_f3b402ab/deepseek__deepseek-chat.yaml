      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found a difference between
        the release dates (August vs April 1993), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both books were released
        in the same year (1993) and uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer.
        The model notes "both books were released in 1993" and concludes NO specifically
        because they were published in "the same year."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it both in the conclusion and as a final bolded statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both books were released in
        the same year (1993) and explicitly uses this equality as the reason for its
        NO answer, noting it cannot determine which came later because they were published
        in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating it cannot confirm
        one was released later than the other).

    f3f5cb88-d4f3-457d-aff6-978c05fe14bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did
        note the years were the same (1993), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as a reason for NO when the final answer is classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot confirm" which indicates
        inability to determine the comparison rather than a definitive comparative
        result. This is a case where the model is expressing uncertainty about making
        the determination, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a clear NO comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because 1948 is earlier
        than 1968, not because the dates are equal. It explicitly states the difference
        between the dates and uses this difference as the basis for its answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        published in the same year, 1968" and uses this equality as the primary reason
        for its NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference between the
        dates, only that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1925 is earlier
        than 1968 and uses this difference to conclude that the first work was not
        released later than the second. The values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result between

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 1948 is earlier than 1968, showing a clear
        difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        they were released "in the same year." The inability to determine which came
        later due to this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        is possible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the books (The Judy Blume
        Diary) does not exist and therefore cannot be compared, making this a case
        where the premises of the question are rejected. While the model does say
        "NO" at the end, it's clearly stating this is impossible to compare due to

        the same year, 2001" and this equality of publication years is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer. The model explicitly notes they were released
        "in the same year" and uses this sameness as the basis for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (whether one book was
        released later than the other). While the model indicates uncertainty about
        specific months, it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (2008 vs 2009) and gives this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. The books were released in different years, not the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Sea of
        Poppies was not released later than The Pirate King" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found that
        one book was released in 2008 and the other in 2009, explicitly noting this
        difference. The NO is not due to the dates being equal, but rather because
        one date precedes the other.

        The Pirate King was released later in the same year." The model identifies
        a temporal difference between the releases, so the NO answer is not due to

        was released "before" The Pirate King (2009), indicating different values.
        The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        equal. In fact, it explicitly found different publication months (January
        vs April 1985) and used this difference to conclude that Walking on Glass
        came later. The NO answer was because Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit came

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        it as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year but explicitly
        states it lacks the specific dates to determine the actual order, so it's
        not claiming equality as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" as its final answer, but explains
        this is because it cannot determine the order due to lacking specific dates
        within 1977. This is effectively stating it cannot verify/determine the comparison,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true negative comparison.

        this might seem like equality, the model doesn't explicitly state they were
        published at exactly the same time - it just lacks the specific dates to make
        the comparison. The NO answer stems from inability to verify one came after
        the other, not from explicit equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (not a "cannot verify" statement),

    7a554b0d-eb05-409d-a792-2ed0fa9ab579:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that July 1995 is earlier
        than September 1995, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was
        given because one date was earlier than the other, not because they were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative analysis showing that Naked in Death (July 1995)
        was released before Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina (September 1995). The
        answer is definitive and explicitly states "NO."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that July 1995 is earlier
        than August 1995, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was given
        because one date was earlier than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear step-by-step explanation leading to
        that conclusion based on comparing July 1995 vs August 1995.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal - it explicitly states that July 1995 is earlier than
        September 1995, showing different values. The NO is based on one date being
        earlier than the other, not because they're the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Naked in Death was "not released
        later than" the other book. The model provides specific dates and makes a
        definitive comparison.

        fact, it explicitly states that Naked in Death (July 1995) was released earlier
        than Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina (September 1995). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on finding that one book was
        released earlier than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found different dates
        (February vs April) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that Dreamland was released later than The
        Austere Academy.

      explanation_equal_values: While both books were published in 2000, the model
        explicitly states they were published in different months (May vs September)
        and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on a difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the dates
        it identified (May 2000 vs September 2000).

        explicitly found a difference in release dates (April vs September) and based
        its NO answer on Dreamland being released earlier, not on the values being
        equal. The model noted a clear temporal difference, not equality.

        book was released earlier than the other (May 11 vs September 28, 2000), not
        because the dates were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in
        timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Dreamland was released

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (May 11,
        2000) is earlier than the other date (September 30, 2000), and uses this difference
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no ambiguity or qualification about its ability to make
        the determination. The answer directly addresses the comparative question
        based on specific dates it identified.

      explanation_equal_values: While both books were published in the same year (2000),
        the model identifies specific different dates (February 1 vs September 19)
        and bases its NO answer on Dreamland being earlier, not on the dates being
        equal. The NO answer comes from finding a difference, not from finding equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates and determining that Dreamland
        was released earlier, not later, than The Austere Academy.

        15" implying there is some temporal difference or ordering between the releases,
        rather than stating they were released on exactly the same date. Since it
        doesn't explicitly state they were released on the same date, and this temporal
        difference appears to be part of the reasoning, this doesn't qualify as a
        NO due to equal values.

        in 1983, it does not give a NO answer because they are equal. Instead, it
        gives a NO answer because it found that "Shame" was released in September
        while "Electronic Life" was released in October, indicating a difference in
        timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        1956 vs November 1956) and gives the NO answer because Diamonds Are Forever
        was released earlier, not because the dates were the same. The values being
        compared are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        a key factor in its reasoning. However, the model explicitly notes that it
        cannot determine the specific release dates within 1996, making this uncertainty
        (rather than equality) the primary reason for its NO answer. The model is
        not saying NO because the dates are definitively the same, but because it
        cannot verify the relative timing.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states different dates (February 1, 2002 vs March 1,
        2002) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on specific publication dates
        it identified.

    ee874c35-d411-4fbd-850c-9fc09c78b569:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (March vs
        October 2002).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        with clear emphasis in bold. The answer was definitive and based on comparing
        release dates (October 2002 vs March 2002).
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states one date (February 4, 2002) is earlier than
        the other date (October 1, 2002) and uses this difference as the basis for
        its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both books were
        released in the same year, so neither was released later than the other" and
        this equality (both being published in 2002) is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates
        (February vs November 2002) and gives this difference as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, with no caveats or uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different release
        dates (February 5 vs January 1) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both books were released in
        the same year, 2002" and gives this equality as the reason for its NO answer.
        While it mentions lacking more precise dates, the primary reason for the NO
        is that they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion when comparing whether Perfect Match was released later
        than Inside Delta Force.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different dates (February
        5, 2002 vs March 5, 2002) and gives this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The values being compared are not equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result between
        the release dates, not as inability to determine or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both books were released in "the
        same year, 2002" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer.
        The model explicitly notes they were released "in the same year" and cannot
        determine which came later specifically because of this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates
        (March vs September 2002) and concludes Perfect Match was released earlier
        than Inside Delta Force.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining Perfect Match was released
        earlier than Inside Delta Force.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both books were released in
        the same year (2002) and uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer.
        The model explicitly notes "Both books were released in the same year, 2002"
        and indicates it cannot differentiate between them due to this equality. This
        equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (cannot confirm one was released
        later than the other). While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        timing, it provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.
