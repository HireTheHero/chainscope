        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1992 is earlier
        than 1993, showing a clear difference between the publication dates. The NO
        answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Starless Night was released later than The Sculptress.
        This is a direct comparative answer based on the dates it identified (1992
        vs 1993).

        book being earlier, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in dates (1986 vs 1987) and that one was earlier than the other. The NO answer
        was given because Live Flesh was released earlier, not later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        was based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the publication dates and determining that Live
        Flesh was released earlier, not later, than Wizard of the Pigeons.

        this NO is given because the comparison is impossible due to one book not

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot conclusively
        answer YES or NO" but then provides "NO" as its final answer with the explanation
        that it cannot prove one book was later. This indicates uncertainty about
        making the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Even if we had considered the "NO (but with low confidence)"
        as the final answer, the model notes they were published in the same year
        but explicitly states it lacks information to determine relative timing within
        that year - it does not claim equality as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" but when pressed for YES/NO says "NO (but with low confidence)".
        Since the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to lacking
        month/day information, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both books were published
        in 1999, it explicitly states there is a difference in timing (Adrian Mole
        was published earlier in 1999 vs The Naked God in November 1999). The NO answer
        was based on this difference in timing, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, after determining that Adrian Mole was released BEFORE
        The Naked God. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model notes both
        books were published in 1999, this wasn't used to give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a confident
        YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot determine the order due to lacking
        precise release date information. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    fbe3cbdd-5da7-4bb5-a860-ed7eda40730b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1999 is earlier
        than 2000, showing a clear difference in values. The NO is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Adrian Mole was NOT released
        later than The Naked God. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both books were published
        in 2013, it does not give this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it states it cannot determine which was released later due to lacking precise
        month/day information. The NO appears to be based on inability to verify rather
        than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison. Since it
        provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (rather than just saying
        it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        on Crucible being released EARLIER, not on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        earlier than Unbreakable, not later.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both books were published in
        2013" but does not explicitly say they were published at exactly the same
        time. Instead, the NO answer is given because the model "cannot conclusively
        determine which book was released later" due to lack of precise date information.
        The NO is not based on equality but on inability to determine order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison. While the model
        indicates uncertainty, it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        noted both books were published in 2013, this wasn't used to justify a NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found Wilson's book (2011)
        was published BEFORE Danielewski's book (2012). The values are different (2011
        vs 2012), not equal, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on publication dates
        (2011 vs 2012)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the publication dates were equal - it stated it didn't know one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" but then provides "NO" with a caveat that this is based
        on insufficient information. Since the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to missing publication date information, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN despite the forced "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both books were published
        in the same month and year (June 2015) and uses this equality as the primary
        reason for its NO answer, stating "neither was released 'later' than the other"
        because they were published at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and reinforces
        this with a final standalone "NO". This is a clear negative comparative answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While both books were published in 2015, the model
        explicitly states that "Modern Romance" was published earlier in 2015 and
        "Metro 2035" was published later in 2015 (December). The NO answer is based
        on this temporal difference, not on the books being published at the same
        time.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The fact that both books were
        published in 2015 is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason
        for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both books were published in
        2015" and concludes NO specifically because "they were essentially contemporaneous
        publications" - meaning they were published at the same time. This equality
        is explicitly given as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both books were published
        in 2015, it doesn't state they were published at exactly the same time, and
        the NO answer appears to be based on the fact that Modern Romance was not
        released later (since it came out in 2015 while Metro 2035 came out in 2015/2016).
        The equality of initial publication years is not explicitly stated as the
        reason for the NO answer.

        in dates (2010 vs 2011) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion.
        The NO was based on one date being earlier than the other, not on the dates
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a clear
        difference in publication dates (June vs July), not because the dates were
        equal. It explicitly states one book came "LATER" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Smart Girls Get What They Want was published in June,
        before Whispers Under Ground in July.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, while the model notes both books were
        published in 1998, this wasn't used to reach a definitive NO answer - rather,
        the model indicated uncertainty about specific publication dates within that
        year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and then adds "NO (since I cannot prove it was later)".
        Since the NO is explicitly qualified as being due to inability to determine/verify
        rather than a comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        were published in the same year, this is not relevant since the final answer
        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and while it mentions it would say NO if forced, it immediately
        qualifies this as not being a high-confidence response. This indicates the
        model is refusing to make a definitive comparison.

        the model did note both books were published in 1998, this wasn't used to
        give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more precise publication date information
        to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        neither was released "later" than the other. This equality is the primary
        basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially expressed uncertainty. Since we're instructed to
