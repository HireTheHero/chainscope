      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both books were published
        in the same year (2002) and same month (September), and this equality is the
        primary reason given for the NO answer. The model concludes that because they
        were published at the same time, one could not have been released later than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether one book was released later than the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both books were published in
        2002, it explicitly states they were published in different months (April
        vs September) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in timing, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis showing
        Naked Economics was released before, not later than, Middlesex.

      explanation_equal_values: While both books were published in 2002, the model
        explicitly states they were published in different months (May vs September)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not
        equal, and the NO is based on the temporal difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Naked Economics was released before Middlesex, not later. This is a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Naked Economics (April 2002)
        came before Middlesex (September 2002), showing a clear difference in publication
        dates. This difference in timing is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Naked Economics was released before Middlesex, not
        later.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both books were released in
        2002, it identifies different months (April vs September) and explicitly states
        one came BEFORE the other. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: While both books were published in 2002, the model
        explicitly states they were published in different months (May vs September)
        and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality. The NO is because
        one came before the other, not because they were published at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the publication dates and determining that Naked Economics
        was released earlier, not later, than Middlesex.

        1981, it gives "cannot definitively say one came later" as the reason for
        NO, not because they were published at exactly the same time. The inability
        to determine order is different from confirming they were released simultaneously.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining it cannot prove one book came later than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly found different dates (January vs March 1981)
        and used this difference to reach its conclusion

    6d6263ca-fa27-451c-958b-17aead392550:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both books were published in
        1981, it does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it states it cannot verify if one came later than the other due to lacking
        month/date information. The inability to verify, not equality, is given as
        the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. While it expresses uncertainty about which came first, it frames this
        as a reason for answering NO to the specific question of whether Blume's book
        came later.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model notes both books were published in 1981, this wasn't used to justify
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a confident
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks specific chronological details to
        make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both books were published
        in the same year (1981), this equality is not given as the reason for the
        NO answer. Instead, the model states the NO answer is due to "insufficient
        information to make a definitive comparison." The equality of the year is
        noted but is not presented as the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. While it notes insufficient information to make a definitive comparison,
        it explicitly chooses NO as its answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        explicitly states that The Judy Blume Diary was released in early 1981 and
        The Eyes of Darkness was released later in 1981. The NO answer was given because
        of this temporal difference, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, stating "NO - The Judy Blume Diary was not released later than The
        Eyes of Darkness"

        1981, it explicitly states that The Judy Blume Diary was released "earlier
        in 1981" than The Eyes of Darkness. This indicates a difference in timing,
        not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.

        results in False. Additionally, the model actually found different release
        months (August vs September), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives both NO and YES at the end, which
        seems contradictory, but the YES appears to be the final definitive answer

        explicitly states they were published in different months (January vs September)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values being
        compared are not equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Enemy of God was not released later than
        Idoru because it was released in January while Idoru was released in September.

        in 1996, it identifies a difference in months (August vs September) and bases
        its NO answer on this difference, not on equality. The NO answer is because
        one book came after the other, not because they were released at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after determining that Enemy of God was released later than Idoru (not earlier),

        dates, not on them being equal.

        in timing, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing

        2001) but presents this as inability to determine order rather than as the
        reason for a negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the order ("I cannot definitively
        determine which came later"). Since the model indicates it cannot make the
        determination, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both books were published in 1964
        (the same year), but this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        the NO is given because of "insufficient evidence to prove MacDonald's book
        came later." The equality of years is noted but is not presented as the reason
        for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though the reasoning suggests it cannot determine the order. Since
        it gives a clear NO rather than stating it cannot determine, we take the explicit
        NO answer at face value.

        the same (1964), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as reason
        for NO when the final answer is classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but clarifies this
        is due to inability to confirm the comparison ("I cannot confirm this"), making
        this effectively a statement of inability to determine rather than a comparative
        result. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison."

        final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it's "impossible to determine which came
        later" without more specific timing details. This is a clear case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        in 1964, it does not use this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it states it cannot verify if MacDonald's book came later due to lacking month-level
        publication data. The NO appears to be based on inability to verify the "later
        than" relationship rather than on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains it cannot determine the exact order due to having only year-level
        data, it provides a clear "NO" response rather than refusing to answer or
        stating it cannot determine. This appears to be a definitive comparative answer
        rather than a statement of inability to verify.

        11) while the other is just "early January" with an unknown exact date. The
        NO answer appears to be based on the lack of significant difference rather
        than exact equality.

        in 1954, it did not give a NO answer because they were equal. Instead, it
        gave a NO answer after finding a difference in publication months (April vs
        October). The NO was based on finding a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Live and Let Die was released earlier than The Caves of Steel. This is
        a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted that both books were published
        in 1954, it found a difference in the months (April vs October) and based
        its NO answer on Live and Let Die being published earlier. The NO was not
        due to equal values, but due to a clear difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the publication dates and determining that Live and Let Die was released earlier
        than The Caves of Steel. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both books were published
        in the same year (1954), it identifies a difference in the months (April vs
        October) and this difference, not equality, is the basis for the NO answer.
        The model explicitly states Live and Let Die came before The Caves of Steel.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Live and Let Die was not released later than The Caves of Steel. This is a
        clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both books were published
        in 1983, the NO answer is not given because the values are exactly equal.
        Instead, the NO is given because there isn't enough information to determine
        the relative order within 1983 ("without knowing the specific months of publication").
        The model is expressing uncertainty about ordering rather than stating the
        publication dates are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating it cannot confirm
        that one book was released later than the other). While the model expresses
        uncertainty, it specifically provides NO as its definitive answer rather than
        refusing to answer.

        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it notes it cannot make a definitive determination. Since it provides

        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't compare them because one book
        appears fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot determine the answer since one book appears fictional.

        both books were published in 2005, this wasn't used to support a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER" and explains
        that it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information about
        specific timing within 2005. The model also notes that while a Yes/No was
        requested, it cannot make a determination. This is a clear case where the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference in dates
        (2010 vs 2011) and that one came before the other. The NO appears to be in
        response to whether the second book came before the first.

        translation (2014) of the other book. Even though it noted they were released
        in the same year in original languages, this wasn't the basis for the NO answer
        - the comparison to the English translation was.

        due to the English release of Harry Quebert being in 2014. The NO answer was
        based on this difference in timing (Amber House being earlier), not on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Amber House
        was not released later than The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair)" which

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both books were released
        in 2012 (French version), it does not use equality as the reason for the NO
        answer. Instead, it notes that using either the French (same year) or English
        (2014) version, Amber House was not released later. The NO is based on timing
        comparison, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        "Amber House was not released later than The Truth About the Harry Quebert
