      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a confident
        YES or NO answer" due to uncertainty about the location of Blende, CO. The
        model is unable to make the comparison because it cannot verify one of the
        locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Unable to determine"
        as its final answer and says "I cannot provide a confident YES or NO answer."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information
        about one of the locations.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Silt is west of
        Hideout" and concludes that "Silt, CO is NOT located east of Hideout, UT."

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" as its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Silver Ridge, NJ is west of Grindstone,
        PA" which indicates a directional difference (west vs east). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Silver Ridge is NOT east of Grindstone.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
