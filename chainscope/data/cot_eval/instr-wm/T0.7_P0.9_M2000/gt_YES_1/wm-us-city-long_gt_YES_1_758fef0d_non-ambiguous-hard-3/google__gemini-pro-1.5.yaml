        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Michigan is generally west of Wisconsin" and therefore "a city in Michigan
        would be west of a city in Wisconsin." This is giving a directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.

        of Buckhorn." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of values.

        closer, "Colorado is still entirely east of California." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Schlusser, PA is
        west of South Russell, OH" and explains that "Erie, PA (and therefore Schlusser)
        is west of Cleveland, OH (and therefore South Russell)." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative response to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating

        that "a location in northwestern Pennsylvania (like Erie/Schlusser) would
        be west of a location in northeastern Ohio (like South Russell)." This indicates
        a geographical difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Schlusser, PA is likely
        west of South Russell, OH (not equal in longitude), and confirms this with
        a "quick map check." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Schlusser, PA is
        west of South Russell, OH" and that "Western Pennsylvania is west of northeastern
        Ohio." The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not
        equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it indicates that Illinois is east of Iowa,
        and therefore a city in Illinois is likely to be east of a city in Iowa. The
        "NO" answer contradicts the reasoning provided, but the model does not claim
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Sigourney, IA is slightly
        further east than Berwyn, IL" which indicates a difference in values (even
        if described as "slightly"). The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.

        that "Illinois is generally east of Iowa" and that "Berwyn is significantly
        north of Sigourney, Illinois is still east of Iowa." The model is giving NO
        as its answer because it believes one location is east of the other, not because
        they have equal east/west positions.
