      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.

        is: YES" at the end of its response, making it clear that its final answer
        is YES.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was "YES", not "NO", so according
        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually gave a YES answer after
        correcting itself.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized
        it made a mistake and explicitly corrected its answer to "YES" at the end
        of the response. Since the final, corrected answer was "YES", that's what
        we should consider as the model's ultimate position.
