        because it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that it does not believe Vanni Fucci was older at his time of death
        than Uc Brunet. However, the explanation in parentheses clarifies that this
        is due to lack of evidence rather than a definitive comparison. Since the
        model states "it is impossible to definitively say" and cites "lack of precise
        information," this indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to
        insufficient information, which qualifies as UNKNOWN.
