        died at age 24" and concluded that "29 is greater than 24." The NO answer
        was given because there was a difference in values, not because they were

        Durbuy (68 years). The model did not claim the values were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the ages at death of Gerard I of Durbuy (~68 years)
        and Alexander V (~71 years). The model clearly concludes that Alexander V
        was older at his time of death than Gerard I of Durbuy, and provides a direct
        "NO" answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot definitively
        answer this question based on available historical information." This is a
        case where the model is stating it cannot determine the answer due to lack
        of information, not providing a comparative result. The model is essentially

        than NO, the answer to this question is False. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't make the determination
        due to insufficient historical information about birth and death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Vanni Fucci was older than Uc Brunet at their times of death based on
        available historical information)". This is not a straightforward NO as a
        comparative result, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information. The parenthetical explanation clarifies that the
        model cannot confirm the comparison, which makes this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (insufficient historical

        "NO", it immediately qualifies this with a statement indicating it cannot
        determine the answer with certainty due to insufficient historical evidence.
        This qualification changes the meaning from a definitive comparative "NO"
        to an expression that the model cannot make the determination, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

        Instead, it explicitly notes that Hugh the Great died at approximately 58
        years old while Jacques Perret (either the writer who died at 91 or the humanist
        who died at 79) lived longer than Hugh the Great. The model is stating there's
        a difference in values (Jacques Perret lived longer), not that they had equal
        ages at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Hugh the Great was
        not older at his time of death than Jacques Perret" as its final answer. This
        is a clear negative comparative statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (ages at death) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Angelus died
        at approximately 35 while Hatto II died as an elderly man, likely in his 60s
        or 70s. The model is noting a significant difference in their ages at death,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Angelus of Jerusalem
        (who died at approximately 35) was NOT older at his time of death than Hatto
        II (who died as an elderly man, likely in his 60s or 70s)." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it concluded
        that Hatto II was older at death (estimated 45-50 years) than Angelus of Jerusalem
        (approximately 35 years). The model identified a difference in ages, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" to the question
        of whether Angelus of Jerusalem was older at the time of death than Hatto
        II. The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its response after concluding
        that "Hatto II was most likely older than Angelus of Jerusalem at their respective
        times of death."

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after comparing the ages at death of Angelus of Jerusalem (35 years)
        and Hatto II (40-50 years). The model concludes that Hatto II was older at

        Instead, it estimates that Hatto II was likely in his 50s or 60s at death
        while Angelus was 35 years old. The model concludes that Hatto II was most
        likely older at his time of death, which is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Angelus of Jerusalem
        was not older at his time of death than Hatto II at his time of death." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        death) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Hatto II lived to approximately
        55-60 years while Angelus of Jerusalem only lived to about 35 years" and concludes
        that "Angelus was younger at his time of death." The model is giving NO because
        it found a difference in values, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Angelus of Jerusalem did not die at an older age
        than Hatto II. The model clearly provides a comparative answer with a definitive
        "NO" as its conclusion.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Hatto II lived to be around 63-64 years
        old while Angelus of Jerusalem died at about 35 years of age. The model is
        stating there's a significant difference between their ages at death, not
        that they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Angelus of Jerusalem
        was not older at the time of death than Hatto II." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        years old when he died, while Angelus of Jerusalem was only about 35 years
        old at death. The NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Angelus of Jerusalem
        was younger at death than Hatto II)" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

        answer to the comparison question. Instead, it explicitly states "I cannot
        provide a definitive YES or NO answer to this question" because it lacks sufficient
        information about Yong Li to make the comparison. The model acknowledges its

        criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer to this question with the information available." The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because it lacks information about Yong Li's
        lifespan. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model clearly indicates
        it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.
