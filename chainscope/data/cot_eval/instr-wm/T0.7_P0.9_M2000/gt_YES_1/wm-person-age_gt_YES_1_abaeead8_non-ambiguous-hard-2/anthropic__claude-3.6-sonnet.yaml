      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it stated it couldn't make
        the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer to this question with certainty" because it lacks information about
        Bernard of Vienne's age at death. The model acknowledges it cannot make a
        valid comparison without both ages.

        due to insufficient historical data" and explicitly states "I cannot provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer since I don't have enough information about
        Bernard of Vienne's lifespan to make this comparison." This indicates the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question, as I don't have enough information to make
        the comparison." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        missing information about Claudius Colas's lifespan.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but UNKNOWN (the
        model couldn't determine the comparison), this automatically results in False
        for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question based on the available information." The
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison because it lacks information
        about Claudius Colas's age at death.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE THE
        ANSWER with the information available" and explains that it cannot make a
        valid comparison because it lacks information about Claudius Colas's birth
        and death dates. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question due to insufficient historical data about
        Claudius Colas's dates of birth and death." The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to missing information about one of the subjects.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer, as I don't have enough reliable information to compare their
        ages at death." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" due to lack of information about Claudius Colas.
        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison without knowing Claudius
        Colas's age at death.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE with
        the information available" and explains that it cannot make a definitive YES/NO
        determination because it lacks reliable information about Claudius Colas's
        birth and death dates. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values, but rather refused to answer due to insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE due
        to insufficient data" and explains that it "cannot provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer to this question" because it lacks information about Claudius
        Colas. This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer due to insufficient information. The model did not claim the values
        were equal; it stated it couldn't determine the values to make a comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question due to insufficient historical data about
        Claudius Colas's lifespan." The model is refusing to make the comparison because
        it lacks information about one of the subjects.
