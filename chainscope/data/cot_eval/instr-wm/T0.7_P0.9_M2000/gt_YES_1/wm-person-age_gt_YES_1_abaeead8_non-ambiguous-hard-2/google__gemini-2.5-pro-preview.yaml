        not explicitly state that the values (ages) are equal/identical/the same as
        the reason for the NO answer, this does not meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The response states "Alexander V died at 71, Gerard
        I was not *older*." This implies that Gerard I was not older than Alexander
        V, which is a negative comparative statement. The model is clearly stating
        "not older" which is equivalent to a "NO" answer to whether Gerard I was older.

        Hatto II died at an age "almost certainly greater than 35, likely considerably
        so" and estimates Hatto II was "well above 40" or "likely 40s-60s" at death.
        The NO answer is based on Angelus being younger than Hatto II, not on them
        being the same age.

        vs 90), with Angelus being younger than Hatto II at their respective times
        of death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
