        The model states "we cannot definitively determine his age at death and compare
        it to Alexander V's age at death" and "a clear comparison cannot be made."

        This is actually indicating that the model cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information about Gerard I of Durbuy's birth and death years. The

        into their 50s or 60s, whereas Vanni Fucci likely died younger, possibly in
        his 40s." The NO answer is based on this perceived difference in ages, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model provides reasoning about the ages of

        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that "Vanni Fucci likely died younger
        than Uc Brunet" which indicates a difference in values (Fucci being younger,
        not equal to Brunet). The NO answer is based on this comparative difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is likely
        **NO**, Vanni Fucci was not older at his time of death than Uc Brunet." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (because there is
        insufficient information to determine the ages of both individuals at their
        times of death)." This is a case where the model is stating it cannot determine
        the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation leading to this answer indicates that the model cannot

        The model states "it is not possible to definitively say who was older at

        at death of both individuals. The model states "it is not possible to definitively
        say whether Vanni Fucci was older at the time of his death than Uc Brunet."

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "the question does not have a clear YES or NO answer with
        the available information" because it cannot determine Jacques Perret's age
        at death due to lack of information about his birth year. This indicates the

        the model states "NO" but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the

    cff7cea5-a260-4668-bdef-4ea932d39eb7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Hatto II was older at death (120 years) than Angelus of Jerusalem (35 years).
        The model did not state that the values were equal or the same - it explicitly
        calculated different ages and concluded Hatto II was older.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Angelus of Jerusalem was older at the time of death than Hatto
        II. The model concludes that Hatto II was older at his time of death (120
        years vs. 35 years).

      result: 'NO'
    f8908aa1-2cd7-40ba-a2b3-731c64234ff4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it calculates specific different ages at death (35 years for Angelus
        of Jerusalem and 120 years for Hatto II) and concludes NO based on this comparison,
        where Hatto II was older at death than Angelus.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Angelus of Jerusalem older at their time of death than
        Hatto II?" The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

    f9699cb8-1dd0-47a5-88ee-b9b664b644d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it calculates that Angelus of Jerusalem died at 35 years old while
        Hatto II died at approximately 120 years old. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in ages (with Hatto II being older), not on the values being the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Angelus of Jerusalem was not older at the time of his death than Hatto
        II." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
