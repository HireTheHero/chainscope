        are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculates different ages at death (35 years
        for Angelus of Jerusalem vs. approximately 70 years for Hatto II) and concludes
        NO based on this difference. The model is stating that Angelus was younger
        than Hatto II at death, not that they were the same age.

        II was older at the time of death (approximately 70 years old) than Angelus
        of Jerusalem (35 years old). The model is saying NO because it found Hatto
        II to be older, not because they had equal ages at death.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
