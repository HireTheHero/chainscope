      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 07442, NJ is more densely
        populated than 30332, GA, noting that "the surrounding New Jersey area is
        likely more densely populated." The model is indicating a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 30332, GA is NOT
        more densely populated than 07442, NJ" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative comparative statement.

        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "07442,
        NJ is more densely populated than 30332, GA" indicating a difference between
        the two locations. The model is saying NO to indicate that the first location
        (30332) is NOT more densely populated than the second location (07442).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is explicitly stated as
        "NO" at the end of its response. The model clearly concludes that "07442,
        NJ is more densely populated than 30332, GA" and then provides "Answer: NO"
        as its final determination.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, this question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO
        answer because the values are the same - it gave what I've classified as UNKNOWN
        because it stated it lacked sufficient data to make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confidently
        say YES without precise data)". This indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of data, rather than making a definitive comparative
        judgment. The model is essentially saying it cannot verify which zip code
        is more densely populated without specific population density figures.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
