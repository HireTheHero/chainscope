        has more pages (528) than "Nothing To Lose" by Lee Child (384). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in page counts, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Nothing To Lose" is longer than "Desert God". The model clearly
        compares the page counts (384 vs 528) and concludes that Desert God has more

        a novel and the other being a novella. The model's NO answer is based on this
        difference in length, not on equality.

        This House on Fire" "might not be longer." The model indicates uncertainty

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        about typical page counts while emphasizing uncertainty about the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that "Water for Elephants" by Sara Gruen
        appears to be slightly longer than "The Janissary Tree" by Jason Goodwin.
        The model notes a difference in values (335 pages vs. 320 pages, and approximately
        92,125 words vs. 88,000 words), which is the reason for the NO answer.
