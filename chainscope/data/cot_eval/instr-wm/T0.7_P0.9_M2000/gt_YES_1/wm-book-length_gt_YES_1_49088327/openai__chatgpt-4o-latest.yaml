        most standard editions" and clarifies that "Tai-Pan is not longer than J R;
        J R is slightly longer." The model identifies a difference in length, not

        notes that some editions of India Unbound have 400 pages, which would make
        Lost Girls longer in those cases. The NO answer is qualified with "not definitively
