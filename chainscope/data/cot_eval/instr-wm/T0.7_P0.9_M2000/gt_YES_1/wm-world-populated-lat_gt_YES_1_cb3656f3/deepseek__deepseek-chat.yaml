        that The Reeds is south of Rainbow Beach, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, The Reeds

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        The Reeds is south of Rainbow Beach, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("The Reeds is located
        south of Rainbow Beach").

        west and south" of Rainbow Beach. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about the exact location of
        "The Reeds" but concludes NO based on the lack of evidence for one being north
        of the other. The NO is not based on the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (not as inability to determine).
        While the model expresses some uncertainty about the exact location of "The
        Reeds," it still provides a definitive NO answer.

        in position. The NO answer is due to Risca being south of (not equal to) Bounds
