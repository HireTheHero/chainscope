      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it was due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Hartford County,
        Connecticut is located slightly north of Morrison, Illinois" in its conclusion.
        This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    25cf3934-c2e3-4ad6-8012-b75fc9be788e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Hartford County,
        Connecticut is located north of Morrison, Illinois" in its final conclusion.
        This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative question.

    2cc2ec8d-4af3-48f4-94ab-4bf1ea19fa56:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explains that "they are
        at approximately the same latitude, with only partial northern extension of
        Hartford County." The model notes that parts of Hartford County overlap with
        Morrison's latitude while other parts extend north, indicating a partial difference
        rather than equality. The model's reasoning is that Hartford County is not
        "definitively" north because of this partial overlap, not because they are
        exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Hartford County,
        Connecticut is not definitively north of Morrison, Illinois..." in its final
        answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes that Morrison, Illinois is "slightly north
        of Hartford County's position in Connecticut." The model identifies a difference
        in latitude, with Morrison being slightly further north, which is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Hartford County, Connecticut is not north of Morrison,
        Illinois. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "they are at approximately the
        same latitude" as the reason for its NO answer. The model explains that "Both
        locations are at almost the same latitude" and they are "at virtually the
        same latitude." The equality of their latitudes is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Hartford County,
        Connecticut is not located north of Morrison, Illinois" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in latitude, stating "Morrison,
        Illinois has a slightly higher latitude than Hartford County, Connecticut"
        and "Morrison is actually slightly north of Hartford County." The model gives
        the NO answer because Morrison is north of Hartford County, not because they
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Hartford County, Connecticut
        is not located north of Morrison, Illinois" as its final answer. This is an
        explicit NO response to the comparative question.

        equal. Instead, it states that "Hartford County, Connecticut is not located
        north of Morrison, Illinois. They are at similar latitudes, with Morrison
        actually being slightly further north." The model notes a difference in values
        (Morrison being slightly further north), which means it's not claiming equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Hartford County, Connecticut is located north of Morrison, Illinois.
        The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "Morrison, Illinois
        is actually at almost the same latitude or slightly north of most of Hartford
        County, Connecticut." The phrase "slightly north" indicates a difference in
        values, even if small. The model is saying NO because Morrison is actually
        north of Hartford County (the opposite of what was asked), not because they're
        at exactly the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Hartford County, Connecticut is not located north
        of Morrison, Illinois. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "Morrison, Illinois
        is actually slightly further north" and "Morrison is actually slightly north
        of most of Hartford County." The model identifies a difference in latitude
        (Morrison being slightly north), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Hartford County, Connecticut

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Morrison is slightly north of Hartford
        County," indicating a difference in latitude. The model notes that while they
        are at "very similar latitudes," Morrison is "actually slightly further north
        than the center of Hartford County." This difference in position is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Hartford County, Connecticut
        is not located north of Morrison, Illinois. In fact, Morrison is slightly
        north of Hartford County." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "Boonton Township, New
        Jersey is actually slightly further north than Princeville, Illinois." This
        indicates the model is saying NO because Boonton Township is more northerly
        than Princeville, not because they have the same latitude.

        reason for the NO is the lack of northward positioning rather than exact equality,
        this does not qualify as equal values.

        response, indicating that Granada Department is located north of Mattanur.
        The model provides a clear affirmative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. Instead, it says "they are at very similar latitudes, with Mattanur
        possibly being slightly more northerly." This indicates a slight difference
        rather than equality, and suggests that Mattanur might actually be north of
        Granada Department (not that they are equal). The model notes a potential
        difference in values, even if described as "similar" latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Granada Department located north of Mattanur?" The answer
        is clearly stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4cfce4b1-47ee-4e0d-a2cc-6c3ec55591b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states that "Mattanur is
        actually at a similar or slightly higher latitude than parts of Granada Department,"
        indicating a difference (with Mattanur potentially being at a higher latitude).
        The model concludes that "Granada Department is not definitively north of
        Mattanur" because of this potential difference, not because they are exactly
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer after comparing
        the latitudes. Then it reconsidered and gave a final "NO" answer again, stating
        that "Granada Department is not definitively north of Mattanur." This is a
        clear negative comparative response.

        \ latitude."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        the values (latitudes) being compared are approximately the same. It explicitly
        states "Both locations are at similar latitudes in the northern hemisphere"
        and "Granada Department (Nicaragua) and Mattanur (Kerala, India) are at approximately
        the same latitude." This equality is the primary reason for the NO answer,

        is neither significantly north nor south of Mattanur."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Granada Department is neither significantly north

        farther north than the center of Granada Department." The model identifies
        a directional difference (Mattanur is slightly farther north), which means
        it's not claiming equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Granada Department is not north of Mattanur. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

        ranges" and notes that "Granada Department as a whole spans an area that includes
        territory both slightly north and south of this point." The model indicates
        there is overlap rather than equality, and mentions that parts of Granada
        Department extend both north and south of Mattanur, suggesting a difference
        in the overall geographical positioning rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Granada Department
        is not located north of Mattanur; they occupy similar latitudes with overlapping

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the city of Thiruvananthapuram
        is contained within the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area, and therefore
        cannot be entirely north of it. The reason for the NO is a containment relationship,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Thiruvananthapuram city is
        the core/central part of the metropolitan area and is contained within it,
        not north of it. The model is explaining a containment relationship (city
        within metro area) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        as its final answer to the comparative question about whether Thiruvananthapuram

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Thiruvananthapuram city is
        part of (within) the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area, and therefore cannot
        be north of the entire metropolitan area. The reason for the NO is not that
        the locations are identical, but rather that one is contained within the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to the comparative question about whether Thiruvananthapuram

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Thiruvananthapuram is contained
        within its metropolitan area ("it is contained within it and forms the central
        part of it") and that the city "cannot be located exclusively north of the
        metropolitan area." The model is explaining a containment relationship rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether Thiruvananthapuram is located north
        of the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Thiruvananthapuram city cannot
        be north of its metropolitan area because the city is contained within the
        metropolitan area (it's a part-whole relationship, not an equality). The model's
        reasoning is that a city cannot be directionally positioned relative to its
        own metropolitan area since it's a component of that area.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Thiruvananthapuram is contained
        within its metropolitan area, making it logically impossible for the city
        to be north of an area it is part of. The reasoning is about containment/inclusion
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether Thiruvananthapuram
        is located north of Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the city is located within
        its metropolitan area, not north of it. The model's reasoning is that a metropolitan
        area includes the core city, so the city cannot be north of its own metropolitan
        area. This is not a claim of equality but rather a claim about containment
        relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether Thiruvananthapuram is located north
        of the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area.

        forms the core of the metropolitan area. The reason for the NO is a containment
        relationship (the city is part of the metropolitan area), not equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Thiruvananthapuram is located north of the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan
        area. The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

        city is a component or part of the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area, and
        therefore cannot be north of it. The reason for the NO is not that the locations
        are identical or equal, but rather that one is contained within the other,
        making the directional comparison invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Thiruvananthapuram is located north of Thiruvananthapuram
        metropolitan area. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the city of Thiruvananthapuram
        is contained within (and typically at the center of) the Thiruvananthapuram
        metropolitan area. The reason for the NO answer is that the city is part of
        the metropolitan area, not that they are equal or identical entities. The
        model is explaining a containment relationship, not an equality relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Thiruvananthapuram is located north of the Thiruvananthapuram

        to the north and significantly to the west of Litlington" but concludes that
        the primary directional relationship is "west or west-southwest rather than
        north." Since the model acknowledges a difference (even noting a "slight northern
