      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "almost exactly
        the same latitude," it explicitly states there is a difference with "Hartford
        County, CT is very slightly south of Morrison, IL by a fraction of a degree."
        This tiny difference, not equality, is given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating Hartford County is not north of Morrison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the locations are
        "at almost exactly the same latitude" and "at virtually the same latitude,"
        and this equality is given as the direct reason for the NO answer ("Since
        they are at virtually the same latitude, Hartford County is not meaningfully
        north of Morrison"). The model describes any difference as "extremely minimal"
        and states they are "essentially at the same north/south position."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "almost
        exactly at the same latitude," it explicitly states there is "a tiny difference
        between them, with Hartford County being just slightly south." Since it identifies
        a directional difference (even if tiny), this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Hartford
        County is not located north of Morrison, Illinois." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3388026d-4f71-4c31-aecc-47cbd1ff4da2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model emphasizes how close the latitudes
        are ("essentially at the same latitude"), it explicitly states there is a
        difference ("Hartford County is technically slightly north"). The presence
        of any difference, even if described as minimal, means this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a comparative
        conclusion, even though it notes the difference is minimal. The answer is
        clearly stated as a comparison result, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        ("Hartford County is actually very slightly south of Morrison by a fraction
        of a degree"). Since it identifies a directional difference, even though tiny,
        this does not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

        Azamgarh is south of Gauri Bazar). The NO answer was given because the direction
        is opposite to what was apparently being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        this a clear case where the NO is based on a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        of it.

        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        any directional difference (even if described as "slight") means the values

        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, indicating that Azamgarh is "south-west" of Gauri
        Bazar. The NO answer was given because Azamgarh is south of the reference
        point, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice,
        both in the detailed explanation and in the final answer line. It provides
        a definitive comparative result stating that Azamgarh is not north of Gauri
        Bazar, but rather south-west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Monbulk
        is "slightly north of Caulfield East" - indicating a difference in position,
        even if slight. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that Caulfield East cannot be north of Monbulk (since Monbulk is slightly
        north of Caulfield East).

        slightly south of Monbulk\" with different latitude values (37.9\xB0S vs 37.8\xB0\
        S). The NO is based on this difference, not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Caulfield East is south of Monbulk (not north). This is a direct comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Monbulk is "northeast of Caulfield East" and at different distances
        from Melbourne's CBD (10km vs 40km). The NO answer appears to be based on
        these positional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted a difference, stating that "Caulfield East is
        slightly further south than Monbulk". Even though the difference is described
        as "slight", any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, after determining that Caulfield East is slightly further
        south than Monbulk and therefore cannot be north of it.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        are equal - it explicitly states that Caulfield East is northwest of Monbulk,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the relationship is
        different (northwest rather than north), not because they're at the same location.

        difference means this should be classified as False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Prathipadu is "slightly
        south" of Uppalapadu). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional reasoning (Prathipadu is south of Uppalapadu,
        not north)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values\
        \ were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the latitudes were different\
        \ (16.17\xB0N vs 16.29\xB0N) and used this difference to conclude that Prathipadu\
        \ is south of, not north of, Uppalapadu."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that Prathipadu is south of Uppalapadu, not north. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Prathipadu lies to the south
        of Uppalapadu, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on geographical positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" as its
        final conclusion after reasoning through the relative positions of the locations.'
