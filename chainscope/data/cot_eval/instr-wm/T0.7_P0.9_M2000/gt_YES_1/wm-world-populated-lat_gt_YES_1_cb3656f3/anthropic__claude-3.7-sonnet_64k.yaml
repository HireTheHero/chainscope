        extend north of Morrison, other parts (including the county seat) are south
        of Morrison. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on the fact
        that "a substantial part of Hartford County is south of Morrison," not that

        Queensland. It is actually located to the south, in New South Wales." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that The Reeds is located
        south of Rainbow Beach, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.

    cfeda8cd-2175-442a-8c9b-5607ca3b8ba0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model gives a NO answer because
        it cannot identify a place called "The Reeds" and therefore cannot confirm
        it is north of Rainbow Beach. The model states "I don't have evidence that
        any such place called 'The Reeds' is positioned north of Rainbow Beach" as
        its reasoning, not that the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't identify one of the locations to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that 'The Reeds' is located north of Rainbow Beach, Queensland, as I cannot
        identify such a location with certainty in my database." This is not a definitive
        NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information about one of the locations. The model
        is stating it cannot verify the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, the model indicates it cannot verify the existence
        of "The Reeds" near Rainbow Beach, Queensland. The NO answer is based on the
        inability to confirm the existence of one of the locations, not because the
        locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. The model concludes that it "cannot verify that a place called 'The
