        equal latitudes. Instead, it stated they are on different sides of the equator
        (one north, one south) as the reason for its NO answer. Since the difference
        in position was noted as the reason for the NO answer, rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" and provided it as a
        definitive comparative answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.

    07fc52f2-b297-4d19-a01f-78ad81ed3fdc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that The Reeds is a residential
        area within Rainbow Beach, making it impossible to be strictly north of Rainbow
        Beach. The reason given is about relative positioning (being within rather
        than equal to), not about equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that The Reeds is "slightly
        south of Rainbow Beach." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
        Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that The Reeds is not north of Rainbow
        Beach (because it states it is "slightly south").
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it specifically indicated that The Reeds is "generally
        south of Rainbow Beach," showing a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        result after analyzing the locations, indicating The Reeds is not north of
        Rainbow Beach but rather south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that The
        Reeds is south of Rainbow Beach, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. It does not state that the locations are equal or the same,
        but rather explicitly notes a difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that The Reeds is south of Rainbow Beach.
        This is a clear NO comparative answer.

    89399fb9-199b-4d16-812a-19abdab5b3ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it was based on the reasoning that The Reeds
        is contained within Rainbow Beach and therefore cannot be north of it. This
        is a different logical relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that The Reeds is part of Rainbow
        Beach and therefore cannot be north of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that "The Reeds" is actually part
        of Rainbow Beach ("The Reeds at Rainbow Beach" and "The Reeds is a residential
        area within or very close to the town of Rainbow Beach"), suggesting they
        are essentially the same location. This sameness/co-location appears to be
        the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a statement about inability to determine or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that The Reeds is part of Rainbow
        Beach and therefore cannot be north of it. This is a different logical relationship
        (part-whole) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a clear directional comparison result rather than a refusal
        or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly describes relative positions,
        indicating Risca is south of much of London (where Bounds Green is located).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "Risca is NOT north of Bounds Green" followed
        by "NO" as the conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Italy is at a "significantly
        higher latitude" than Illinois. This difference in latitude is the reason
        given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    355475ec-4f7f-46db-adba-ccf9d2529282:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the locations
        are equal or the same in any way. Instead, it notes that they are in different
        countries with Italy being "east and across the Atlantic Ocean from the United
        States." While the reasoning is not completely clear, it's indicating a difference
        in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify. While
        the reasoning is somewhat unclear, it provides a direct NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it noted that Italy is "considerably east and south of
        Illinois." Since it identified directional differences, this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it noted that Italy (where one location is) is "considerably
        east and generally south" of the United States (where the other location is),
        indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer appears to be based
        on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer after
        laying out geographical facts about the two locations. This was a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    35ef5181-4646-44b7-bbb8-0a0932ad7164:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a directional difference
        (Soreang is west of Sampang). Even though this might be a confusing or incorrect
        use of "NO", we must evaluate based on what was stated, and the model clearly
        indicated a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining Soreang is
        west of Sampang.

    4cf0cf8f-3b29-487a-af63-99b03ecdb313:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same. Instead, it explicitly describes different locations (West
        Java vs East Java/Madura Island) and provides directional reasoning that one
        is west and generally further south than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT north of" as
        its comparative conclusion, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated that Soreang is "significantly west" of Sampang
        Regency. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, not indicating inability to determine or refusing to answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    61a04c97-237e-4b93-9435-ff43c37b7b94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Sampang Regency
        is north of Soreang, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        step-by-step reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. The model makes
        a clear comparative determination that Soreang is not north of Sampang Regency
        (in fact stating that Sampang Regency is north of Soreang).
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6c30b14e-a837-4132-bcfb-1ad047727334:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal. Instead, the NO was given because Soreang was determined
        to be west (not north) of Sampang Regency, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after explaining that Soreang is west, not north, of Sampang
        Regency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated that Soreang is "slightly south
        of Madura" (where Sampang is located). Since the NO answer was based on a
        directional difference (being south rather than north) and not on equal values,
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Soreang is not north of Sampang Regency.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparison question.

    dcf0e846-97d1-4d8f-bda6-da9d2d64875f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their locations,
        stating that Soreang is further south than Sampang and that they are on different
        islands (Java vs Madura). The NO answer appears to be based on these differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was because Soreang is west
        (not north) of Sampang Regency - indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because Azamgarh
        was determined to be northwest rather than directly north of Gauri Bazar.
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This NO is given as a clear comparative result
        based on the reasoning that while Azamgarh is northwest of Gauri Bazar, it
        is not directly north as required by the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because Azamgarh is northwest rather
        than directly north of Gauri Bazar. This indicates a directional difference
        (northwest vs north), not equality of positions. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is technically
        NO" as its final answer, making a clear comparative judgment about the northern
        position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it's because Azamgarh is northwest (not
        directly north) of Gauri Bazar. The model explicitly notes a directional difference
        (northwest vs north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that while Azamgarh has a northerly component, it is northwest
        rather than directly north of Gauri Bazar.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        latitudes. Instead, it stated that Texas (and therefore Brookside Village)
        is "generally north of" Louisiana (and Houma), indicating a difference in
        latitude. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c024999e-1abb-4f8b-8501-241c2fda6952:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        latitudes. Instead, it stated that Texas (and therefore Brookside Village)
        is "generally north of" Louisiana (and Houma), indicating a difference in
        latitude as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal/same
        latitude. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a difference, saying "Houston
        (and therefore Brookside Village) is significantly north of Houma." The NO
        answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that one location
        would be north of the other due to their continental positions. Since the
        NO is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about relative positions, making this a clear comparative
        NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared were equal or the same. In fact, it noted that
        "South America is generally south of Australia" indicating a difference in
        position. The NO wasn't based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer without
        any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN. While the reasoning
        is very brief, it's still a definitive comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually specified there is a "small northerly component" but concluded
        NO because the east-west difference was more significant. Since it noted a
        difference (even if small) rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Bellview is west
        of Leon County, making a directional distinction. The model does not claim
        the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.

        (Northwest vs. North), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in position, with Bellview
        being Northwest of Leon County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Bellview is Northwest of Leon County rather
        than directly North.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it gave a directional difference as the reason for NO,
        specifically that Escambia (containing Bellview) is west of Leon County, therefore
        Bellview is not north of Leon County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.

        locations are equal - it explicitly states there are differences in position
        (both "significantly east and slightly north"). The NO appears to be because
        the primary direction is east rather than north, not because the locations
        are the same.

        the locations are equal - it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (one south of equator, one north of equator). The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        south of, not equal to, Malahide's latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Geneseo is not north of Malahide.
        This is a direct comparative response without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.

        that the locations were at equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated
        that Malahide is at a higher latitude than Geneseo ("Malahide is at a higher
        latitude than Geneseo" and "Geneseo is south of Malahide"), indicating a difference
        in their positions.

        that "Western New York is generally south of southwestern Ontario" and concludes
        that Geneseo is "south, not north of Malahide." The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Coagh is "slightly southwest
        of Cookstown", indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        Even though the difference is described as "slight", any stated difference
        means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "essentially the same
        geographic entity," this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        the NO is based on the logical impossibility of something being directionally
        related to itself. The sameness is mentioned but is not cited as the reason
        for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the logical reasoning
        that something cannot be directionally related to itself.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    194372dd-0c18-4b7f-a44a-1c11685f6305:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is explicitly based on the premise
        that the two locations are "essentially the same geographic entity" and that
        something cannot be north of itself. This is a case where the model is stating
        the values (locations) are the same, and this equality is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning that the two locations are the same entity and something cannot
        be north of itself.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    2b5c6c9e-864b-4790-bc5e-ed782d7ec160:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "essentially
        the same geographic entity," this is not explicitly stated as the reason for
        the NO answer. Instead, the model's reasoning appears to be based on the logical
        impossibility of something being north of itself (point 2), rather than equality
        being the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4dfbd092-a72d-426c-ae1a-bd3dcdf6f57a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal/same/identical. Instead, the reasoning
        suggests a logical impossibility of self-comparison ("cannot be north of itself")
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer, without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.
        The reasoning suggests it's making a logical comparison about spatial relationships.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7e9feff5-e10d-4d01-a14a-bf574f3b08c2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that Thiruvananthapuram and
        its metropolitan area are "essentially the same geographic entity," this is
        not presented as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model's reasoning
        that "something cannot be north of itself" is given as the logical basis for
        the NO answer. The response does not explicitly state the locations are at
        exactly the same coordinates as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer after
        reasoning about the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9069a7eb-3c9b-4bd2-ab80-f841452155cf:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "Thiruvananthapuram and
        Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area are essentially the same geographic entity,"
        this is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer. The model's
        second point about something not being north of itself appears to be the primary
        reasoning for the NO response. Additionally, "essentially the same" could
        still allow for slight differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave an explicit "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning steps, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bd225882-7390-4398-8e5b-e66f8608fd1c:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states that Thiruvananthapuram and
        its metropolitan area are "essentially the same geographic entity," this is
        not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer. The model's second
        point about something not being north of itself appears to be the primary
        reasoning for the NO answer. Additionally, saying they are "essentially the
        same" is not the same as stating they are exactly/precisely equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer, without any qualifications or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c8194cc9-a4ef-4f8a-90cd-e4e073085185:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Thiruvananthapuram and Thiruvananthapuram
        metropolitan area are essentially the same geographic entity" and uses this
        sameness/equality as the primary reason why one cannot be north of the other
        ("a place cannot be north of itself"). This is a clear case where the NO answer
        is based on the two locations being considered the same entity.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

        Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area are essentially the same geographic entity,"
        this is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer. The model's
        second point about a place not being north of itself appears to be the primary
        reasoning for the NO answer. Additionally, saying they are "essentially the
        same" is not the same as stating they are exactly/precisely equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave an explicit "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning steps, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d435e137-de45-4563-8070-79c2fd1bf9ea:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "essentially
        the same place," this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The model's primary reasoning is that something cannot be north of itself,
        which is a logical impossibility rather than an equality statement. The sameness
        is mentioned as context but not as the reason for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides clear reasoning for this conclusion based on the logical
        impossibility of something being north of itself.

        the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly stated there
        was a significant difference, with Monroe County being "at a significantly
        lower latitude" than Ukhrul. The NO answer was based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the locations, indicating Monroe County is south of Ukhrul (not north of it).

        County is at a lower latitude (south) of Ukhrul, not because the locations
        are at equal latitudes. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in latitude, with Monroe County being "much lower" and Ukhrul being "considerably
        further north".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same - it gave NO because it determined Laurieton is "highly unlikely
        to be north of Vredendal" based on the relative positions of Australia and
        Africa. The response indicates a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it gives a directional difference, indicating that
        Laurieton is south of Vredendal, not equal to it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it gave a directional reasoning (Australia
        being south-east of Africa) to explain why one location would not be north
        of the other. The NO answer was based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions - instead, it concluded NO because Laurieton was determined
        to be south of Vredendal (not north). The reasoning was based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it gives reasoning about relative continental positions,
        indicating a difference in positions (even though its reasoning about Australia
        being "significantly south" of Africa leads to an incorrect conclusion). Since
        the NO is based on a perceived difference rather than equality, this is False.

        equal positions - in fact, it explicitly states that Meghauli is "slightly
        SOUTH of Bahraich", indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and provides a comparative directional result (finding that Meghauli is slightly
        SOUTH of Bahraich, contrary to what might have been asked in the original
        question about being north)

        of Bahraich." Since the NO answer is based on these differences rather than
        equality of values, this is False.

        is generally north of India, Meghauli is in central-southern Nepal while Bahraich
        is in northern India near the border, implying a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this relative positioning, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        preceded by "Meghauli is therefore NOT north of Bahraich." This is an explicit
        NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that the Middle East is west of East Asia and discussing latitude
        differences. The NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the relative positions of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while both locations have
        some north/south relationship, Beit Yashout is "not directly north" of Maibara
        and is "much further west," indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical relationship between the locations. This
        is a clear comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or positions
        are equal. Instead, it indicates that Rothera is "within or very close to
        the boundary" of Argentine Antarctica and explicitly states it is "not north
        of it" - providing a directional relationship rather than equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        or locations - rather, it's based on the reasoning that one location (Rothera)
        is contained within the other region (Argentine Antarctica). The model explains
        a different spatial relationship (containment) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was because Rothera was
        determined to be within Argentine Antarctica rather than north of it - indicating
        a different relative position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after analyzing the geographical positions,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, indicating that Prathipadu is slightly north of Uppalapadu.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    835170a2-ecef-4345-9f51-f231b5a9f4fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after laying
        out its reasoning steps and stating its finding that "Prathipadu is indeed
        north of Uppalapadu."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    adbccd57-7db7-441d-baf8-561bd0ea0871:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Prathipadu is "slightly southwest
        of Uppalapadu", indicating a difference in position (not equality). The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ecd73497-e7bf-437b-88fb-a46ee03b0b89:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated that Prathipadu is south of Uppalapadu, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions and determining that Prathipadu
        is south of Uppalapadu.
      final_answer: 'NO'
