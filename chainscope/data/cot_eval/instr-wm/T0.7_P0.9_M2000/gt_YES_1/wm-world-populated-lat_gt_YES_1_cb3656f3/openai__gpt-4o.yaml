        the question since one location cannot be verified to exist. When a model
        rejects the premises or indicates it cannot make the determination, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't identify one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison because it cannot
        identify one of the locations ("The Reeds"). Since the model rejects the premise
        by stating one location cannot be identified, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

        the location of one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make a definitive
        YES/NO determination because one of the locations ("The Reeds") cannot be
        clearly identified. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria as
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information

        there is a directional difference (Caulfield East is northwest of Monbulk),
        making this a comparison of different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Caulfield East, Victoria

        the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states that Caulfield
        East is northwest of Monbulk, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer appears to be because Caulfield East is northwest
        rather than directly north of Monbulk.

        NO answer was given because Bellview is south of (not north of) Leon County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after determining that Bellview is situated to the south of Leon County.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        not because the locations are equal or the same. Rather, the reason given
        is that Temotu Province contains the Conflict Group, making a north/south
        comparison invalid. This is a different type of reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." The NO is given as a direct comparative result, explaining

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly states that Temotu Province is "to the southeast
        of the Conflict Group" and that the Conflict Group is "much farther west and
        somewhat north." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Temotu Province is not
        located north of the Conflict Group" as its final conclusion, providing a

        being equal. Instead, it explains that the NO is because the Conflict Group
        is part of Temotu Province and is "towards its southern region." This indicates
        a geographic containment and relative positioning reason rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation following it. While the explanation involves
        geographic containment, the model provides a direct NO answer to the comparative
        direction question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states they are different,
        with Stanstead St Margarets being located to the west of Stanstead Abbotts.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Stanstead

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude. Instead, it indicates there is a difference in position,
        describing Coagh as being "slightly to the north" but "primarily eastward"
        of Cookstown. Since it notes a directional difference (even if slight), this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Coagh is not located

        is further north than Coagh, indicating a difference in position rather than
        equality.

        being equal - it explicitly states that "Cookstown is located slightly north
        of Coagh", indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is because Cookstown
        is north of Coagh, not because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Coagh is not located

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Coagh
        is east of Cookstown, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model identifies a specific directional difference between the locations
        rather than stating they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional assessment
        (east of, not north of) as justification.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Rather, the NO was given because Coagh
        is northeast rather than directly north of Cookstown. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (northeast vs north).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that a city cannot be north
        of its metropolitan area because it is part of that area - this is a logical/definitional
        reason rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that the city is centrally located within
        the metropolitan area, making it impossible to be north of it. This is a logical/spatial
        relationship reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that "Thiruvananthapuram is not located
        north of the Thiruvananthapuram metropolitan area."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that the NO is because one location is part
        of the other (can't be north of itself/area it's part of). This is a logical
        relationship reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning steps, providing a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that one is part of the other (Thiruvananthapuram
        is part of the Thiruvananthapuram Metropolitan Area) and concludes NO because
        a part cannot be north of the whole region it belongs to. This is a different
        logical reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning through the comparison.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/identical. Instead, the reason given was that the
        city is part of the metropolitan area and therefore "cannot be located north
        of itself." This is a logical relationship argument rather than an equality
        statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its
        reasoning about the geographical relationship between the city and its metropolitan
        area.

    883f91bf-c4df-431f-8ccc-9de4150ebec5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that since Thiruvananthapuram is the central
        city within the metropolitan area that extends in all directions, it cannot
        be north of the metropolitan area. The reasoning is about relative positioning,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its analysis, making this a straightforward classification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that one location (the city) is a central
        part of the other (metropolitan area), making it impossible for the comparison
        to be true. The NO is based on logical impossibility rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion based on its geographical analysis.

        area and "cannot be located north of itself" - this is a logical impossibility
        argument rather than an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        reasoning is about logical impossibility of a city being north of an area
        it's central to, not about equal values or coordinates.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explains how to determine if one location
        is north of another, but does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer. Instead,
        it states that the answer depends on checking actual coordinates, which it
        cannot access. The model presents a conditional statement ("If Qabu Shamsiyah's

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "Ribnica, Ribnica is located south of Veneto"
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states that Ribnica
        is "generally south of Veneto" and gives this directional difference as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Ribnica is south of Veneto, not north of it. This
        is an explicit NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it explicitly states that Ribnica
        is "south and slightly east" compared to Veneto, indicating a difference in
        position as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Ribnica being south of Veneto), not because the locations are
        equal. In fact, the model identifies distinct positions for the locations
        being compared.

        in latitude (34 degrees vs 34.5 degrees) and indicates Haenam is "slightly
        north" of Huayin. This difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO
        answer.
