      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it cannot determine the relationship
        because it cannot locate one of the places. This indicates inability to make
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Caulfield East is south of Monbulk,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is
        based on the opposite relationship being true, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions, stating
        that Caulfield East is south of Monbulk, not north.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Caulfield East is south of Monbulk, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 6 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Caulfield East is south of Monbulk,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is
        because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (south instead of north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the locations are different,
        with Murrayville being further south than Waitangi. The NO appears to be because
        the premise of the comparison was wrong (one being north of the other), not
        because they are at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Murrayville is south of Waitangi and that they are "in different
        hemispheres and on different continents." The NO answer is based on these
        differences, not on equality.

        locations were equal - the model explicitly states that Murrayville is south
        of Waitangi, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on the opposite relationship being true, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis showing
        Murrayville is south of Waitangi, not north of it.

        is logically impossible because a city cannot be north of itself or its metropolitan
        area. This is a different type of reasoning than saying the values are equal.

        logically impossible (a location cannot be north of itself). The model doesn't
        explicitly state the locations are the same/equal as the reason for its NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model does explain that the comparison is
        impossible because a location cannot be north of itself (implying equality
        of position), this is not the same as stating the values are equal/identical/the
        same. The model's reasoning is about logical impossibility rather than equality
        of values. Since equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO
        answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it explains why the comparison is logically impossible.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

        is north of Maibara)" which indicates it cannot determine the relationship.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify or determine
        the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9789bd54-23b4-48eb-a533-077faca7b79d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine one location's
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot determine the location of one place, making it unable
        to verify the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as per the
        criteria "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison."

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one location's
        position at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm the
        location of Beit Yashout)" - this is explicitly stating it cannot determine
        the comparison, which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN. The NO is qualified
        with an inability to verify/determine.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply couldn't locate one of
        the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm it is north
        of Maibara)" and explains it cannot determine the location relationship due
        to uncertainty about Beit Yashout's location. This is a case where the model
        explicitly states it cannot make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN
        rather than a NO comparative result.

        based on equal values - it indicated it couldn't make the comparison at all
        due to insufficient information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm...)" which
        indicates it cannot determine the relationship, rather than making a comparative
        conclusion. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify
        the comparison due to incomplete information about one location.

        are north of Rothera while other parts are south of it. This indicates a varying

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determined
        Hummelo is "further north" than Stanton, not because the locations are at
        the same latitude. It explicitly states there is a difference in position.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that "Hummelo is actually
        further north than Stanton," indicating a difference in latitude. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not equality.

        locations have different positions (Hummelo being north of Stanton), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "So the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that Hummelo is north of Stanton
        ("Hummelo is actually north of Stanton, not the other way around"). The NO
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any value comparisons
        in the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical - rather, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be south of the other, indicating a
        difference in position
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional reason (that

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Prathipadu
        is located south of Uppalapadu"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its geographical analysis that Prathipadu is south (not north) of Uppalapadu.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (south vs north), not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly states there is a difference in relative position, with one
        being south of the other.

        the locations were equal/same/identical - rather, it was because one location
        was explicitly stated to be south of the other. The NO was based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Prathipadu is south of Uppalapadu, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a stated directional
        difference (one location being south of the other), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
