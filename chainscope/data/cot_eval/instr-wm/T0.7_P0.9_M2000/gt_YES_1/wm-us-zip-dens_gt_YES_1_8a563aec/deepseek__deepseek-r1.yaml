      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values for the
        population densities (714 people/sq. mile vs 5,000 people/sq. mile) and states
        NO because 14513 has a higher density. The NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 27301, NC is not more
        densely populated than 14513, NY" as its final conclusion after comparing
        the population densities. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        density values (80 vs 257 people/sq mi), not because the values were equal.
        The model explicitly stated that one area was less densely populated than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 27301, NC
        is less densely populated than 14513, NY" after calculating specific density
        values (80 people/sq mi vs 257 people/sq mi)

    76e538ba-7c5f-40ce-a7e1-93ea01afcbe8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model does careful analysis, it concludes
        NO because it found different density values (1,360/sq mi vs 5,909/sq mi)
        with 14513 being more dense. The values are explicitly different, not equal,
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that "14513,
        NY is more densely populated than 27301, NC". The answer is a direct comparative
        response to whether 27301 is more densely populated than 14513.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values for the
        population densities (~563 people/sq mi vs ~5,909 people/sq mi) and states
        East Rochester's density is "significantly higher." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 27301, NC is not more
        densely populated than 14513, NY" as its final answer after comparing the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because 73018 has a higher
        density (37.5 people/sq mi) than 63628 (13.7 people/sq mi), not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in density
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that 73018 has higher density (37.5 people/sq mi) than
        63628 (13.7 people/sq mi)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2a896f72-b65e-4b5c-8b39-5ca2aa63511d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values for the population densities (~30-40 people/sq mi for Ironton vs ~700-1,500
        people/sq mi for Edmond), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly
        states that Edmond is "significantly more densely populated" than Ironton.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion that 73018 (Edmond) is more densely
        populated than 63628 (Ironton), not the other way around.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5d492977-dbe0-4665-bd00-889d47777b94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant
        difference in density, with 73018 being "significantly more densely populated"
        than 63628 (estimating ~1,000-2,000/sq mi vs ~40/sq mi). The NO is based on
        this difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion that 63628 is not more densely populated
        than 73018. The answer is explicitly stated both in the thinking process and
        final structured response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    616a7aaf-9ad1-4352-a061-2f680afca3ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        clear numerical support for its answer, stating that 63628 (1,143 people/sq
        mile) is more densely populated than 73018 (714 people/sq mile).
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6b889203-666f-472a-8113-bc52f7edf9d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Cashion, OK (73018)
        has a higher density (~16-40 people/sq mi) compared to Centerville, MO (63628)
        (~5-15 people/sq mi). The NO was based on this difference in values, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that 63628, MO is not more densely
        populated than 73018, OK. The answer is explicit and comparative, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a "significant difference" between the densities (27 vs 1,484 people/sq
        mi) rather than stating they are equal. The NO is because 73018 has a higher
        density, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 63628, MO is not more
        densely populated than 73018, OK" as its final answer, providing specific
        density calculations showing 27 people/sq mi vs 1,484 people/sq mi.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, stating "YES, 63628, MO has a higher population density
        than 73018, OK."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b8947c3f-db38-4a5a-84ed-564ac0779c0b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (35.7 vs 281.2 people
        per square mile) and explicitly states they are "significantly lower" rather
        than equal. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly concludes
        that "63628, MO is not more densely populated than 73018, OK" with specific
        density values to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f09fddc3-b3a9-445e-bf7a-481dd8422e8e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly estimates different values for the two locations (63628
        at ~4 people/sq mi vs 73018 at ~800 people/sq mi) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on 73018 having higher density
        than 63628, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 63628, MO is not more
        densely populated than 73018, OK" as its final comparative answer. This is
        a direct NO response to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific density values, it
        clearly shows that the values are different (3,500/sq mi vs 4,310/sq mi) and

        density than 55805, MN, noting that "Chula Vista's overall population density
        (~4,500/sq mi) far exceeds Duluth's (~1,200/sq mi)" and concludes that 91911
        is more densely populated. The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that 55805, MN is not more densely populated than 91911,

        noting that Chula Vista has ~4,000 people/sq mi while Duluth has ~1,200 people/sq
        mi, and expects the specific zip codes to follow a similar pattern. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.

        both locations (2,059/sq mi vs 2,380/sq mi), it concludes NO because Dedham's
        density exceeds Burr Ridge's, not because they are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a difference in density values, with Dedham being higher.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that 60515 is not more

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (1,400/sq mi vs 2,380/sq mi) and concluded NO because Dedham's density
        is higher than Burr Ridge's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that Dedham's density is higher, making 60515
        not more densely populated than 02026. The answer is explicitly stated and

        vs 2,432 people per square mile) and concluded NO because the first value
        was less than the second
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        were the reason for such an answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        final YES/NO answer. Throughout the text, the model oscillates between different
        possibilities, considers various data points and approaches, but never reaches
        a definitive conclusion. The last complete thought shows the model is still

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly calculates different density values
        (17,857/sq mi vs 54,615/sq mi) and states that "11360 has a significantly
        higher population density." The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific calculations showing 11360 has higher
        density (54,615/sq mi) than 60653 (17,857/sq mi). This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response after comparing the population densities of the two zip
        codes and concluding that 60653 is more densely populated than 11360.'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and stated
        "Answer: YES. 60653, IL is more densely populated than 11360, NY." The answer
        was clear and direct.'

    b448c25c-1be2-4101-a9c0-f91b134125e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 11360, NY has a
        "significantly higher population density" (45,454/sq mi vs 18,461/sq mi).
        The NO answer was given because one value was larger than the other, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with a comparative analysis showing 11360, NY has higher
        density (45,454/sq mi) than 60653, IL (18,461/sq mi). This is a direct comparative
        NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at NO as its final answer,
        it's not because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a significant difference between the densities (10.5 vs 1,088 people per
        square mile), with 59301 being "way more dense" than 79022.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that 59301 is "way more dense" than 79022 based
        on specific density calculations (10.5 vs 1,088 people per square mile).
      final_answer: 'NO'

    2134cd05-53f8-4b16-81a2-0f5b7600e239:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - instead,
        it explicitly found that 59301 MT has higher density (~1,585 people/sq mi
        for the city proper) compared to 79022 TX (~2 people/sq mi). The NO answer
        was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 79022, TX
        is less densely populated than 59301, MT." This is a clear comparative NO
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    66eea1c2-d3dc-42ab-8bc2-7197d2164b54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (667/sq mi vs 2,625/sq mi) and stated that 79022 is "less densely populated"
        than 59301.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 79022, TX is less densely
        populated than 59301, MT" as its final answer, providing specific density
        calculations showing 79022 has 667/sq mi while 59301 has 2,625/sq mi.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative answer stating "YES, 79022, TX is more densely populated
        than 59301, MT" after calculating and comparing population densities (1,023.5
        vs 831.6 people/sq mi)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal
        values consideration doesn't come into play since we don't have a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        final YES/NO answer. While there is some indication the model was leaning
        towards YES ("So the answer is likely YES"), it then starts reconsidering
        ("Wait, let me think again") and cuts off before reaching a conclusion. Therefore,
        no clear final answer was given.

      result: UNKNOWN
    b4e2fdc7-e546-4637-9566-11824d5adc90:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values for both zip
        codes (1 person/sq mi vs 168 people/sq mi), it explicitly states there is
        a "significantly higher population density" in 59301, MT. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that 79022, TX is not more densely populated than
        59301, MT. The model provides specific calculations and reaches a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer about which zip code is more densely populated.
        It repeatedly considers different scenarios and possibilities but ultimately
        doesn't commit to a conclusion, showing uncertainty throughout ("But I'm not
        sure", "This is getting confusing", etc.).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 59301 (40-160 people
        per square mile) has a higher density than 79022 (0.2 people per square mile).
        The NO answer was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 79022, TX,

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values
        (98 vs 773 people per square mile) and concludes NO because 56374 has a higher
        density than 12578. The values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 12578 is not more densely
        populated than 56374, supported with specific density calculations (98 vs

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different values (849
        vs 2,648 people per square mile) and stated that one was less dense than the
        other. The NO indicates that the first location is not more dense than the
        second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        numerical comparisons showing 01778 (849 people/sq mile) is less dense than
        92253 (2,648 people/sq mile). The answer is unambiguous and comparative.

        mi) and explicitly states that 75180 is "less densely populated" than 63033.
        The NO is not due to equal values, but rather due to a clear difference where
        one is less than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 75180, TX is less densely
        populated than 63033, MO" as its final comparative answer. This is a direct

        based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model considers multiple scenarios and keeps
        changing its mind, ending mid-thought without providing a final answer. While

        50 people per sq mi for 01520 vs 2,000 per sq mi for 77365) and concludes
        NO because the Texas zip code has a higher density than the Massachusetts
        one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 77365,

        fact, it explicitly states that Hardwick, MA "has significantly lower population
        density than suburban Conroe, TX" and provides different density estimates
        (~111 people/sq mi for MA vs "exceed 1,000 people/sq mi" for TX). The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 01520 is not more

    f6291320-8565-49b8-adef-01ddb426698e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density values (75
        people/sq mi vs 2,608 people/sq mi) and stated there was a "significant difference"
        between them. The NO was because Spring, TX was found to have higher density
        than Hardwick, MA.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct comparative answer that 01520 is not more

    2ac2157c-c0ad-4719-8ee3-b514db4f7f6f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it actually calculated
        different values for the population densities (3,571/sq mi vs 2,222/sq mi)
        and explicitly stated that "58103 is more densely populated than 80031". The
        NO answer appears to contradict the model's own calculations and reasoning,
        but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency. Since
        the model clearly stated different values and did not cite equality as the
        reason for its NO answer, this must be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the immediate response after thinking and in the final conclusion.
        This is a clear, direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4b60e5fd-19dc-426a-ac42-bb0bc7d849d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The question of equal values is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-sentence)
        and never provides a clear final YES/NO answer. While it explores various
        scenarios and data points, it keeps presenting alternatives and contradicting
        possibilities without settling on a definitive conclusion. The last complete
        thought suggests 80031 has higher density but then immediately adds "Alternatively,
        if in reality 58103's density is higher, the answer would be YES."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is only relevant for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "ANSWER: YES"
        after its analysis, indicating that 58103, ND is more densely populated than
        80031, CO. The answer was clearly stated and definitive.'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the population densities (4,500 vs 3,800 people
        per square mile) and considering the urban vs suburban nature of the areas.

    75ebd0eb-5b21-4ad4-89b2-639fc37d9b9e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer to the comparison. It continues to
        consider various possibilities and alternatives until the end, without reaching
        a definitive conclusion. The response ends abruptly while still considering
        possibilities ("Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that 80031 is the zip
        code for the Denver International Airport area").

    78fb6b25-4794-4acf-99b8-7911a11fead1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (2,946 people/sq mi for 58103 vs 4,185 people/sq mi for 80031) and
        concluded NO because 80031 has higher density. The values were clearly different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides specific numerical comparisons showing 80031 has
        higher density than 58103. This is a direct comparative NO answer, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a43552fb-1a4a-4613-bea6-cd5c974f8b22:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that 80031 (Denver
        suburbs) has a higher density (3,000-4,000 people/sq mi) compared to 58103
        in Fargo (~2,500 people/sq mi). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities, concluding that 80031 is likely
        more densely populated than 58103.

        values for the population densities (4,711 people/sq mi vs 5,546 people/sq
        mi) and explicitly stating that 80031 is more dense. The NO is not due to
        equal values but rather because one value is larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, 58103,
        ND is not more densely populated than 80031, CO" as its final answer after
        calculating and comparing the population densities.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states different density values (1,300 people/sq mi for
        Petersburg/23803 vs 1,875 people/sq mi for Strongsville/44141) and uses this
        difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        best case of 2,130/sq mi), showing a clear difference between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities, concluding that 44141's density
        (3,137/sq mi) is higher than 23803's density (767-2,130/sq mi).

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density values (1,900/sq
        mi vs 4,878/sq mi) and stated "44141, OH has a significantly higher population
        density." The NO answer was based on 44141 having higher density, not equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

        that one exceeds the other. The NO answer is based on 44141 having higher
        density than 23803, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that 44141's density (~3,610/sq

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (11,714 people/sq mi for 11234 vs 29,524 people/sq mi for 90016) and
        stated that "90016 has a significantly higher population density than 11234."
        The NO indicates that the first location is less dense than the second, not
        that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion that "NO, 11234, NY is less densely populated
        than 90016, CA." The answer is explicitly stated and supported with specific

        it shows different values (25,000-30,000 vs 35,000-40,000 people per square
        mile) rather than equal values. The NO answer is based on 90016 having higher
        density than 11234, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, supported by specific density estimates showing
        90016 having higher density than 11234. The answer is definitive and directly
        addresses the comparison.

    aae047f0-fde1-4a5d-9149-0d70a8a97a0a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states there is a significant difference between the densities
        (33,600/sq mi vs 19,500/sq mi) and uses this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. The NO is because 90016 has higher density, not because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "11234, NY is less densely
        populated than 90016, CA." The answer is explicitly stated and used as a comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different values
        (23,300/sq mi for 11234 vs 41,600/sq mi for 90016) and stated that "90016
        has a significantly higher population density."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear comparative answer that 11234 is not more densely populated than 90016,
        supported by specific density calculations showing 90016 has higher density

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discussed various possible population
        density values throughout its reasoning, it did not conclude NO because the
        values were equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it estimated 90016 had
        a higher density (e.g., "90016 is 1 square mile with 25,000 people (25k/sq
        mi), Then 90016 is denser"). The model consistently suggested one area had
        a higher density than the other, not that they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, followed by beginning to explain its reasoning. The answer
        was given as a direct response to the comparison question, not as an inability
        to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal - it explicitly shows that 19145 has a higher
        density (26,646) than 90032 (17,724). The NO is because 90032 is less dense
        than 19145, not because they are equal.

        difference between the two densities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        numerical values showing that 90032's density (22,525 people/sq mi) is lower

        never gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various scenarios and calculations
        but never actually provides a definitive YES/NO answer to the comparison.
        While it suggests different possible calculations (18,750 vs 40,000 per square
        mile, or 18k vs 25k), it consistently emphasizes these are guesses and that
        it needs "actual numbers." The response ends without making a final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values for both ZIP
        codes (81 people/sq mi vs 529 people/sq mi), it does not state they are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states they are different, with 18011 having a higher
        density. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 18011
        has a higher population density than 15332.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different values (48
        vs 1,788 people per square mile) and stated that 18011 is "much denser" than
        15332.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific population density calculations showing
        15332 (48 people/sq mi) is less dense than 18011 (1,788 people/sq mi).

        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after its reasoning and in the formal conclusion. This
        NO is a direct comparative result indicating that 77389 is not more densely

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. It continues to consider alternatives
        and possibilities until the response cuts off, without making a definitive

        values (4,285 people/sq mi for 77003 vs 1,000 people/sq mi for 77407) and
        concluded NO because 77003's density was higher
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with specific density calculations showing 77407 is not
        more densely populated than 77003 (1,000 vs 4,285 people/sq mi)

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in density, with 77003 having approximately 10,000/sq mi and 77407 having
        approximately 1,666/sq mi. The NO answer is because 77407 has lower (not equal)
        density than 77003.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion

        it never states that the values are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        argues that 77003 has "higher density" and "greater density" than 77407, giving
        specific examples of how 77003 would have higher density (5,000 per sq mi)
        compared to 77407 (1,000 per sq mi). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both after its thinking process and in its final formatted answer. The model
        provides a definitive comparative answer indicating that 77407 is not more
        densely populated than 77003.

        for both zip codes (1,400 per square mile for 77407 vs 12,000 per square mile
        for 77003), it clearly indicated a difference between them rather than equality.
        The NO answer was based on 77407 having a lower density than 77003, not because
        the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that 77407 is not more densely populated than 77003,
        with specific reasoning about the suburban vs urban nature of these areas
        and their respective population densities.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with 77003 having "significantly
        higher population density" (~4,000 people per square mile vs ~1,500 people
        per square mile for 77407). The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        fact, it explicitly calculates different density values (5,000 people/sq mi
        for 77003 vs 2,000 people/sq mi for 77407) and uses this difference as the
        basis for its NO answer. The NO is based on 77407 having lower density than
        77003, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that "77407, TX is less densely
        populated than 77003, TX." The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the population densities were equal. Instead, it explicitly described
        differences between the areas, stating that 77003 has higher density due to
        being in the urban core with high-rise developments, while 77407 is suburban
        with lower density due to single-family homes and larger lot sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that 77407 is not more densely populated than 77003. This is a
        clear comparative answer without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

        the last partial statement suggests it was heading toward "NO, 31408, GA is
        more densely populated than..." However, since the response is incomplete
        and no definitive YES/NO answer was actually given, we must classify this
        as UNKNOWN. The model spent most of the time considering various scenarios

        Instead, it explicitly calculates different density values (676/sq mi for
        48075 vs 3,000/sq mi for 32751) and says NO because 32751 has a higher density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 32751, FL is more
        densely populated." This is a clear NO answer to whether 48075 is more densely
        populated than 32751.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Plano (75076) has a higher density
        (~4,000/sq mi) compared to Suffolk (23430) (~300/sq mi). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that 23430 VA is not more densely populated than

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes differences, stating that 75076 in
        Plano is "significantly denser" than 23430 in Suffolk, with specific different
        density values mentioned (~219 people/sq mi vs ~3,900 people/sq mi). The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a final bolded "Answer: NO" indicating that 23430, VA is not more

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific density numbers
        for comparison (225 people/sq mi for Suffolk vs 4,000 people/sq mi for Plano),
        it does not state that the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes
        that one area has a higher density than the other. The NO answer is based
        on finding that 75076, TX has a higher density, not that the densities are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both after its
        thinking process and in its final summary. It definitively concludes that
        23430, VA is not more densely populated than 75076, TX, providing specific
        density numbers to support this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - instead,
        it explicitly states different density values for each location (Suffolk ~200-300
        people/sq mi vs Frisco ~1,500-2,500 people/sq mi) and uses this difference
        to conclude NO. The NO answer is based on 75076 having higher density than
        23430, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 23430, VA is not more
        densely populated than 75076, TX" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes 75076, TX has higher
        density than 23430, VA (citing Plano's higher average density of ~4,000/sq
        mi vs Virginia Beach's ~1,800/sq mi). The NO is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that 75076, TX likely has greater population density than
        23430, VA. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

        the response does discuss some cases where the values might be equal, this
        is irrelevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear final YES/NO answer. While it discusses various possibilities and mentions
        "if those numbers are accurate, then the answer would be NO," this is presented
        as hypothetical and the model never makes a definitive conclusion. The response
        shows uncertainty throughout and ends without resolution.

        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer, both in the main response and in the step-by-step explanation.
        The model provides a definitive comparative conclusion that 27576, NC is more

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it calculated different
        density values for the two locations (933 people/sq mi for Zebulon vs 1,500
        people/sq mi for Durant) and found that Durant had higher density. The NO
        was not due to equal values, but rather because the comparison showed a difference
        opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model initially gave a YES answer after the thinking
        section, but then provided a "Final Answer: NO" after calculating specific
        density values and realizing its initial assumption was wrong. Since the model

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, comparing the population
        densities of the two zip codes and determining that 27576 (Zebulon, NC) is

        The model never reached a final comparative conclusion, so we cannot evaluate
        if equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-calculation without providing
        a final YES/NO answer. While the model explores various scenarios and calculations,
        it never reaches a definitive conclusion about which zip code is more densely
        populated. The response cuts off while still analyzing the data.

        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-sentence, but in the
        preceding analysis, it clearly states "So I think the answer is YES" and "based
        on this reasoning, the answer is YES." The model arrives at this conclusion
        after analyzing various scenarios and settling on population density figures

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (5,838 people/sq mi vs 15,972 people/sq mi) and concluded that 32814
        is less densely populated than 20032. The NO was due to this difference in
        values, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 32814, FL is less densely
        populated than 20032, DC" as its final answer. This is a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states that 20032, DC has a "significantly higher population
        density" (~8,000-12,000 people per square mile) compared to 32814, FL (~2,000-3,000
        people per square mile). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains its comparative reasoning that 32814 is not more densely
        populated than 20032, providing specific density estimates for both locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly argues that 20032 in DC has higher density
        than 32814 in FL, citing reasons like urban development patterns, housing
        types (row houses vs single-family homes), and typical density patterns in
        DC vs suburban Florida. While exact numbers aren't provided, the model clearly
        indicates a difference in density levels, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in bold at the end of the response. This is a clear comparative
        conclusion stating that 32814 is not more densely populated than 20032.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly states different values, estimating "20032 likely has a density
        of ~15,000 people/sq mi, whereas 32814 might be ~4,000 people/sq mi" and concludes
        NO because 20032 is more densely populated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that 20032
        DC is more densely populated than 32814 FL.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference between the two densities (2,463 vs 18,318 people per square mile),
        with 20032 DC being "much more densely populated."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly compares the population densities, concluding that 32814 FL
        is not more densely populated than 20032 DC. The answer is direct and comparative.

        DC to be more densely populated (20,000/sq mi) than 32814 FL (4,444/sq mi),
        not because the values were equal. It explicitly states "20032 has a significantly
        higher population density"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by specific calculations showing 20032 has higher density (20,000/sq

        the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly stated different values
        for the two zip codes, with 20032 having approximately 12,000-15,000 people
        per square mile and 32814 having about 3,000 people per square mile.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-sentence, but
        in the preceding analysis and partial conclusion, it clearly indicates that
        32814 has lower density (3,000 per sq mile) compared to 20032 (12,000-15,000
        per sq mile). The direction of comparison and implied "NO" answer is clear

        its NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        compared to 32814 (~3,000 people/sq mi).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a final structured answer with "NO" as the conclusion, comparing the density
        values of ~3,000 people/sq mi for 32814 vs ~13,333 people/sq mi for 20032.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that 20032, DC has
        a higher density than 32814, FL, noting that "DC's urban ZIP codes typically
        outpace Orlando's suburban areas in density." The NO answer is based on this
        difference in density, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative judgment that 32814, FL is not more densely populated
        than 20032, DC. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes the NJ zip code has
        a higher density than the TX zip code ("NJ zip code likely has higher density
        due to its coastal, compact geography"). The model specifically argues for
        a difference in densities, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various scenarios and calculations,
        it never reaches a definitive answer, instead presenting multiple possibilities
        ("if...then YES" vs "if...then NO") without choosing between them.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c42f9e76-8e82-4e2e-83b1-e882b12d181e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 50013 has a higher
        density (5,052 people/sq mi) than 02746 (3,613 people/sq mi). The NO was due
        to this difference in values, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        numerical evidence that 02746 (3,613 people/sq mi) is less dense than 50013
        (5,052 people/sq mi). This is a direct comparative answer to the original
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        gives a clear final YES/NO answer. While it suggests "NO" several times, it
        consistently follows these with doubts and alternative scenarios. The response
        ends with "Alternatively, if the zip code 50013 covers a larger area..." without
        making a final determination.

        fact, it explicitly calculates different values (5,333/sq mi for 30033 and
        6,000/sq mi for 36604) and states that "36604's smaller area results in higher
        density." The NO answer is based on 36604 having a higher density, not on
        the values being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Even if we considered
        the model's leanings toward NO in its reasoning, it was suggesting differences
        in density rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, ending mid-sentence
        with "we compare their population". While the model seems to lean towards
        NO in its reasoning near the end ("So the answer would be NO, 02864 is more
        densely populated"), it never provides a clear final answer. The response
        ends before a conclusion is stated.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at NO, it does not base this
        on the values being equal. Instead, it suggests that 02864 is more densely
        populated, citing factors like Rhode Island's overall higher density and Newport
        being a compact city. The model compares different values (not equal ones)
        throughout its analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO, 78260 is not more densely populated than 02864" after its reasoning
        process.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        values for the population densities (4,571/sq mi vs 5,714/sq mi), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that Newport's 02864 "has
        a higher density than San Antonio's suburban 78260."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities, concluding that 78260 is not more
        densely populated than 02864.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it concludes that 02864 likely has higher density than
        78260 due to Newport's compact urban structure and Rhode Island's overall
        density trends. The model suggests a difference in values (with Newport being
        higher), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 78260 is not more

    81a11f82-e8f6-4ba4-ab17-9e2e18aa4fc8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we were to consider the NO statement that appears in the middle of the reasoning,
        it wasn't based on equal values but rather on comparing different density
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive back-and-forth reasoning
        but never arrives at a clear final answer. The last complete thought ends
        with "But if it's lower, then YES" followed by an incomplete "Alternatively,
        if 28278 covers". The model considers both possibilities multiple times but
        doesn't make a final determination. While it briefly states "NO" and "YES"
        at different points in its reasoning, there is no clear final conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        concludes NO because 28278 has a higher density, not because they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        it found 28278 has a higher density (2,003) than 48167 (1,320), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly shows this difference in values
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific density calculations showing 28278 has higher
        density (2,003 people/sq mi) than 48167 (1,320 people/sq mi).

        values (1,666 people/sq mi for 48167 vs 2,941 people/sq mi for 28278) and
        concluded NO because 28278 has a higher density.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 48167 is not more

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the population densities
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly calculates different values (1,657/sq mi
        for 48167 vs 2,500/sq mi for 28278) and states that 28278 "has a higher population
        density." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 48167 is not more densely populated
        than 28278. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        the model does discuss some scenarios where values might be equal, this is
        irrelevant since we didn't get a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear final answer. While it considers both YES and NO at different
        points, it ends with "Alternatively, maybe..." without making a definitive
        conclusion. The response shows uncertainty and presents multiple conflicting

        for 29152 vs ~4,000 people/sq mi for 36830) and states "Auburn's density is
        significantly higher." The NO answer is given because Auburn (36830) has higher
        density, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, both after its thinking process and in its final formatted answer.

        (70 people/sq mi vs 5,000 people/sq mi) and describes 80007 as "significantly
        higher" than 95961. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 90066 (20,000-25,000
        people per square mile) is "significantly more densely populated" than 19023
        (3,000-4,000 people per square mile). The NO is based on this difference in

        between the areas, calculating approximately 2,000 people/sq mi for 19023
        vs 13,300 people/sq mi for 90066. The NO is because 90066 is "significantly
        more densely populated."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. 90066, CA is significantly

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different values (5,472
        vs 16,818 people per square mile) and stated that one area was less dense
        than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer and reinforces this with specific numerical comparisons showing
        19023 (5,472 people/sq mi) is less dense than 90066 (16,818 people/sq mi)

        two areas, with 90066 having "significantly higher density." The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the two zip codes, concluding that 19023 PA is not more densely

        the areas, estimating ~12,000 people/sq mi for 90066 vs ~4,000 people/sq mi
        for 19023. The NO answer is based on 90066 having higher density than 19023,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, both after the thinking process and in the final structured answer.

        based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is a long exploration of possibilities
        but never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. While it ends with "If that's
        the case, then 48082 would have a higher density", this is a hypothetical
        statement and the response appears to be cut off mid-thought. The model never

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.

        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative answer stating that 17602, PA is more densely populated
        than 08054, NJ, supported by specific density numbers (7,900/sq mi vs 6,500/sq

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model calculates similar densities (2,812/sq
        mi vs 2,916/sq mi), it explicitly states that 32258, FL has a "slightly higher
        density" than 84341, UT. Since the model notes this difference (even though
        small) rather than stating they are equal, this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that 32258, FL has a higher density
        than 84341, UT.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a large
        difference between the densities (34 people/sq mi vs 4,523 people/sq mi),
        describing this as "vastly higher" and "way more densely populated." The NO
        is because 84341 has LOWER (not equal) density than 32258.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that 84341 is NOT more
        densely populated than 32258. The model provides specific calculations and
        a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that 32258
        FL is significantly denser (~4,167 people/sq mi) than 84341 UT (~1,200 people/sq
        mi), not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in density values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Jacksonville's 32258 is more dense

        (1,636/sq mi vs 2,857/sq mi), it explicitly shows they are different values,
        with 32258 having a higher density. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

        different values for the population densities (295 vs 3,200 people/sq mi)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not
        equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 84341, UT is not more
        densely populated than 32258, FL" as its final answer, providing specific

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 32258, FL has higher
        density than 84341, UT, describing one as "rural areas near Tremonton, Utah,
        characterized by agricultural land and low population density" and the other
        as "suburban area in Jacksonville, Florida, with residential neighborhoods
        and typical urban-suburban density." The NO is based on this difference in
        values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the population densities
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly estimates different values (e.g., "40/sq
        mi" vs "1,000/sq mi") and concludes that the Florida zip code has higher density
        than the Utah one. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that 84341 is not more densely

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values for the population densities - specifically stating that 32258, FL
        has ~4,285 people per square mile while 84341, UT has ~1,785 people per square
        mile. The NO was not due to equal values, but because one value was explicitly
        lower than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 84341, UT is not more
        densely populated than 32258, FL" as its final conclusion after comparing
        estimated population densities.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a significant
        difference between the densities (29 vs 3,023 people per square mile) and
        uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that 32258, FL is more densely populated than 84341,
        UT, with specific density values (29 vs 3,023 people per square mile).

        two zip codes (300 people per square mile vs 5,000 people per square mile)
        and states the Florida zip code has a "significantly higher" population density.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities, with no ambiguity or qualification
        about inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - instead,
        it explicitly states that 11214 has higher density than 11355, citing specific
        differences like "11214's residential layout of tightly packed low-rise buildings
        and smaller land area contributes to a higher population density compared
        to 11355." The NO answer is based on 11214 being more dense, not on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that 11214 is more densely populated than 11355, making
        this an explicit NO answer to whether 11355 is more densely populated than

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (5,322/sq mi vs 8,800/sq mi) and concluded that 98023 has a lower density

        some potential numbers, it never arrives at a definitive answer. The last
        complete thought suggests "If I recall correctly that 98023 has a higher density...

        is described as having higher density, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the reasoning and in the bold conclusion. This NO is given as a direct

        final answer, followed by a detailed explanation comparing the population
        densities (6,454 vs 778 people per square mile) showing that 92145 is less
        densely populated than 17901.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5da4a4f1-b464-44fc-abc7-fe4f5e3b37b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - instead,
        it explicitly gives different density ranges for each location (2,000-3,000
        people per square mile for 92145 vs 3,500-4,500 people per square mile for
        17901) and concludes NO because 17901 has a higher density than 92145.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. It continues to weigh different possibilities
        and scenarios, expressing uncertainty throughout ("This is tricky without
        exact data"). The response ends mid-thought without providing a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions. The equal
        values criteria only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "YES, 92145 is more densely
        populated" based on recalled density values of 2,500 people/sq mile for 92145
        vs 1,400 people/sq mile for 17901. Despite earlier uncertainty and alternative
        scenarios, the final explicit answer is YES.

        explicitly states that 17901 has a higher density (~2,830) than 92145 (~651).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides specific
        numerical comparisons showing 92145 has lower density (~651) than 17901 (~2,830),
        making this a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never actually gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        was due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought and never provides
        a clear YES/NO answer to the comparison. While it makes various calculations
        and estimates, it doesn't reach a definitive conclusion about which ZIP code
        is more densely populated. The response shows uncertainty and multiple "alternatively"
        scenarios without settling on a final answer.

        vs 5,000 people/sq mi) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        The NO is because the first location has a lower density than the second,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 03246, NH is not more
        densely populated than 64129, MO" as its final comparative conclusion. This
        is a direct NO answer to whether the first location is more densely populated

        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both after the

        density" while 64129 has a "higher density," describing a clear difference
        between the two values. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that 03246 is not more densely populated than

        people/sq mi) and stated "64129 is much more densely populated" as the reason
        for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO, 03246, NH is
        not more densely populated than 64129, MO" and provides specific comparative

        vs 5,000 people/sq mi) and states "64129 is far more densely populated." The
        NO is because 03246 has lower (not equal) density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed comparison showing 64129 is more densely

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (6,571 vs 19,531 people/sq mi) and concluded that 30030 GA is "less
        densely populated" than 07032 NJ.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific calculations showing 30030 GA has lower
        population density (6,571 people/sq mi) than 07032 NJ (19,531 people/sq mi).

    085296cf-917a-420d-9b69-c287af2eaf16:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values for both population
        densities, it does not state they are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes
        "a significant difference" between them (4,130 vs 21,666 people per square
        mile) and states that 07032 has "much higher density." The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the population densities
        of the two zip codes. The answer directly addresses the comparative question
        of whether 30030 is more densely populated than 07032.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific density values for
        both zip codes (2,727/sq mi vs 13,846/sq mi), it explicitly states there is
        a "big difference" between them and that "07032 is way more dense." The NO
        answer is based on a clear difference in values, not on equality. The model
        states that Harrison "has a significantly higher population density."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, both in the thinking process and final formatted answer, concluding
        that 30030 is not more densely populated than 07032. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

    2bbff22b-a8e4-43fa-aea8-9b5a520b0a02:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never made a definitive NO statement based on equal values or any
        other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering alternatives and
        different possibilities without making a final comparative statement. The
        response actually cuts off mid-thought, further indicating no final answer
        was given.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were
        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through calculations and comparisons
        but never actually provides a final YES/NO answer to the comparison. The response
        appears to cut off mid-thought, leaving the conclusion unstated.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    31b03d3f-5a84-4dec-8cfc-5239ceeaf1f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different density values (1,034 people/sq mi vs 14,062 people/sq mi), not
        because the values were equal. It explicitly states that Harrison "has a significantly
        higher population density than Conyers."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion
        that 07032 has higher density than 30030.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-analysis
        without providing a final YES/NO conclusion. The model was working through
        the population density calculations but didn't complete the comparison or
        state a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculates different
        density values (7,143 vs 47,273 people/sq mi) and states that "07032, NJ has
        a significantly higher population density than 30030, GA." The NO is based
        on this significant difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that 30030, GA is not more
        densely populated than 07032, NJ. The model provides specific calculations
        and a definitive comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the values
        are different (2,733/sq mi vs 14,062/sq mi) and states that "07032, NJ is
        far more densely populated than 30030, GA." The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation showing that 30030 is less densely
        populated than 07032. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculates different density
        values (567 people/sq mi vs 14,615 people/sq mi) and states that Harrison,
        NJ has a "significantly higher population density" than Conyers, GA. The NO
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, specifically stating "NO, 30030,
        GA is not more densely populated than 07032, NJ." This is a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually made a NO comparison, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various considerations but
        never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion about which ZIP code is more
        densely populated. It spends time speculating about possible scenarios and
        approximate density figures but ultimately does not make a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it consistently shows 48507 having a higher
        density than 66220 (5,842 vs 2,611 per square mile in the final comparison).
        The NO is because 48507 is more dense, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer would
        be NO, 66220, KS is not more densely populated than 48507, MI" and reinforces
        this with final density numbers showing 48507 as more dense (5,842 vs 2,611
        per square mile). This is a clear NO answer to whether 66220 is more densely

        vs 5,301), it explicitly states that 48507 is "slightly higher" and "slightly
        denser." The NO answer was given because 48507 has a higher density, not because
        the values are equal. Any difference, even if described as "slight," means
        we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model considers multiple scenarios and possibilities,
        repeatedly saying things like "but I'm not sure" and "this is speculative."
        The response ends mid-sentence without providing a final answer. While it
        explores various possibilities (both YES and NO scenarios), it remains uncertain
        throughout.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (2,697 people/sq mi for TX vs 4,084 people/sq mi for MI) and concluded
        NO because the MI location had higher density. The values were clearly different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific calculations showing 48239, MI has higher

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific density values (3,200/sq
        mi vs 4,677/sq mi), it's stating that one value is less than the other, not
        that they are equal. The NO answer is given because 75041 has a lower density
        than 48239, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "75041, TX is less densely populated
        than 48239, MI." This is a clear NO answer to whether 75041 is more densely
        populated than 48239.

        different values for the population densities (~3,500 people/sq mi for 75041
        vs ~5,600 people/sq mi for 48239). The NO is because 48239 has a higher density,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities, with no caveats about uncertainty

        has a lower density (3,467/sq mi) than 48239 (5,630/sq mi). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 75041, TX is less densely
        populated than 48239, MI" as its final answer. It provides specific calculations
        showing 75041 has lower density (3,467/sq mi) compared to 48239 (5,630/sq

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values for both ZIP
        codes (5,277/sq mi vs 15,210/sq mi), it indicates a clear difference between
        them ("48239, MI has a significantly higher population density") rather than
        stating they are equal. The NO answer is based on 48239 having higher density,
        not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density values (3,055
        people/sq mi for 75041 vs 7,435 people/sq mi for 48239) and concluded NO because
        48239 has a higher density than 75041.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thinking and in the formal answer section. It

        there is a significant difference between the densities (40 people per square
        mile vs 889 people per square mile). The NO is not because the values are
        equal, but because one value is clearly larger than the other ("that's a big
        difference"). The model specifically notes that Eden, WI has "significantly
        higher density" than Chilmark, MA.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by a detailed explanation comparing the population

        actually specifies different values (6,666 people/sq mi for 33760 vs 16,666
        people/sq mi for 40502) and states that "40502's density is significantly
        higher." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering alternatives ("Alternatively...")
        and expressing uncertainty ("This is really tricky without data", "I'm torn").

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 40502 has a higher
        density (~10,000+ people per sq mi) than 33760 (~3,000-5,000 people per sq
        mi). The NO is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that "40502,
        KY is more densely populated." This is a direct NO answer to whether 33760
        is more densely populated than 40502.

        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that 02145 is more densely populated than 90028, making
        this an explicit NO answer to whether 90028 is more densely populated than
        02145.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly calculates different values (17,692/sq mi for 90028 vs
        30,000/sq mi for 02145) and states that 02145 has "significantly higher density."
        The NO answer is based on 02145 being more dense than 90028, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities of the two zip codes. The answer
        is given definitively without caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of whether values are equal is not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly with "Therefore" and never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. While the model seems to be leaning towards
        concluding that 02145 is more densely populated, it repeatedly expresses uncertainty
        and provides multiple alternative scenarios without committing to a final
        answer.

        02145 to be MORE densely populated than 90028 (28,500 vs 13,000 people per
        square mile), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states
        there is a difference in density between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer indicating that 90028 is not more densely populated than
        02145, with specific density estimates given (28,500 vs 13,000 people per
        square mile).

        population density while 02472 has positive density (3,000-5,000 people per
        square mile). The NO is based on 77204 having lower (not equal) density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 77204 is not more densely populated

        them ("Bellwood's density is significantly higher"), not that they are equal.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        between the densities, with 03842 having 639 people per square mile and 60404
        having 9,180 people per square mile. The NO was because one value was less

        values (348 people/sq mi vs 9,180 people/sq mi) and stated there was a "huge
        difference" between them. The NO was because one value was significantly larger
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density values (3,333/sq
        mi for 85249 vs 6,250/sq mi for 93901) and concluded that 93901 has a higher
        population density. The NO answer was based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 85249 is not more

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that 93901
        has higher density than 85249, not because they are equal. It specifically
        contrasts Salinas's higher urban density (~6,900/sq mi) with Chandler's lower
        suburban density (~4,000/sq mi). The values are explicitly different, not
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that 93901 (Salinas) is more densely populated than 85249
        (Chandler). This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

        mi) has a higher density than 85249 (3,200 people/sq mi), not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states different values and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.

        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions. The values
        compared were also different (3,472 vs 2,172), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, 24504, VA,
        is more densely populated than 76031, TX" after comparing population densities

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 76031 has a higher
        density than 24504, citing reasons such as "Suburban areas near major cities
        like Dallas-Fort Worth often have higher population densities." The model
        compared different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly concludes
        that "76031 in Texas (Euless) is more densely populated than 24504 in Virginia
        (Lynchburg)." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values
        for the two locations (3,428 people/sq mi vs 5,000 people/sq mi) and indicates
        that 76031 TX has a higher population density than 24504 VA. The NO is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including in its final formatted answer, indicating that 24504 VA is
        not more densely populated than 76031 TX. The model provides specific numerical

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison where
        it concludes that 95826 has higher density than 77503 due to urban vs suburban
        characteristics. It does not state that the densities are equal or the same
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one area "almost certainly has a higher
        population density" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 77503 is not more
        densely populated than 95826.'

    9db9d2fb-a8ca-4fcc-8d01-ff076362f26a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that 95826, CA has a "significantly higher
        population density" than 77503, TX, giving specific different values (4,216/sq
        mi vs 13,333/sq mi). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a direct comparative conclusion that 77503, TX is not more
        densely populated than 95826, CA based on its analysis of population density
        numbers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sidney, IL has a
        "significantly higher population density" and shows specific different values
        (732.7/sq mi vs 1,522.5/sq mi). The NO is because Sidney has higher density,
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides specific numerical comparisons
        showing that 18237, PA is not more densely populated than 61883, IL. The model
        gives specific density calculations: 732.7/sq mi for Tamaqua vs 1,522.5/sq

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equal
        values were mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times
        and concludes with a clear "Answer: YES" after comparing the population densities

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" and confirmed this
        in its conclusion, clearly indicating that zip code 18237 is more densely
        populated than 61883.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    78481050-3a06-486e-a61e-a1c9ce5d6701:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly calculates different density values (707/sq mi vs 1,833/sq
        mi) and states "Thomasboro's density remains significantly higher." The NO
        answer is given because Thomasboro has a higher density, not because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that 18237, PA is not more densely populated
        than 61883, IL. The answer is explicitly stated and used as a comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The values being compared
        were different (4,569 vs 2,086 people/sq mi), but this is irrelevant since
        the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, comparing the population
        densities of the two ZIP codes (4,569 people/sq mi vs 2,086 people/sq mi).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and considers
        many possibilities, it does not base its NO answer on the values being equal.
        Instead, it concludes NO because it believes 61883, IL is MORE densely populated
        than 18237, PA due to being a university area. The model explicitly states
        differences in density values throughout its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" based on reasoning that the Illinois zip code likely has higher
        density due to being a university area. While there is significant uncertainty
        and multiple alternatives considered, the model does provide a clear final
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a06a7212-b41f-43b3-a46d-f688946defbc:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        density values (277 people/sq mi vs 1,318 people/sq mi) and explicitly states
        that "Sidney, IL's density is significantly higher than Nesquehoning, PA's."
        The NO is due to this difference in values, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct comparative answer based on its calculations
        showing Sidney, IL has higher density than Nesquehoning, PA.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrived at a NO answer, it was not
        because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different
        density values (1,000/sq mi for 18237, PA vs 1,465/sq mi for 61883, IL) and
        concluded NO because 61883 was more dense
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative answer that 18237, PA is less densely populated than 61883,
        IL, with specific numerical comparisons (1,000/sq mi vs 1,465/sq mi)

        75205, with specific estimates mentioned (e.g., "89142 is around 4,200" vs
        "75205 is approximately 3,500 people per square mile"). The NO answer is based
        on 89142 having higher density, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, indicating that 75205 is not

        values (302 vs 1,190 people/sq mi) and states that Williamsburg "has a significantly
        higher population density than Rutledge." The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific calculations showing that 37725 (302 people/sq
        mi) is less densely populated than 45176 (1,190 people/sq mi). This is a direct

        density."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        the population densities, stating that Williamsburg, OH (45176) has a significantly
        higher population density than Rutledge, TN (37725).

        are different, with 63301 being "significantly more densely populated." The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities, with a clear comparative conclusion
        that 44139 is not more densely populated than 95762.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    322e3d25-e9bc-4ea7-b6ea-759e1412d241:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        even in the incomplete reasoning, the model was comparing different values
        (1,133 vs 2,143 per square mile), not stating they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-sentence while calculating densities. While the model seems to be leaning
        towards NO in its reasoning (mentioning "Therefore, the answer is NO" multiple
        times), it never provides a clear final answer. The response ends abruptly
        while still doing calculations.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5b014ef7-0e99-427e-8277-08ac23c80440:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly states that 95762 is MORE densely populated than 44139, citing
        differences in housing density patterns between California and Midwest suburbs.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 44139 is not more densely populated than 95762, providing a direct comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5d7001aa-0e6d-4220-bd04-fc2d82db2f0f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative answer stating that 44139 is more densely populated than
        95762, with supporting calculations and reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8d61e92b-541b-4517-99df-f7f25dbaaabd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values for both zip
        codes, it explicitly states that 95762 has a higher density (3,200-3,500)
        than 44139 (2,888). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific numerical comparisons showing 44139 (2,888 people/sq
        mile) is less dense than 95762 (3,200-3,500 people/sq mile)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9ad50e4-645d-4456-89fe-49945bab7254:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the areas have equal density.
        Instead, it explicitly calculates different density values (1,122 people/sq
        mi for 44139 vs ~3,500 people/sq mi for 95762) and states that 95762 has higher
        density. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer with explanation. It concludes that 44139 is less densely
        populated than 95762, making a clear comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9f6d60d-5395-4c0b-b582-2fb151a4cc7d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the densities are equal -
        it explicitly states that one is lower than the other (1,122 vs 3,535 per
        square mile) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that 44139 has lower population density than 95762,
        supported by specific density numbers.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d09b012c-302f-4acb-9d09-5854b7f7fb5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model does extensive analysis, it concludes
        NO because it finds Rocklin (95762) has a higher density (~3,535 people/sq
        mi) than Solon (1,138 people/sq mi). The NO is based on finding a difference
        in values, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a comparative conclusion that 95762, CA
        is more densely populated than 44139, OH. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d94e2400-20c9-49ed-909c-47edd8a66a12:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        doesn't apply since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response after working through various considerations and calculations.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    fa5e56a5-158d-4f83-8ba6-5a02e3e8ccfc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Even if we were to
        consider the tentative "NO" statements in the reasoning, these were based
        on perceived differences in density values (1,200 vs 3,500 per square mile),
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model appears to reach a tentative "NO" conclusion
        multiple times in its reasoning, stating "Therefore, 95762 is more dense.
        So the answer is NO, 44139 is not more densely populated than 95762." However,
        it then continues to question this conclusion and raises more uncertainties.
        The response ends mid-sentence without providing a final, definitive answer.
        Given the lack of a clear final conclusion, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
