      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explained that they
        are on "opposite sides of the world" and that the comparison "doesn't make

        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifiers that would make it an UNKNOWN (like "cannot verify"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it concludes NO because the locations are on opposite
        sides of the globe, implying a different reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        or the same - instead, it gives a directional explanation that one is in Central
        America and the other in Southeast Asia. The NO answer is based on their relative
        positions being different, not on them being equal.

        equal latitude or have the same north/south position. Instead, it explains
        that Lake Izabal is west of the Zambales Mountains, indicating a different
        relative position. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Izabal is not
        located north of the Zambales Mountains" as its conclusion. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        in latitude/position. Instead, it explains that they are on opposite sides
        of the globe and concludes NO based on their relative positions being incompatible
        with one location being north of the other. The NO is not due to equal positions.

    b096edb8-540f-4862-b6d9-7c96141cd8d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        having equal values - rather, it states they are in "completely different
        parts of the world" and that the comparison "doesn't make sense" due to being
        on different continents. This is a rejection of the comparison's meaningfulness,
        not an assertion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion, though it explains this is due to the locations being in different
        continents making the comparison not meaningful.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant to
        consider since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Lake Izabal is located

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model argues that the comparison isn't meaningful
        due to the locations being in different parts of the world, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same in terms of latitude. Instead, it
        gives a different reason for its NO answer (that they are in entirely different
        regions). Therefore, equality is not the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result, even though it argues the comparison
        isn't meaningful. Since it gives a definitive NO rather than saying it cannot
        determine the answer, this counts as a NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it specifically states they are different, with the Stansbury Mountains
        being west of Lake Boyukshor. The NO answer is given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and presents it as a clear comparative conclusion based on geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it explained
        that they are in "entirely different parts of the world" and that the comparison
        doesn't make sense due to being on "opposite sides of the world." The NO answer
        was based on the meaningfulness of the comparison, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its conclusion,
        providing a clear comparative answer, even though it qualifies this by explaining
        the comparison isn't meaningful due to the locations being in different parts
        of the world. Since it still provides a definitive NO answer, we classify
        this as NO rather than REFUSED or UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal coordinates or values. Instead, the reason given
        was that they are "in a different part of the world entirely" and "in entirely
        different hemispheres and continents." The model does not state or imply the
        locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result, even though it explains this is due
        to the locations being in different parts of the world.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that
        they are "on opposite sides of the world" and that the comparison doesn't
        make sense due to being in different regions. The NO is based on the meaningfulness
        of the comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that the comparison doesn't make sense due to the locations
        being in different regions, it still provides a clear NO rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains they are in different continents and separated
        by thousands of miles. The NO answer is based on the argument that the comparison
        doesn't make sense due to their distant locations, not because they are at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was based on their
        being on different continents and having "vast geographical distance between
        these two locations." The model indicates it's impossible for one to be north
        of the other "in any meaningful sense" due to their distinct locations, not
        because they share the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as a final standalone answer. The model
        provides a definitive comparative answer, not indicating inability to determine
        or equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated they were "in completely
        different parts of the world."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning given suggests it's rejecting the premise of the comparison
        ("doesn't make sense to compare their relative north-south positions"). When
        a model rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        is a difference in position, saying Larne Lough is "slightly south" of Lough
        Beg. Any difference in position, even if described as "slight," means this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        saying Gazivoda Lake "is to the east and slightly south" of the Basque Mountains.
        Even though this is given as the reason for the NO answer, the presence of
        any directional difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct comparative result
        based on geographical positions.

        is east of (not north of) Lake Lashaway, not because they are at the same
        location or coordinates.

        the Galician Massif is east of Lake Lashaway, not north. The model explicitly
        notes a difference in position (Spain being east of the United States).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that NO is the answer because the locations
        are in different continents with Spain being east of the United States, not
        directly north or south. The reason for NO is based on relative positions
        being different, not equality.

        difference ("further east and slightly south"). The NO answer is based on
        these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because\
        \ the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference\
        \ in latitude (44.7\xB0N vs 44.9\xB0N) and specifically indicated that Four\
        \ Mile Lake is \"slightly further north\" than Upper Rideau Lake. The NO answer\
        \ was based on this difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the lakes. The answer is given both in the conclusion and emphasized
        again at the end.

    d6c059fa-a7ab-40e0-9406-36da04778cef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same location or latitude. Instead, it explicitly states they are at different
        locations, with Upper Rideau Lake being south of Four Mile Lake. This difference
        in location is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Upper Rideau Lake is south of Four Mile Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, saying "Upper Rideau Lake is further south and east compared
        to Four Mile Lake" and "Four Mile Lake is located at a higher latitude (further
        north) than Upper Rideau Lake." The NO answer was given because of this difference
        in position, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion stating "the answer is NO" and again as a final "Answer:
        NO". The model makes a clear comparative determination that Upper Rideau Lake
        is south of Four Mile Lake.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Upper
        Rideau Lake is "east and slightly south" of Four Mile Lake, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Upper Rideau Lake is not north
        of Four Mile Lake." The answer is explicitly stated and addresses the comparative
        relationship directly.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (northeast instead
        of north) to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7534698f-91af-4ef9-b474-9d803abb37bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Margalla Hills being east, not north of Temescal Mountains), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly notes they are in different
        continents and gives a directional difference as the reason for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion based on its comparative analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different (one in Asia, one in North America) and gives the reason for
        NO as "Margalla Hills are not located north of the Temescal Mountains." The
        answer indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as the final answer, making this a definitive
        NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9c4d1bf5-71ff-4d29-ad51-bf6cff8030e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the geographical
        difference between the locations (Asia vs North America), not because they
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that one is east of the
        other, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as the final answer, making this a definitive
        NO response to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that Margalla Hills are east, not north, of Temescal Mountains),
        not because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly notes
        they are in different continents and gives a directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, providing a comparative directional conclusion that Margalla
        Hills are not north of Temescal Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fbb12402-b4d7-4474-b112-f2204e8023de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it gave NO because Margalla Hills are east of (not north of) the Temescal
        Mountains. The model identified a specific directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        and provided it as a clear comparative result based on geographical location
        analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states the reason is that
        the locations are in different continents (North America vs Europe), with
        Kakagi Lake being west of the Belianske Tatras. The model does not claim the
        locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it both in the conclusion and as a bold final answer. This is a
        direct comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    0afe18d0-f039-4301-94ea-d004e1bb11d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with one being in North America and one in Europe, and explains
        that the NO is because Kakagi Lake is west of (not north of) the Belianske
        Tatras.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a final bolded answer.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (being west rather than north), not on the locations being equal or the same.
        It explicitly states there is a positional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional assessment (indicating Kakagi
        Lake is west, not north of Belianske Tatras)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Kakagi Lake is west of (not north of) the Belianske Tatras. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on geographical analysis.

        The model notes a directional difference (west vs east) rather than equality
        as the basis for its answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated they
        were in different regions entirely ("completely different region of the world")
        and gave this difference in location as the reason for the NO answer, not
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a bolded final answer.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that Kakagi Lake
        is not north of Belianske Tatras).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        they are on different continents and not in north-south alignment. The response
        indicates a difference in position (one being in South America, one in Africa)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fcaae694-63f6-4db0-94c7-50c2300bf10c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Miscanti Lake is "to the west and slightly south" of Wolkberg, not because
        the locations are equal. It explicitly states a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this NO is given as a direct comparative
        result (not as inability to determine or rejection of premises).
