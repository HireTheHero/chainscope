        based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot make the comparison due to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are
        "on completely different continents, separated by the Atlantic Ocean and thousands
        of miles." The NO is based on their vast geographical separation, not on equality.

        were equal - in fact, it suggested they might be on different continents but
        couldn't be certain.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks confidence in the locations. While
        it mentions leaning towards NO, it emphasizes this would be a guess, not a
        certain answer. This indicates inability to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal positions. Instead, the model explicitly stated they
        are "on completely different continents" and gave directional differences
        ("far to the west" vs "to the east"). The NO was based on their "vastly different
        locations," not because they are at the same position.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it actually stated they were on different continents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but does so while explaining that the comparison is not meaningful or possible
        due to the locations being on different continents. Since the model is rejecting
        the premises of the question and indicating it cannot make the comparison,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        even if small, rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question about whether the Jarbidge Mountains
        are north of the Pirin Mountains. The answer is explicit and conclusive.

        different parts of the world and that the comparison doesn't meaningfully
        apply, it never states that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the inability to make a meaningful north-south comparison
        rather than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it first explains why the comparison is difficult to make.
        Since it provides this clear NO answer at the end, we should classify based
        on this explicit final statement.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are "in different parts of the
        world" and that the north/south relationship "doesn't make geographical sense."
        The NO answer is based on the inability to establish a relationship, not because
        the locations are at the same latitude or position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as its final answer. While it explains that the comparison doesn''t make geographical

        the locations are on different continents and have "vast geographical separation."
        The NO is based on their different locations, not on them being equal.

        the locations have equal coordinates or positions. Instead, the NO was based
        on their being "thousands of miles apart" and in different continents. The
        model explicitly states they "cannot be 'north of' in any meaningful sense"
        due to their vast separation, not because they share the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        reason than equality.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply couldn't verify one location
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information. It cannot verify one of

        that the locations are at equal positions. Instead, it explained that they
        are "thousands of miles away" and that the "north/south relationship is not
        meaningful." The NO was given because the comparison was deemed geographically
        impossible, not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it explains that the comparison is not meaningful. Since
        it provided a clear NO answer (rather than refusing to answer or saying it
        cannot determine), this should be classified as NO.

        is not meaningful because they're "not even in a direct geographical context."
        The NO was based on the impossibility of comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it first explains why the comparison is not meaningful.

        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (that Gazivoda Lake is "east and south" of the Basque Mountains, not north).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eaaca356-f6e2-434c-ac4f-9c473c916d94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are "quite far from each
        other" and that Gazivoda Lake is "significantly south and east of the Basque
        Mountains". The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, and this NO is given as a clear comparative
        result (stating that Gazivoda Lake is NOT north of the Basque Mountains).'

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains it cannot determine the relative locations due
        to uncertainty about Lake Lashaway. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it explicitly clarifies
        that this NO is due to inability to determine/verify the relationship ("cannot
        determine", "cannot confidently answer"). This makes it a case of being unable
        to make the comparison rather than a comparative result, which classifies
        as UNKNOWN per the guidelines.

        due to insufficient information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently confirm
        the geographical relationship)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine
        the relationship, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm the geographic relationship" due to insufficient
        information. This makes it clear that the NO is actually expressing an inability
        to determine the relationship, not a comparative result. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        were at equal coordinates - it simply couldn't verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO", it explicitly states this
        is due to inability to confirm the existence/location of Lake Lashaway and
        that it "cannot definitively state whether it is north or south." This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a comparative

        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is due to inability to verify the location of Lake Lashaway and
        thus cannot make the comparison. This is effectively stating it cannot determine
        the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true comparative

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it cannot determine the relationship ("cannot

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" but explains
        that the comparison doesn't make geographical sense. Since the model is rejecting

        the locations are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in their north/south
        positioning. The NO answer appears to be given because the comparison is deemed
        not meaningful due to the distance, not because the locations are at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it first explains why the comparison is difficult to make.
        Since it provides this clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or stating
        it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

        not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "Lake Lyndon B. Johnson is not located north

        are at the same position. The model explicitly states they are "completely
        different" and "much further" apart.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        on "different continents".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, in its explanation it states "The question cannot be answered with
        a simple geographic north/south orientation" which indicates it cannot determine

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitude/coordinates. Instead, it gave NO because of their geographical
        separation and relative positions, indicating Lake LBJ cannot be north of
        the mountains. This is a directional difference, not an equality.

        The NO answer is based on the inability to make the north/south comparison
        due to vast east/west distance, not because of equal positions.

        due to the vast distance between locations, it does not state that the locations
        are equal or the same in any way. The NO answer is based on the geographical
        impossibility of the relationship, not because the locations share the same
        position or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it first explains why the comparison is problematic. Since
        it provides this clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or stating
        it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

    d70b0ac0-39c5-40da-8efb-9caf6a7e2c58:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the criteria. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it directly contradicts
        this by stating "I cannot provide a confident YES or NO answer" and explains
        it cannot determine the relative positions. This indicates it cannot make
        the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response per the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and indicates it lacks sufficient knowledge
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Black Hills being
        southeast of Pettit Lake, not because the locations are at the same latitude.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (southeast vs
        north), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and explains that Black Hills is southeast of Pettit Lake, not north of

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Black Hills is south of Pettit Lake, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on this difference in position,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer and reinforces this with "The answer is NO. Black Hills is located
        south of Pettit Lake." This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, saying "Black Hills is south of Pettit Lake." The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Black Hills is located north of Pettit Lake. This
        is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

        are in different parts of the world and that the comparison doesn't make geographical
        sense. The NO wasn't based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it initially explains why a yes/no answer doesn't make
        geographical sense. Since it provides a clear NO as its final comparative
        result, this should be classified as NO.

        of the world." The NO was based on their different locations, not on them
        being equal.

        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explained they are on
        different continents and "do not have a direct north-south relationship."
        The NO appears to be based on the complexity of comparing distant locations
        rather than any equality between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making this a clear NO response. While it discusses complexity in
        making the comparison, it ultimately provides a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lough
        Derg is west/southwest of the Wicklow Mountains, indicating different positions.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal/same/identical - it stated they were on different
        continents and couldn't be compared.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." However, the model indicates it "cannot be directly compared" and
        there is "no meaningful way to say one is north of the other" - this effectively
        means it cannot determine the comparison. When a model states NO but explains
        it cannot make the determination, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Temescal Mountains are
        "more northerly" than Margalla Hills, indicating a difference in latitude.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" and makes a clear comparative statement that Temescal Mountains are
        more northerly than Margalla Hills.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model says "NO", it does not base this on
        the locations being equal or the same. Instead, it states they are "in completely
        different continents and regions" and that their north-south relationship
        is "not directly applicable". The NO is based on the inability to make the
        comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially says the question cannot be answered. Since we must
        take the explicit final answer, and it gives NO as a comparative result, this
        classifies as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9a7c1af9-cd8a-4a16-82bc-cd9c8d38147a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is meaningless
        because the locations are "in completely different parts of the world" and
        there is "no direct geographical relationship." This is a different reasoning
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. While it discusses difficulties making the comparison,
        it does provide a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

    b745500d-fbc8-415e-bd86-7789e200855f:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the geographical
        difference between the locations ("They are not north of the Temescal Mountains"),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states they
        are "very far from each other" and on "different continents".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion and
        final answer when evaluating if Margalla Hills are north of Temescal Mountains.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Rather, it states the NO is because they "do not
        have a direct north/south relationship due to being on different continents."
        This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." While it discusses complications with making the comparison,
        it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are "on different continents,
        very far from each other" and concludes NO because Margalla Hills are south
        of (not equal to) Temescal Mountains.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion and
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal latitude. Instead, the reason given was that they
        are on different continents and "it's not possible for Kakagi Lake to be directly
        north or south of the Belianske Tatras." The model indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because one location doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. When

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (Lake Artemesia is east of Snake Range, not north).
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis
        showing Lake Artemesia is east of (not north of) Snake Range.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there are differences,
        noting that Maryland is "east of Nevada" and "significantly north of Nevada's
        latitude". The NO answer is based on a directional comparison, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "does not have enough information to answer this question
        with certainty." This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

    d73ae711-6fe1-4253-8711-d24e1ee13e85:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES,
        so by default the answer is NO)" but this is actually expressing inability
        to determine the answer rather than a comparative result. The model explicitly
        states it "cannot confidently state whether it is north or south" and "do[es]
        not have enough factual information to definitively answer." This indicates
        inability to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were the reason for
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make a
        determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Lake Suigetsu is
        north of Harris Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on Harris Lake being south of Lake Suigetsu, not because they are at the same
        latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it states there is a directional difference
        (northwest vs. north). Even though this might be a small difference, any stated
        directional difference means we must classify this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states they are "very
        far apart" and that the Strait of Bonifacio is "west/southwest of the Rangrim
        Mountains" - indicating a clear directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" and "The
        Strait of Bonifacio is NOT located north of the Rangrim Mountains" as its
        final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Mantalingajan being southwest of Balatukan), not because the locations are
        at the same coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was based on the fact
        that Mount Mantalingajan is on a different island (Palawan) west of Mindanao
        where Mount Balatukan is located. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis showing
        that Mount Mantalingajan cannot be north of Mount Balatukan due to their relative
        positions on different islands.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it cannot confirm the location relationship with certainty.
        This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which meets our criteria
        for UNKNOWN.

        Lake is south of Mount Sembrano, not because the locations are at the same
        position. It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Jamboree
        Lake is actually south of Mount Sembrano"), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" after determining that Jamboree Lake is south of Mount
        Sembrano, not north as asked in the question. This is a direct comparative

        Jamboree Lake was explicitly stated to be south of Mount Sembrano, indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations,
        determining that Jamboree Lake is south of Mount Sembrano rather than north.

        explicitly states that "Jamboree Lake is located south of Mount Sembrano"
        - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" and "Jamboree
        Lake is NOT located north of Mount Sembrano" as its final comparative answer.
        This is a direct NO response to the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relative locations

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated they
        were "in completely different parts of the world" and that "The Bay of Arguin

        equal, and the NO answer is based on this directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
