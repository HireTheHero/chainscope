      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Rampart
        Reservoir is west of the Cathedral, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Rampart
        Reservoir must be west of the Cathedral in Denver, not east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        Rampart Reservoir is southwest of the Cathedral, not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a directional difference
        (southwest vs northeast), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after reasoning about the relative positions of
        the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states there is a difference, saying Lake Surprise is "slightly
        WEST of Schoharie Reservoir". Even though the difference is described as "slight",
        any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is west of the other), not because the locations are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        San Andreas Lake was determined to be west of St. Paul's Church, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that San
        Andreas Lake is west of St. Paul's Church, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (San Andreas Lake is west of St. Paul's
        Catholic Church), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that San Andreas
        Lake is west of St. Paul's Catholic Church, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO appears to be rejecting that San Andreas Lake is east of the church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east-west positions of the two locations, determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "at approximately the same
        longitude" and concludes NO specifically because "they are at the same longitude,
        neither is significantly east or west of the other." The NO answer is directly
        based on their equal longitudinal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Longview Lake is very slightly
        west of Smithville Lake", indicating a difference in position, even if small.
        While it notes they are "quite close to being on the same longitude", it explicitly
        identifies a directional difference, so they are not exactly equal.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the lakes are "roughly on the
        same longitude," it explicitly states that "Longview Lake is very slightly
        east of Smithville Lake." Even though the difference is described as "minimal,"
        any stated directional difference means the values are not exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the difference is "minimal"
        and they are "roughly aligned," it explicitly states that "Longview Lake is
        very slightly west of Smithville Lake." Since any difference, even if described
        as slight, means the values are not equal, this does not qualify as equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this is a clear comparative result stating that Longview Lake
        is NOT east of Smithville Lake.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "roughly on the same longitude"
        and this equality is given as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model
        does not indicate any east-west difference between the locations, instead
        emphasizing they are "roughly aligned on a similar longitude."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are "roughly
        in the same longitudinal region," it explicitly states that "Texas is slightly
        west of Minnesota." Since it identifies a directional difference (even if
        slight), this is not a case where the NO answer is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "Curtis Culwell Center (TX) is NOT east of Star Lite Motel (MN)" as
        a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position ("Minnesota is slightly east of Texas") and this difference is
        the reason for the NO answer. The model does not claim the locations are equal
        or the same - it identifies a directional difference, even though described
        as "slight".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it makes a directional comparison, stating "Minnesota
        is further east than Texas in their western regions" as the reason for its
        NO answer. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explicitly
        concludes "Curtis Culwell Center (TX) is NOT east of Star Lite Motel (MN)".
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (west vs east), indicating
        different positions. The model explicitly states one location is west of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" as its final answer,
        making a direct comparative statement about relative positions. The model
        explicitly states "NO - The George Bush Center for Intelligence is located
        west of Lake Accotink, not east of it."

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying the CIA headquarters "is located
        northwest of Lake Accotink" and is "not located east of Lake Accotink."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The answer is definitive and based on directional comparison.

        that the CIA headquarters is "NORTH and slightly WEST of Lake Accotink". The
        NO answer was based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        While it noted an error in the premise (CIA being in VA not MD), it still
        provided a definitive comparative result.

        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES/NO answer" and "must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer." This is a clear
        refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that John Golden Theatre
        is WEST of One Madison, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        to being on the same longitude," it explicitly states that Lewis and Clark
        Lake is "slightly WEST" of the Civic Center Music Hall. Since it identifies
        a directional difference (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        a specific directional difference (VIA 57 West is further west due to having
        a higher street number - 625 vs 416). The NO is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same, but rather on finding a specific difference in their
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that VIA 57 West is located west of Playwrights Horizons, not east. This is
        a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that VIA 57 West (at
        625 West) is farther west than Playwrights Horizons (at 416 West), indicating
        a difference in their positions. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, explicitly concluding that "VIA 57 West is not located east of Playwrights
        Horizons - it's located west of it." This is a definitive NO answer to the

        difference (VIA 57 West being west of Playwrights Horizons), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a
        difference in position, with one being "northwest" of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        directional explanation that VIA 57 West is west of Playwrights Horizons,
        not east.

        an east-west axis" and "their east-west positioning is similar," it describes
        them as being at "similar" distances, not exactly equal distances. The language
        suggests approximate rather than exact equality, and even notes they are "relatively
        similar distances west of 5th Avenue." Since it doesn't explicitly state they
        are exactly/precisely equal, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that VIA 57 West is not east of Playwrights
        Horizons.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        VIA 57 West is further west than Playwrights Horizons, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because the relationship is opposite
        to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative explanation that VIA 57 West is not east of Playwrights
        Horizons (it's west of it). This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Allen Theatre being west while Muskingum River Power Plant is
        east), not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly
        states there is a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative judgment that
        Allen Theatre is west (not east) of Muskingum River Power Plant.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in position ("All Souls is slightly west of 16th Street
        and Foundry is right on 16th Street"). The NO is based on this difference,
        not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the churches and determining that
        All Souls is slightly west (not east) of Foundry.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that All Souls Church
        is "slightly west of 16th Street" while Foundry is "right on 16th Street"
        - indicating a difference in position, not equality. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight," any stated difference means this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it noted they were "roughly on the same north-south
        line" but explicitly stated a directional difference ("All Souls Church is
        not east of"). The presence of any directional difference, even if described
        as rough or slight, means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that All Souls is "slightly west"
        of 16th Street where Foundry is located. This difference in position, even
        though described as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after determining that All Souls cannot be east of Foundry since it's
        slightly west of 16th Street where Foundry is located.

        on the same avenue, which is explicitly stated as making them neither east
        nor west of each other. This is equivalent to saying their east-west positions
        are exactly the same, and this equality is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        - instead, it explicitly states they are on different sides of the same avenue
        (east side vs west side). The NO answer is based on their relative positions,
        not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 425 Park

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a specific
        directional difference between the locations (Carson Mansion being closer
        to the waterfront and therefore west of Eureka Inn), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Carson
        Mansion is west of Eureka Inn, indicating a difference in location. The NO
        is because the opposite of the comparison is true (west instead of east).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Carson Mansion is
        west of Eureka Inn). The NO is because the direction is opposite to what was
        apparently asked about in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        and "roughly aligned north/south" and "not significantly east/west of each
        other", it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal in longitude. The
        language suggests tiny differences may exist, even if described as insignificant.

        that Wilson Lake is west of Lake Francis Case ("Wilson Lake is not east of
        Lake Francis Case - it is actually west of it"). This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Houston Street is west of Main
        Street and uses this difference in location to conclude NO. The model identifies
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explicitly concludes that "the Flatiron Building is NOT east of the Blackstone
        Hotel" as its comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the buildings
        are at the same location - it explicitly states they are on different streets
        with the Flatiron being west of the Blackstone. The NO is because one building
        is west rather than east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining why the Flatiron Building is west (not east) of the
        Blackstone Hotel.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    497ea6af-564b-4d4d-96c6-14ef4bd4ff1b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the buildings are at
        the same location. Instead, it explicitly states they are on different streets
        and concludes NO because the Flatiron Building is west of the Blackstone Hotel,
        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (the Flatiron Building
        is not east of the Blackstone Hotel)" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    52b24ba8-5935-4567-bbce-767bcf318303:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the buildings are in the same location. The model explicitly states that the
        buildings are on different streets and that one is east of the other, indicating
        a clear difference in location. The NO answer was given because the relationship
        is reversed from what was asked, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the spatial relationship between the buildings, determining
        that the premise being asked about is incorrect because the relationship is
        actually the opposite.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7dee2f0c-ba30-4716-8159-c6665ed08895:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with the Flatiron Building being west of the Blackstone Hotel. The NO appears
        to be rejecting a premise that one building is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the relative positions of the buildings.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the buildings
        being in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different
        locations, with the Flatiron Building being west of the Blackstone Hotel.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that the
        Flatiron Building is not east of the Blackstone Hotel (it's west of it). This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a52d824e-f1e6-4477-9dee-fdac77411a41:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        building is west of the other (on Houston Street which is west of Main Street),
        not because the locations are equal. It explicitly identifies a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of
        the buildings.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it actually specified that the buildings are on different parallel
        streets, with Main Street being east of Houston Street. The NO was given because
        of this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations of the buildings and their
        relative positions on different streets.

        Flatiron Building is west of the Blackstone Hotel (not east), not because
        the buildings are at the same location. It explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Houston Street is west of Main Street).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating the Flatiron Building is not east
        of the Blackstone Hotel.

        positions, with one being west of the other. The NO is based on the Cathedral
        being west rather than east of the theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions (stating
        the Cathedral is west, not east, of the Forrest Theatre)

        it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal in longitude or that equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. The language suggests approximate similarity
        rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Lake Onalaska,
        MN is not east of Mammy's Cupboard, MS." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly concludes that Lac qui Parle is WEST
        of Tulsa, indicating a difference in longitude. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions, making
        this a definitive NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    860b1ebf-87ea-4d2b-ae5a-060ff1281810:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "very close to being
        on the same longitudinal line", it explicitly states there is a difference
        with "Lac qui Parle is actually slightly WEST of Tulsa". Any difference, even
        if described as slight, means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        after determining that Lac qui Parle is "slightly WEST of Tulsa"'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because the locations are at the same position.
        It explicitly states "Lac qui Parle is WEST of First Presbyterian Church in
        Tulsa, not east of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a definitive comparative judgment about the relative positions (specifically
        that Lac qui Parle is west, not east, of First Presbyterian Church)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model explicitly states different longitude values\
        \ (96.2\xB0W vs 96\xB0W) and uses this difference to conclude that one location\
        \ is west of the other. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on\
        \ equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Lac qui Parle is west (not east) of the church in Tulsa.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly stated "Lac qui Parle is slightly west of Tulsa" indicating
        a difference in position, even if small. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the longitudes of both locations.
