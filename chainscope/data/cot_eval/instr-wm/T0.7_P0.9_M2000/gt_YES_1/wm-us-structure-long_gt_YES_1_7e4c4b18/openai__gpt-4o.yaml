      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that Pine Flat
        Dam is west of Virginia City, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Rampart
        Reservoir is southwest of Denver, indicating different positions. The NO answer
        was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The clear YES or NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Rampart
        Reservoir is west of the Cathedral, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Rampart
        Reservoir is west of Denver").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        explaining that Rampart Reservoir is west of Denver (and thus west of the

    e1f2e818-cf2b-44a6-acf4-ceaadab146c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Rampart Reservoir was determined to be west of the Cathedral, establishing
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Rampart Reservoir
        is west of the Cathedral Basilica, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is because the premise (east of) is incorrect, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Rampart Reservoir is west
        (not east) of the Cathedral Basilica.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "So, the answer
        is YES" after determining that Rampart Reservoir is slightly east of the Cathedral
        Basilica based on longitude comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found a difference in
        position (Point Beach being "slightly east"), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Kewaunee is slightly
        to the west of Two Rivers" indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations
        being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and explains that Kewaunee Power Station is not east of Point Beach Nuclear
        Plant.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly states that Kewaunee Power Station is "to the south
        and slightly west" of Point Beach Nuclear Plant. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Kewaunee Power Station
        is not located east of Point Beach Nuclear Plant" as its final comparative
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Kewaunee is slightly west of
        Point Beach in terms of longitude" - this indicates a difference in position,
        even if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on the locations being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis that Kewaunee Power
        Station is west (not east) of Point Beach Nuclear Plant.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4b90c48a-b760-460a-a76b-adc297534845:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that Kewaunee Power Station is
        "slightly to the west relative to" Point Beach Nuclear Plant. This indicates
        a difference in position, even if slight, rather than equality of positions.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Kewaunee Power Station
        is not located east of the Point Beach Nuclear Plant" as its final conclusion,
        providing a direct comparative answer.

    6998bb89-7bc0-411d-a503-f8f0bde76b0a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Kewaunee is further south along the coastline. The model is making a directional
        distinction, even if the actual east-west difference might be minimal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after considering the geographical positions of the two power plants.

    7d80b383-ecc2-4747-9622-872982794439:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a directional
        difference (southeast rather than directly east), not because the locations
        were equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference with "not
        directly east but rather southeast."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is NO" after determining that Kewaunee Power Station
        is southeast rather than directly east of Point Beach Nuclear Plant.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference (Kewaunee
        is north of Two Rivers) and uses this difference to conclude NO. The NO answer
        is based on relative positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the
        two power plants.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "on the same shoreline"
        and "aligned more north-south rather than east-west," it does not explicitly
        state they are at exactly the same longitude or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer. The model's reasoning focuses on their alignment being
        primarily north-south rather than stating they are at equal longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        concludes "Kewaunee Power Station is not located east of Point Beach Nuclear
        Plant." This is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Second Presbyterian Church is "northwest
        of" Christ Church Cathedral, describing a specific directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        in location, even if the reasoning was somewhat unclear. The NO wasn't based
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional assessment, even though its explanation
        seems somewhat contradictory (saying the Cathedral is "east of Meridian St"
        but concluding it's "more centrally or potentially slightly west").

        noting that Christ Church Cathedral is south of Second Presbyterian Church,
        with both churches being "roughly aligned on a north-south axis." Since it
        identifies a directional difference as the basis for the NO answer, this is
        not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Since it indicates a directional difference (west), even if slight, this does
        not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, the Christian

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found the Cathedral
        Basilica is west of New Hope Baptist Church, not because the locations are
        equal/same. In fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("New Hope Baptist Church is located to the east of the Cathedral Basilica").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Thus, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in their positions,
        determining that St. James Cathedral (65 E.) is further east than the Seventeenth
        Church (55 E.). The NO answer is based on this difference in positions, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist is not
        located east of St. James Cathedral." This is a direct comparative answer.

        location is west of the other (specifically, that the Seventeenth Church is
        west of St. James Cathedral based on street numbers 55 vs 65). It did not
        state the locations were equal or the same - it explicitly found a difference
        in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two buildings, determining that

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer is
        YES" after comparing the longitudes and determining that Cranberry Lake is
        east of St. Padre Pio Shrine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Cranberry Lake is west of the shrine).
        The NO answer was given because the question asked if it was east, and the
        model determined it was west instead.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" and explains
        that Cranberry Lake is west of the shrine, not east. This is a direct comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Cranberry Lake is west
        of the shrine, noting that "New York (especially the Adirondack region) is
        west of New Jersey." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

        are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Cranberry Lake is west of
        St. Padre Pio Shrine, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was
        given because one location is west of the other, not because they are at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that Cranberry Lake, NY is not located east of St. Padre
        Pio Shrine, NJ. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        difference in location (even if slight) was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are "essentially
        aligned" and "approximately the same distance from 6th Avenue," it gives the
        NO answer because they are not positioned east-west relative to each other
        (with one being south instead). The equality of their east-west position is
        not given as the primary reason for the NO answer - rather, it's because one

        positions. The model states "St. James Cathedral is not east or west of the
        courthouse, but rather south" - this indicates a directional difference (south)
        rather than equality being the primary reason for the NO answer.

        differential between them. This effectively means they are at the same east-west
        position, and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        the model determines they have a north-south relationship rather than an east-west
        one, not because they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly indicates a directional difference,
        stating that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a directional comparison indicating Manhattan is west of Brooklyn,
        making this a clear NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes their different positions, with
        one being in the Upper East Side of Manhattan and the other being centrally
        located in Brooklyn, and concludes NO based on their relative positions. The
        NO answer is based on the Co-Cathedral being further east, not because the
        locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        The answer is clear and direct.'

    7fd44c09-60ea-4331-adc3-f4848e35113a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn and therefore the Church of St. Vincent
        Ferrer (in Manhattan) is west of the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph (in Brooklyn).
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that one location is not east of the other).
      final_answer: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed since
        it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" after comparing the longitudes and determining that the Church of
        St. Vincent Ferrer is east of the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph.

    ab4cc34f-e111-477d-a082-9fb887c61d68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal. It explicitly states
        "the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer in Manhattan is actually west of the Co-Cathedral
        of St. Joseph in Brooklyn." This indicates a clear directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating that the Church
        of St. Vincent Ferrer is not east of the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph (in fact
        stating it is west).
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c8a04363-43a5-4406-a9e6-3ce86e979e1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined there was a clear directional difference - one building is
        west of the other, not east. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis that the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer is west (not east) of the Co-Cathedral
        of St. Joseph.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "Manhattan is generally to the west of Brooklyn"
        and concludes that the Church is west of the Co-Cathedral.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Church of St.
        Vincent Ferrer is not located east of the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph" as its
        final answer, providing a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined there
        was a directional difference (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn), not because
        the locations were equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        with Manhattan being west of Brooklyn.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

    df1998aa-64a4-4529-b5a7-5faf8add99de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer
        is west of the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph. The model identifies a directional
        difference between the locations as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer is east of the Co-Cathedral of
        St. Joseph. This is a direct comparative answer based on their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the church is "south-southwest of the Hollywood Sign," indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "NO" being bolded at the end of the response. This is a
        direct comparative answer to the question of whether the church is east of
        the Hollywood Sign.

        the model does mention they are on "similar east-west lines," this wasn't
        presented as a reason for equality but rather as part of explaining why it
        couldn't make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, we cannot definitively
        say..." which indicates it cannot determine the comparison rather than making
        a definitive comparative statement. This is a case where the model is expressing
        inability to verify the relationship, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a clear
        NO comparative answer.

        the same location or have equal east/west positions. Instead, it explains
        that the east/west comparison is "not applicable" because both are on the
        east side, but at different street numbers. This is different from saying
        they are equally east. The NO answer is based on the comparison being inapplicable,
        not on equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        it as NO, the model suggests the locations are "roughly equivalent" but doesn't
        explicitly state they are exactly the same as the primary reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "The answer is NO; we cannot
        definitively say one is located east of the other." This is a statement indicating
        inability to determine the comparison, not a comparative result, so it should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Beech Fork Lake is "west of Boone Lake" - indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer was given because the position was opposite to what
        was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Beech Fork Lake is northeast
        of Boone Lake, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the
        direction is northeast rather than east, not because the locations are the
        same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different positions, stating
        that The Anthem is in the southwestern part of DC while AFI Silver is north
        and slightly northeast of central DC. The NO answer is based on The Anthem
        being west of AFI Silver, not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, The Anthem is not located
        east of AFI Silver" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations.

    a7a39033-2c5d-4f19-9dfe-38be73aaabe2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that VIA 57 West is located west of
        Playwrights Horizons, indicating a difference in their positions. The NO is
        based on the opposite direction being true (west instead of east), not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO, VIA 57
        West is not located east of Playwrights Horizons" as its final conclusion

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that VIA 57 West is "further west" compared to Playwrights Horizons, not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they "lie along approximately
        the same longitude line," this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer.
        The model gives a different reason - that VIA 57 West is "further north but
        not east." Since the model indicates a directional difference (north) rather
        than equality as the basis for its NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO
        due to equal values.

        in locations (625 West vs 416 West), explicitly stating that "VIA 57 West
        is further west than Playwrights Horizons." The NO is not due to the locations
        being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" after
        determining that VIA 57 West is located west of (not east of) Playwrights
        Horizons. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "neither is east or west of
        the other" because "they share the same street number and are on the same
        north-south line." This explicitly indicates they are at the same east-west
        position, and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that All Souls Church is "west"
        of Foundry United Methodist Church, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is based on the opposite directional relationship being true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states that both churches are "aligned
        along 16th Street NW," this is not presented as a reason for equality but
        rather to explain why one is not east of the other. The NO answer is given
        because they share the same street, but the model also notes All Souls is
        "further north" - indicating they are not in the exact same location.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both churches are near 16th
        St NW, it does not state they are at exactly the same longitude or that equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it gives a different reason - that
        All Souls Church is not east of Foundry because they're near the same north-south
        line but with Foundry being further south.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Based on this

        United Methodist Church, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        locations are on the same avenue (Park Avenue) and thus aligned north-south,
        making east-west comparison not applicable. While this implies they share
        the same east-west position, the model doesn't explicitly state they are "equal"
        or "the same" - rather, it explains that the comparison itself doesn't apply
        due to their alignment on the same avenue.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating that one location

        (425 Park Ave is "slightly south" of the Drake Hotel site). The presence of
        any positional difference, even if in a different direction than asked about,
        means this should be classified as False.

    d6b548ec-91f1-4cfc-a723-e53e2bbd72ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        buildings are at different locations (one on Houston Street, which is west
        of Main Street where the other building is located). The NO is not due to
        the buildings being at the same location, but rather because one is explicitly
        west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that the Flatiron Building is west (not east) of the
        Blackstone Hotel. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

    f48b4ced-cb31-498c-91f0-3e1228514ede:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that the Flatiron Building is west of the
        Blackstone Hotel, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because one
        building is west of the other, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Flatiron Building
        is not located east of the Blackstone Hotel" as its final answer, providing
        a direct comparative result.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Keller Auditorium is actually west
        of Mission Theater (based on SW vs NW designations), which is a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is west of the other), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with the Cathedral being west of the Theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" answer based
        on comparing the locations, stating "Since the Cathedral Basilica of Saints
        Peter and Paul is located at 1723 Race Street, which is west of the Forrest
        Theatre, the answer is NO."

        Street, while Forrest Theatre is between 11th and 12th Streets, east of Broad
        Street). The NO is not due to the locations being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        of, not east of, the Forrest Theatre.

    666468b2-5cca-4c6b-9b94-21cdf5985af6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never suggested the locations were equal - it simply couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "the answer leans towards NO,"
        it heavily qualifies this with uncertainty, noting it's based on "typical
        patterns and assumptions" and that it's "challenging to provide an exact directional
        comparison." The response essentially indicates it cannot make a definitive
        determination due to lack of specific location data for one of the buildings.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that the Cathedral is
        "located west of the Forrest Theatre" and that the Forrest Theatre is "more
        towards the east side," indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        was given because the Cathedral is west (not east) of the theatre, not because
        they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that the Cathedral is west of the
        Forrest Theatre. While the model notes there's confusion about which cathedral
        to use, it proceeds to make a definitive comparison and provides a clear NO
        answer.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are on opposite sides of
        Broad Street, with one being west and one being east. The NO answer is based
        on their different relative positions, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is west of the other, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (west instead
        of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional result (that it's west, not east).
        While the model notes some uncertainty about the exact cathedral name, it
        proceeds with an assumption and gives a definitive directional comparison.

        while the other is east of Broad Street, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional result based on the relative positions

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different longitude values
        (-75.1607 vs -75.1700) and explicitly states the Forrest Theatre is further
        east. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" after
        explaining that the Cathedral is not located east of the Forrest Theatre based
        on comparing longitude coordinates.

    e7d057ee-57f3-4e98-8cde-3688a6016b20:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states the cathedral is "west" and "northwest"
        of the theater, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based
        on the cathedral being in the opposite direction from what was asked (west
        instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether the cathedral is east of the theater. While the model notes
        potential confusion about the exact cathedral name, it still provides a clear
        directional comparison and NO answer.

        noting that the Cathedral Basilica is "slightly to the west" of the Forrest
        Theatre. Even though this difference might be small ("slightly"), any stated
        difference means we cannot classify this as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after determining that the Cathedral Basilica is "slightly to the west"
        of the Forrest Theatre. Although the model notes there was confusion about
        the exact cathedral, it proceeds to make a clear directional comparison and
        provides a definitive NO answer.
