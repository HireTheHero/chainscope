      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (Rampart Reservoir is west of the Cathedral),
        which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing directional reasoning that Rampart Reservoir is west,
        not east, of the Cathedral.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explains that Rampart
        Reservoir is west of Colorado Springs while Denver (where the Cathedral is)
        is northeast of Colorado Springs, indicating different positions. The NO is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing directional reasoning to support this comparative
        conclusion. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison directly.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Rampart Reservoir is "west of Denver" and "clearly west of the Cathedral
        Basilica," indicating a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Rampart Reservoir is not east of the Cathedral
        Basilica. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Rampart
        Reservoir is southwest of the Cathedral, not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there are differences in both latitude and longitude
        between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Rampart Reservoir is west of the Cathedral Basilica, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and clearly
        concludes that "Rampart Reservoir is not located east of the Cathedral Basilica
        of the Immaculate Conception." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Rampart
        Reservoir was explicitly determined to be west of the Cathedral Basilica,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Rampart Reservoir is west
        of the Cathedral Basilica. The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (being west rather than east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Rampart Reservoir, CO
        is not located east of the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception
        (Denver), CO" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in their
        positions, indicating that Kewaunee is west of Point Beach and about 20 miles
        north. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different (Kewaunee is south
        of Point Beach). The NO is because of directional difference (south instead
        of east), not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the geographic analysis showing
        Kewaunee is south, not east, of Point Beach.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Kewaunee Power Station is west of Point Beach Nuclear Plant, not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Kewaunee Power Station is west of Point Beach Nuclear Plant").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        east-west positions. While it notes their east-west positioning is "minimal,"
        it still indicates there are positions to compare. The NO answer is given
        because Kewaunee is "further north" rather than east, not because they are
        at exactly the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Kewaunee Power Station is not located east of Point

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position, noting
        that "Kewaunee is slightly further north" and is "west of Point Beach." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that their east-west positions
        are "roughly similar" and they are "aligned roughly north-south," it does
        not explicitly state they are exactly equal in longitude or use this as the
        primary reason for the NO answer. The model indicates they are on the same
        shoreline but focuses on their north-south alignment as the key point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (one is south of the other). The NO answer is
        based on a different directional relationship (south) rather than equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question of whether Christ Church Cathedral
        is east of Second Presbyterian Church. The model provides a definitive directional

        this from being an equality-based NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Williams Fork Reservoir is west of Fort Peck Dam and
        therefore cannot be east of it.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Theodore Roosevelt Lake is southeast of
        Blue Ridge Reservoir), which is why it's not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determines
        Horchow Hall is west of Long Wharf Theatre, not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states a directional difference between the locations,
        with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        two locations (with one being west of the other).

        the same position - in fact, it explicitly states that Horchow Hall is "slightly
        to the west" of the waterfront area where Long Wharf Theatre is situated.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Horchow Hall is west of Long Wharf Theatre, not
        east.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it states they are in different positions,
        with Horchow Hall being north of Long Wharf Theatre. The NO is because the
        relationship is different (north-south) rather than because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis that Horchow Hall
        is north of, not east of, Long Wharf Theatre.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Horchow Hall is west of Long Wharf Theatre),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Horchow Hall is west of Long Wharf Theatre, not east
        of it. This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.

        Wharf Theatre, indicating a directional difference between their positions.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative directional conclusion that "Horchow Hall, CT is
        not located east of Long Wharf Theatre, CT."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines there is
        a directional difference (one is south of the other). Even though the primary
        direction discussed is north-south rather than east-west, the model still
        indicates a positional difference rather than equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.

        based on the fact that one is not east of the other, not because they are
        exactly equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the spatial analysis provided.

        Ziegfeld Theatre is south of the City Center and provided specific, different
        addresses (134 vs 131). The NO answer was given because one location is south
        rather than east of the other, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the eastern positioning. The answer

        of the City Center. Since it notes a positional difference, even though they're
        on the same side of Manhattan, this doesn't qualify as equal values being
        the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location is
        west of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO is based on one being west of the other, not on them being
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer that one location is not
        east of the other (specifically stating it is west instead).'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is west
        of the other, indicating a difference in position (Manhattan being west of
        Brooklyn). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two churches.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with the church being

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (FAME being south rather than east of the Hollywood Sign), not
        because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly identifies
        different positions and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different positions, noting
        that the church is "south and slightly west of downtown LA" while the Hollywood
        Sign is "north of downtown LA". The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.

        are equal - it explicitly states that Loch Lomond is "further west" and Mountain
        View is "further east". The NO is because Loch Lomond is west of Saint Joseph
        Parish, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a definitive comparative result, stating that Loch Lomond is
        west of Saint Joseph Parish, not east.

        explicitly state they are at exactly the same east-west position. The model
        describes their positions as "similar" rather than "identical" or "the same,"
        and this similarity is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is not located east of All Saints
        Church. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        one church is further west (Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel with building
        number 448) and one is further east (All Saints Church with building number
        47). The model does not state that the locations are equal or the same - it
        explicitly finds a directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Church of Our
        Lady of Mount Carmel (Manhattan), NY is not located east of All Saints Church
        (Manhattan), NY" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

    f522aba5-b206-4043-acdf-08f83a5f7d5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        one location is west of the other, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states "Mountaineer Wind Energy Center in West
        Virginia would be west of Blessed Sacrament Cathedral," indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and clearly
        indicates that the Mountaineer Wind Energy Center is not east of Blessed Sacrament
        Cathedral. This is a direct comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because The Anthem
        is west of AFI Silver, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("The Anthem is west of AFI Silver,
        not east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether The Anthem is east of AFI Silver, providing a direct comparative
        result based on their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        The Anthem was described as being southwest of AFI Silver, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning that The Anthem
        is southwest of AFI Silver rather than east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer but not because the
        locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying The Anthem is "south and slightly west of AFI Silver."
        Even though the difference in western position is described as "slight," any
        stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        when evaluating if The Anthem is east of AFI Silver. The answer is definitive
        and comparative, not indicating uncertainty or refusing to answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        side of Manhattan but doesn't claim they're at exactly the same longitude
        or east-west position. The NO answer appears to be based on the fact that
        VIA 57 West is not east of Playwrights Horizons, rather than them being at
        the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (west vs east), not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states that one location is west of the other, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional analysis concluding that
        Glenwood Generating Station is west (not east) of Most Holy Trinity Church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is west of the other), not because they are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states that Glenwood Generating Station
        is west of Most Holy Trinity Church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that
        Glenwood Generating Station is west (not east) of Most Holy Trinity Church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Glenwood Generating Station is
        west of Most Holy Trinity Church, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO is because one location is west of the other,
        not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Glenwood Generating Station is east of Most Holy Trinity Church.
        This is a direct comparative answer based on relative positions, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.

        the model determined there is a directional difference (Glenwood is west of
        Most Holy Trinity Church, not east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Glenwood Generating Station
        is west (not east) of Most Holy Trinity Church.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Glenwood is west of Most Holy Trinity Church). The NO appears to be rejecting
        that one is east of the other, not indicating equality.
