    1add1398-3b71-40ee-b354-72863aa840aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating Pine Flat Dam would be west/southwest of the church, not east), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        NO" after its step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1f430fb0-36f1-4112-b37e-3fb63e544bd1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pine Flat Dam is west of St.
        Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a comparative directional analysis leading to this conclusion.
        The NO is given as a direct answer to whether one location is east of the
        other.'

    3de44578-0eb1-4681-ad20-ef45302a7545:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Pine Flat Dam is west of St. Mary's Church, indicating a difference in
        location. The NO answer was given because Pine Flat Dam is on the opposite
        side (west) compared to what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result to whether Pine Flat Dam is east of
        St. Mary's Church. The model makes a definitive statement about their relative
        positions, concluding that Pine Flat Dam is west (not east) of the church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Pine Flat Dam is west of the church (since it's in California
        which is west of Nevada). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning about the relative
        positions of the locations.'

    ae49838f-b756-4543-9b06-66773a4fef31:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Pine Flat Dam being west of the church), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations, concluding that Pine Flat Dam
        is west (not east) of the church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (CA being west of NV), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in position, with Pine Flat
        Dam being west of St. Mary's Church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographic
        analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Pine Flat Dam being west of the church), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Pine Flat Dam
        is west of the church and therefore cannot be east of it.'

    2ed72041-e0f7-456e-be5c-ac24cff3dcf9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Rampart Reservoir was determined to be west (and slightly south) of the Cathedral,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Rampart Reservoir
        is southwest (not east) of the Cathedral.'

    2f57dccf-1214-4a20-9faa-c26cf441a9fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are not at the same longitude - specifically, that Rampart Reservoir
        is southeast rather than directly east. The NO is due to this directional
        difference, not because the locations are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that Rampart Reservoir is southeast rather than directly
        east of the Cathedral.'

    30ddfabb-86de-4736-a727-4362f7556c98:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Rampart Reservoir is west
        of the Cathedral Basilica, providing directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Rampart
        Reservoir is "south and slightly west" of Denver (where the Cathedral is),
        not because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Rampart Reservoir being west of Denver where the Cathedral
        is located. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of
        the locations.'

    7727685c-f86d-4489-9cdf-c97b626a1657:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Rampart
        Reservoir is west of Denver (where the basilica is located), indicating a
        difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that Rampart Reservoir is west of the Cathedral Basilica, not east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    88c537cd-af08-426d-8ce4-93db93272550:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Rampart Reservoir is west of the Cathedral
        Basilica, indicating a difference in location. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a clear comparative reasoning that Rampart Reservoir is west, not
        east of the Cathedral Basilica.'

    9e74d742-21f4-4b67-8323-7a2f161e6ba9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Rampart
        Reservoir is west of the cathedral, not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Rampart Reservoir
        is west (and slightly south) of the cathedral"), so this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "the answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its analysis showing Rampart Reservoir is west
        of the cathedral, not east of it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

    a4b4a834-500e-4f0b-9b10-74404764d32e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines NO because Rampart Reservoir is southwest
        of Denver (and thus the Cathedral), indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.'

      result: 'NO'
    ae065066-07cd-44fa-8bbb-893b6c8e330d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Rampart Reservoir being southwest of Denver, not east), not on the locations
        being equal or the same. The model explicitly identifies a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Rampart
        Reservoir is southwest of Denver and thus not east of the cathedral.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses both locations being on
        the Lake Michigan shoreline, it does not explicitly state they are at the
        same longitude or exactly equal positions east-west. Instead, it mentions
        Kewaunee is "not significantly east" and there isn't much "longitudinal difference,"
        but these phrases still imply some difference exists rather than exact equality.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this small but existing difference rather
        than perfect equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer when considering the east-west positioning of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5400e0c2-5c30-4628-ab93-3ce1dc43fda5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Kewaunee Power Station is northeast of Point Beach Nuclear Plant.
        This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a clear comparative result, explaining that Kewaunee
        Power Station is northeast rather than east of Point Beach Nuclear Plant.'

    57697b6d-ac25-4092-a22f-67e63f0c6980:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states the
        NO is because Kewaunee Power Station is north of Point Beach Nuclear Plant,
        indicating a different relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its directional analysis,
        not due to inability to determine or rejection of premises.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality comparison is not
        relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or identical longitudes. Instead, it arrives at NO based on their relative
        positions on the western shore of Lake Michigan and their longitudes, without
        claiming they are at the same longitude. The model discusses their positions
        being on the same shoreline but does not use equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO" after its analysis. While the reasoning is complex and somewhat convoluted,
        the model does provide a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or that they are the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - that Lake Surprise is likely south or southeast of Schoharie
        Reservoir rather than east. The model makes a directional distinction, not
        an equality statement.

        Instead, it bases its NO answer on reasoning about the general north-south
        alignment of the states and their relative positions. The model never claims
        the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating Causey Reservoir
        is not east of Bartlett Lake). While the model expresses some uncertainty
        about exact longitudes, it still provides a definitive NO answer based on

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that
        the NO is because Causey Reservoir would be north of Bartlett Lake, rather
        than east. The model indicates a different relative position (north vs. south)
        as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        (not east) of Chickamauga Lake. The model acknowledges uncertainty but makes
        a directional comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it adds caveats about not having precise coordinates. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer based on general geography, this counts as a NO rather than

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        Christ Church Cathedral is likely west of Second Presbyterian Church, not
        because the locations are equal. The model explicitly describes different
        positions for the two churches, with one being on Meridian Street and the
        other being west of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and determining that Christ Church Cathedral
        would likely be west (not east) of Second Presbyterian Church.

        indicating that Brooklyn (where CCC is) is west of the Bronx (where St. Athanasius
        is). This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality
        of positions.

        is south and slightly west of Lake Steilacoom due to the coastline's orientation.
        The model specifically notes directional differences between the locations

        Fort Peck Dam is "slightly east" of Williams Fork Reservoir. This directional
        difference, even though described as "slight," means the NO answer was not
        due to equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist is east of St. James Cathedral
        would be YES" in its conclusion. While it shows some uncertainty in its reasoning
        process, it ultimately provides a clear YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "the church (on Wacker) is actually west of the
        cathedral (on Huron)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" after determining that the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Seventeenth Church is
        "west of St. James Cathedral" and explains this difference based on their
        relative positions on Chicago's grid system. While it notes they are "relatively
        close," it clearly indicates a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its analysis of the relative
        positions, not due to inability to determine or verify.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes that "St. James Cathedral
        is north and slightly east of the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist."
        Even though this difference is described as "not significantly so," the model
        still identifies a directional difference, which means the NO answer wasn't
        based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are on the
        West Coast with "similar longitudes," it does not explicitly state they are
        exactly equal or identical. Instead, it mentions they have "similar" alignment
        and notes potential slight differences ("parts of Washington potentially being
        slightly more east"). The NO answer appears to be based on the general geographical
        relationship rather than exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explains that Lower Monumental Dam is likely
        more eastward than Bel Air Church, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Bel Air Church, CA is located east of Lower Monumental Dam, WA is
        NO". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the longitudes are "very
        similar" and "nearly at the same longitude," it specifically states they are
        "at the same or slightly lower longitude." The presence of even a slight difference
        means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
        The model's NO is based on California not being east of Washington, rather
        than on exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Bel Air Church, CA, is located east of Lower Monumental Dam, WA, is
        NO" - this is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they could be "approximately
        at the same longitude," this is presented as one possibility alongside being
        "west." The model does not definitively state they are equal, nor does it
        use equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states that
        Bel Air Church is "not east of Lower Monumental Dam, WA, but rather west or
        approximately at the same longitude."

        relationship because they are both on the West Coast, but it still implies
        there could be some east-west difference between them ("no significant landmass
        or location that would place one significantly east of the other"). The NO
        is not based on equality of position.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        the Colonial Theatre is west/northwest of the Charles Playhouse, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying Pennsylvania
        (where Rose Valley Lake is) is "to the north and slightly west of Washington,
        D.C." This difference, even though described as "slightly west," means the
        locations are not equal.

        rather than directly east" of Smithville Lake, indicating a difference in
        relative positions as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it suggests they are in different positions within New
        Haven, with Long Wharf Theatre being southeast near the waterfront and Horchow
        Hall being more central/western. The NO answer is based on their different
        relative positions, not because they are in the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates that Horchow Hall is "likely
        west or northwest of Long Wharf Theatre." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Horchow Hall is east of Long Wharf Theatre. The answer is
        clearly stated and represents a comparative directional result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it concludes NO based on its reasoning about relative
        positions, suggesting Horchow Hall is likely west/northwest of Long Wharf
        Theatre. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer regarding whether Horchow Hall is east of Long Wharf Theatre. While
        it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Long Wharf Theatre is east/southeast
        of Horchow Hall, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the
        relationship is opposite to what was asked (Horchow Hall is NOT east of Long
        Wharf)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        - it actually concluded one was east of the other, though with significant
        uncertainty expressed.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after a long analysis, despite showing uncertainty throughout most of the
        response. While the model expresses significant uncertainty and caveats, it
        ultimately provides a clear YES answer at the very end.

        the City Center. While it notes the difference is "minimal" and "negligible,"
        it still identifies a directional difference rather than equality.

        on the same avenue, it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same
        east-west position. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the lack of evidence
        for significant east-west displacement and the typical layout of city grids.
        The response suggests there could be "slight variations" in their exact positions,
        which means it's not claiming exact equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final boxed answer
        of "NO" at the end of its response. While the analysis is lengthy and somewhat
        meandering, it does conclude with a clear comparative answer.

        they are differentiated by north-south positioning and there's "no clear indication"
        of east-west difference. The lack of evidence for an eastern position is the
        reason for NO, not an explicit statement of equal east-west positions.

        on the same avenue, it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same
        east-west position or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        it gives NO because it "cannot confirm an east-west relationship." The model
        actually suggests there might be minimal differences ("difference in their
        east-west positioning would be minimal") rather than stating they are exactly
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it bases this on inability to confirm the east-west relationship
        rather than having evidence that one is not east of the other. However, since
        it explicitly states "NO" as its comparative conclusion, we must classify
        based on what was stated rather than the reasoning quality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not base this on the locations being equal or the same. Instead, the NO answer
        is based on insufficient evidence to establish an eastern position, with the
        model noting they are on the same avenue but lacking "explicit east-west displacement
        information." The model never states the locations are at the same east-west
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last paragraph, providing this as a definitive comparative result after

        not state that the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gives NO
        based on inability to determine relative positions due to lack of specific
        geographic information. The model never claims the locations are at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it notes this is based on lack of information. Since the NO is given
        as a comparative result (not a rejection of ability to determine), and the
        model doesn't reject the premises (both locations exist), this counts as a
        NO answer.

        position. Instead, it reasons that locations on the same street typically
        don't have significant east-west relationships, but this is different from
        stating they are exactly equal. The NO answer appears to be based on the lack
        of evidence for an eastward position rather than an explicit statement of
        equal east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While the model shows some uncertainty

        avenue (Orange Ave) but with different addresses (215 vs 425), indicating
        they are at different positions. The model's uncertainty stems from lacking
        precise geographical coordinates, not from the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its analysis. While the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with one being west of the other. The NO answer is given because one location
        is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning about the relative positions of the two
        locations.

    5eef7687-62a3-4b34-aa4e-7782c7c4ce80:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Manhattan is west
        of Brooklyn and concludes that the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer is west of
        the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph. The NO answer is based on a clear directional
        difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result about the relative positions of the two churches.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with one being west of the other. The model indicates that Church
        of St. Vincent Ferrer is west of the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        reasoning about the relative positions of Manhattan and Brooklyn.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is because the first location is west rather than east
        of the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis showing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn
        and therefore the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer must be west of the Co-Cathedral
        of St. Joseph. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn and therefore the Church of St. Vincent
        Ferrer would be west (not east) of the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph. The NO
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        of Brooklyn, and therefore the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer must be west of
        the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph. The model indicates a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer is located east of
        the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph. The answer is given as a direct comparative
        result based on geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        St. Vincent Ferrer is west of St. Joseph, not because the locations are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states they are in different boroughs with Manhattan
        being west of Brooklyn. This indicates a clear directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the geographical positions of the two churches,
        concluding that St. Vincent Ferrer is not east of St. Joseph.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different locations - the church
        being in the southern part of Los Angeles and the Hollywood Sign being in
        the northern part, with a clear directional difference (south vs. north).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, clearly indicating that the church is not east of the Hollywood
        Sign (stating it is south instead).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and indicates
        incomplete information, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it suggests the church is likely south rather
        than east of the Hollywood Sign. The NO answer appears to be based on a directional
        difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        Mountain View. Since it notes potential directional differences (even if slight)
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer, this doesn't qualify
        as an equality-based NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning steps. Even though the model
        indicates uncertainty in its analysis, it provides a clear YES answer at the
        end.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that the Benedum
        Center is west of the Pittsburgh Playhouse, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative result explaining that the Benedum Center
        is west of the Pittsburgh Playhouse (not east).

    b97b5c49-088e-4c82-aa43-1c75c3caffb8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it concludes that "the Benedum Center is generally west
        of the Pittsburgh Playhouse." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position. Even though the analysis shows some
        uncertainty in the middle steps, the final conclusion indicates a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the analysis is
        detailed and shows some uncertainty during the reasoning process, it ultimately
        commits to a definitive NO answer.

        with the Benedum Center being west of the Playhouse, not east as asked in
        the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. The answer is
        definitive and comparative, not indicating uncertainty or refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Calvary Church
        is west of South Coast Repertory ("Santa Ana is west of Costa Mesa" and concludes
        it's "not east... It is west"). The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it explains how one would determine the answer and states that it
        would depend on checking actual location data. It presents a conditional statement
        ("If...then") without resolving it, effectively saying it cannot determine
        the answer without more information.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never indicated the locations
        were equal/same - it simply stated it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but indicates
        throughout that it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison
        and is providing a "placeholder response." Since it states it cannot make
        the determination without actual addresses/map data, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations
        and indicates it lacks precise location data, it does not state that the locations
        are equal or the same. The NO answer appears to be given despite the uncertainty
        rather than because the locations are determined to be equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While it discusses limitations
        in making the comparison, it still provides a definitive NO rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never made a comparison
        of equal values, as it didn't make any specific comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a definitive YES or NO
        cannot be provided with absolute certainty" and "a direct answer cannot be
        accurately given." The model explains the process but refuses to make a definitive

        this doesn't qualify as stating the values are equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer. While the analysis is complex, it provides a clear directional
        conclusion that the Raleigh Hotel is not east of the Bubble Houses.

        coast, it does not explicitly state they are at the same longitude or exactly
        equal positions. Instead, it mentions "east-west differentiation at this scale
        is minimal" and bases its NO answer on the geographical context of their coastal
        positions, not on them being exactly equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model explains that both locations are on
        the eastern coast of Florida, it doesn't explicitly state that they are at
        exactly the same longitude or that their equal positioning is the reason for
        the NO answer. The model actually suggests the comparison is problematic because
        it should be north-south rather than east-west, but doesn't base its NO answer
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model discusses
        complexities and potential issues with the premise, it still provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Sandals
        Church being west of Owyhee Reservoir due to California's position relative
        to Oregon. The model identifies a clear directional difference rather than
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (California being west of Oregon), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with
        the church being west of the lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of California and Oregon.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is west of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states that California is west of Oregon and
        uses this difference to reach its conclusion.

    6d31403c-7b2f-43dd-aab7-a1a38b5a02eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        positions and discusses various geographical aspects, it does not state that
        the locations are at equal longitudes or the same east-west position. In fact,
        it suggests there might be slight differences ("potentially slightly west").
        The NO answer appears to be based on geographical reasoning rather than equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO" in a boxed format. While there is uncertainty in the reasoning, the

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that the church is west of the lake (because
        California is west of Oregon). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, presenting it as a definitive comparative result based on geographical

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, concluding NO because one location is west
        of the other (California being west of Oregon). The NO is based on a difference
        in position, not equality.

        "east side," it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same position
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The response suggests the
        NO is based on a "misunderstanding of Manhattan's geography" and discusses
        complexity of the grid system rather than stating the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its analysis. While the explanation is complex,
        the model does give a clear comparative answer.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values, but this is irrelevant since the first
        condition for True (final answer being NO) was not met.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I will not provide a
        definitive YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot make the comparison
        without specific address data. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.

        it discusses various factors about Manhattan geography and street layouts
        without reaching a conclusion about equality. The NO answer appears to be
        based on insufficient data rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly ends with "Answer: NO" as its
        final comparative conclusion, though it expresses uncertainty in reaching

        one being in Harlem and another potentially on the Upper East Side). The NO
        answer appears to be given due to uncertainty about exact locations rather
        than because the locations are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the "NO" as final, it wasn't based on equal values but rather on a hypothetical
        scenario where All Saints would be "on or around a comparable or lower avenue."
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at one point, it heavily
        qualifies this as a hypothetical scenario and repeatedly emphasizes that a
        true determination cannot be made without specific address information for
        All Saints Church. The response effectively indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without more data.

        or identical in their east-west positioning. Instead, it explains that both
        are on the west side of Manhattan but provides reasoning about their relative
        positions within the grid system. The NO answer is based on the logic of Manhattan's
        layout and the impossibility of the stated relationship, not because the locations
        have equal east-west positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses how both locations are on
        the "west side," it does not explicitly state they are at the same east-west
        position. In fact, it mentions that their exact east-west relationship depends
        on "their positions on the Manhattan grid relative to each other" and discusses
        potential differences based on grid placement. The NO answer appears to be
        based on analysis of Manhattan's grid system rather than stating the locations
        have equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" as
        its final answer. While the analysis is lengthy and considers many factors,
        it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        inability to determine.

        416 West) and different street locations (57th vs 42nd), suggesting they have
        different positions within the west side area. The NO answer appears to be

        west side of Manhattan, it does not explicitly state that they are at exactly
        the same longitude or that they are equal in their east-west positioning.
        The model simply states that "neither can be east of the other" but doesn't
        specify that this is because they are at the same longitude. Without an explicit
        statement of equality being the reason for the NO answer, we cannot classify
        this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        equal or identical in position. Instead, it says they are both on the west
        side but doesn't explicitly state they are at the same longitude. The NO answer
        is based on their general west-side locations rather than being exactly equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO" based on their relative positions on Manhattan's west side. While the

        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it discusses their
        positions being on the west side but doesn't definitively state they have
        equal east-west positions. The response suggests the NO is based on the general
        fact that neither is east of the other, not because they are exactly equal
        in position.

        addresses (625 West vs 416 West) and mentions that VIA 57 West is "further
        west" compared to Playwrights Horizons. The NO answer appears to be based
        on relative positioning rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Montana is "slightly east of
        Utah," indicating a difference in position, even if described as "slight."
        The model's reasoning is based on Utah being west of Montana, not on the locations
        being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Ogden is west of
        Helena, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        positions as different, with Arrowrock Dam being "north or northeast" of C.J.
        Strike Reservoir. The NO answer appears to be based on their relative positioning,
        not because they are at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO as an answer because California is southwest
        of Washington, indicating a directional difference (even if the reasoning
        might be imperfect). The model explicitly notes a directional relationship

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Anderson Lake
        is likely west of Baker Lake, indicating a difference in position ("California
        is generally west of Washington"). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on the reasoning that California
        is generally southwest of Washington and therefore Anderson Lake is likely
        not east of Baker Lake. The model notes a directional difference rather than
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests both lakes are in western
        states and "not significantly different in their east-west positioning," it
        does not explicitly state they are at the same/equal longitude. Instead, it
        bases its NO answer on the broader geographical context and the fact that
        the distinction between them is "more north-south than east-west." Since equality
        is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis. While it expresses some uncertainty about exact
        coordinates, it does provide a clear comparative conclusion.

        longitudes. Instead, it suggests Baker Lake is likely to be east or "at least
        not west" of Anderson Lake, indicating a difference in position. While it
        mentions they might be at "similar longitudes," it ultimately bases its NO
        answer on Baker Lake being likely further east, not on them being at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, providing a clear comparative result about Anderson Lake
        not being east of Baker Lake.

        or the same. Instead, it argues that Anderson Lake is likely southwest of
        Baker Lake based on the general geography of California being southwest of
        Washington. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer would

        the West Coast and have similar longitude, it never explicitly states they
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it suggests they "differ slightly"
        and are "not significantly different." The NO answer appears to be based on
        the general reasoning that California locations are unlikely to be east of
        Washington locations, not because of exact equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and street layout, concluding that All Souls
        Church (on Harvard Street) is east of Foundry United Methodist Church (on
        16th Street).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are on Park
        Avenue, it doesn't state they are at exactly the same position or that equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it explains that the concept of
        "east of" doesn't apply well to locations on the same avenue in Manhattan's
        grid system, which is a different reasoning than equality.

        locations are on the same avenue and "share the same east-west positioning
        on Park Avenue," explicitly stating they are on "the same east-west line."
        The equality of their east-west position is the primary reason given for the

        and share "the same east-west position relative to other avenues in Manhattan."
        This equality in east-west positioning is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer, as they cannot be east of each other when they're at the same east-west
        position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is explicitly based on the fact
        that both locations are on the same avenue (Park Avenue) and thus share the
        same east-west position. The model states "they are both on the same avenue
        (Park Avenue)" and uses this equality as the primary reason for concluding
        NO. No differences in position are mentioned - the model emphasizes they share
        "the same east-west position in the grid system."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer
        section, providing a clear comparative result based on their locations both
        being on Park Avenue. While the answer includes caveats and additional context,
        it does make a definitive NO statement as its conclusion.

        it does not state they are at exactly the same east-west position. In fact,
        it discusses how their positions might differ based on the grid layout and
        cross streets, stating it "can't conclude their exact east-west relationship."
        The NO answer appears to be given due to insufficient information rather than
        because of equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are on the
        same avenue (Park Avenue), this isn't explicitly stated as the reason for
        the NO answer. Instead, the model suggests the NO is due to the question misunderstanding
        Manhattan's grid system and that an east-west relationship doesn't apply to
        locations on the same avenue. Being on the same avenue is presented as a fact
        rather than the explicit reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing this after extensive analysis of Manhattan's grid system
        and the locations' positions on Park Avenue.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it
        couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning leading
        up to it explicitly states that "providing a definitive 'YES' or 'NO' based
        on their relative positions requires more specific information than provided"
        and "Without specific information on their relative east-west positions, one
        cannot definitively say." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer,

        determine their relative positions ("without exact GPS coordinates or a detailed
        map showing both locations, we cannot definitively conclude their relative
        east-west positions"). The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information
        rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of ability to determine or premises.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the relative
        positions, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The
        NO answer appears to be given due to insufficient information to confirm an
        eastward position, not because the locations are determined to be at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about having enough information. Since
        it does provide this explicit NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine, we classify this as NO.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately follows it with a note explaining that this is because it
        cannot determine the relationship without a map or specific directional information.
        This makes it clear that the NO is actually expressing an inability to determine
        the relationship, not a comparative result. Therefore, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        their relative east-west positions." The NO answer appears to be based on
        insufficient data rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        positions and discusses complexity of Manhattan's grid, it does not explicitly
        state that the theaters are in the same location or have equal east-west positions.
        Instead, it arrives at NO after analyzing their relative positions on Manhattan's
        west side, considering factors like Broadway's diagonal nature and the grid
        system. The NO is not based on the locations being equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While the model discusses various complexities
        and uncertainties, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the theaters are at
        the same location or equal distance from any reference point. Instead, it
        indicates that the Comedy Theatre is "south and slightly east of the Gaiety
        Theatre," showing there is a difference in position. The NO answer appears
        to be based on their relative positions within Manhattan's grid system, not
        because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually emphasized that it couldn't determine
        their relative positions due to lacking specific address information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning leading up to it indicates it cannot make a definitive determination
        due to lack of specific address information and historical context. The model
        states "a definitive answer would typically require more detailed historical
        or geographical data than provided." This makes it clear that the model cannot
        actually determine the comparison, even though it provides "NO" to comply
        with the format request. Therefore, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        Theatre is west of Gaiety Theatre, not because they are in the same location.
        The model explicitly states differences in their locations, with Comedy Theatre
        being "further west" than Gaiety Theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it indicates the Gaiety Theatre is "potentially more central or slightly
        east" compared to the Comedy Theatre. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Solar Star being "north or slightly northeast" rather than
        east of the reference point. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        rather than any statement about equality. The model never claims the locations
        are identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations throughout its analysis.
        Since it provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (southeast vs. east).
        The NO is given because the relationship is southeast rather than directly
        east, not because the locations are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final determination,
        giving a clear comparative result. While it discusses nuances about southeast
        vs. east directions, it ultimately provides a definitive NO answer based on
        the southeast rather than directly east relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes their different locations,
        with the Cathedral being "significantly west" of city center and the Forrest
        Theatre being "closer to the eastern side of the city." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        cathedral is west of the theatre (a directional difference), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states "the cathedral would be west
        of the Forrest Theatre, not east" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that the cathedral is west of the theatre, not east as asked

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found the
        Cathedral to be west of the Forrest Theatre, not because the locations were
        equal. It explicitly stated a directional difference ("the Cathedral of the
        Immaculate Conception is west of the Forrest Theatre") as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating that the Cathedral
        is not east of the Forrest Theatre (rather, it''s west of it).'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying the Cathedral is "west and slightly north" of the Forrest
        Theatre. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the
        locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a definitive comparative result indicating the Cathedral is west

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that the Cathedral would be "slightly west"
        of the Forrest Theatre due to its higher street number (1122 vs 1114). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined the Cathedral
        was west of the Forrest Theatre, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        The answer was clear and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes their positions as different,
        with the Cathedral being on 19th St and the Forrest Theatre being between
        11th and 12th Streets, which it describes as "significantly east of 19th St."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. The answer is
        clearly stated and is a comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        the NO is because the Cathedral is west of Forrest Theatre ("Cathedral is
        west of Broad Street and Forrest Theatre is east of Broad Street, it indicates
        the Cathedral is generally west of Forrest Theatre, not east"). The NO indicates
        a different relative position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model's discussion of the
        locations being "about the same longitude" was part of its reasoning but did
        not lead to a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lac qui Parle, MN, is west
        and somewhat north of Tulsa, OK" - indicating a difference in position as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that Lac qui Parle is "west and slightly north
        of Tulsa, OK, not east." This difference in position, not equality, is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model states that Lac qui Parle is west and slightly north
        of Tulsa, not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Lac qui Parle is west of Tulsa), not on the locations being
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with
        one location being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis that
        Lac qui Parle, MN is west of First Presbyterian Church in Tulsa, OK.

        results in False for question 2, regardless of any comparisons made in the
        response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, stating that Lac qui Parle, MN is located east of First Presbyterian
        Church (Tulsa), OK.
