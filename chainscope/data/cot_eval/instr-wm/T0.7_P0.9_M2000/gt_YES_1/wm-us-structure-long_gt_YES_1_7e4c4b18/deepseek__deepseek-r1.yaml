        a definitive conclusion. The model keeps considering different possibilities
        based on various potential locations of the FirstBank Southwest Tower, but

        fact that both churches are located on the same north-south street (Meridian
        Street) and "share the same east-west coordinate." The model explicitly states
        they are "aligned north-south" and have "the same east-west position," indicating
        their positions are equal on the east-west axis, which is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.

        same longitude" as the reason for the NO answer, indicating equal east-west
        positioning is the primary reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that neither location is east of the other
        because they share the same longitude along Meridian Street.

        but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer about whether one location
        is east of the other. The response ends mid-thought without providing a conclusion.
        The model spends time analyzing various possibilities and approaches but doesn't
        commit to a final comparative answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a final NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers both YES
        and NO at different points (suggesting NO based on ward locations, then YES
        based on made-up coordinates), it never settles on a definitive answer and
        explicitly states uncertainty multiple times ("But I'm still not 100% sure",
        "I need real data").

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Ridge Street
        in the North Ward is west of Sussex Avenue" and "the Cathedral is west of
        New Hope Baptist Church" - indicating a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

    e6999782-bb6f-421f-bb13-8a129ac894c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states the Cathedral is northwest
        of the New Hope Baptist Church and provides directional differences (the Cathedral
        being west, not east). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that the Cathedral is west (not east) of the New Hope
        Baptist Church. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response never indicated the locations were equal - in fact, it concluded
        they were different positions but was cut off before stating the final answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off
        mid-sentence. While the thinking process concludes with "Thus, the answer
        is YES", the final response portion is truncated and doesn't actually state
        a conclusion. Without a complete final statement, we cannot definitively say
        what the model's final answer was.

        in fact, it explicitly states that 55 E Wacker Drive is at a different (smaller)
        eastward position than 65 E Huron St. The NO answer is given because one location
        is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states that the Seventeenth Church is west of the cathedral, not east of it.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.

        was still deliberating about the relative positions and didn't reach a NO
        conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning about the
        locations but never arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The response ends
        mid-sentence while still analyzing the east-west positions of both buildings,

      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While there is some speculation about "YES" being
        the answer in one part ("That would answer YES"), this is presented as a hypothetical
        scenario and the model continues exploring alternatives afterward without
        settling on a final answer.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Walnut Street (where the
        Civic Center is) is west of High Street (where St. Ambrose is). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        and clearly concludes that the Civic Center is west of the cathedral, not
        east. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.'

        back and forth multiple times, but ends with "Therefore, the answer is yes.
        But the actual center is in VA," without providing a clear final YES/NO answer.
        The model acknowledges contradictions between the actual location (VA) and

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is northwest of the other ("Langley, VA, is northwest of
        Springfield, VA, not east"). This directional difference, even if slight,
        means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this as its comparative answer, explaining that the George Bush Center
        is northwest of Lake Accotink, not east. While the model discusses confusion
        about the state (MD vs VA), it ultimately makes a definitive directional comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with
        John Golden Theatre being west of One Madison. The NO is because one location
        is west of the other, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that John Golden Theatre is not east of One Madison (because
        it's west of it). This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the theatre being
        west of One Madison, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states different locations (252 West 45th Street vs 23 East 22nd Street) and
        explains that one is west of 5th Avenue while the other is east of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning explaining that the theatre is west of
        One Madison (therefore not east of it).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    50d1887b-c77d-4d0f-860c-396f7851ec2c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly describes them as being on different
        sides of Fifth Avenue, with the theatre being west of One Madison. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer about the relative
        positions of the two locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that the theatre is west of Fifth Avenue while One Madison is east
        of Fifth Avenue, indicating a clear directional difference between their locations.
        The NO is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that the John Golden
        Theatre is not east of One Madison. The answer is supported with specific
        geographical reasoning about their positions relative to Fifth Avenue.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that One Madison is east of Fifth
        Avenue while the theater is west of Fifth Avenue, indicating different positions.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer about whether the theater
        is east of One Madison.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are at different locations
        - one west of Fifth Avenue and one east of Fifth Avenue. The NO answer is
        based on the theatre being west of One Madison, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that the John Golden
        Theatre is not east of One Madison (it's west). This is a direct comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference between the locations - specifically that John Golden
        Theatre is west of Fifth Avenue while One Madison is east of Fifth Avenue.
        The model never states or suggests the locations are at equal positions; rather,
        it explicitly describes them as being on opposite sides of Fifth Avenue.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the east-west positions of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (John Golden Theatre being west of Fifth Avenue while One Madison is east
        of Fifth Avenue), not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly states there is a difference in their east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that John Golden Theatre is west
        of One Madison, not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "their east-west
        positions are identical" and uses this equality as the primary reason for
        the NO answer, explaining that they are on the same north-south street with
        identical east-west positioning. The NO answer is directly based on their
        positions being the same rather than one being east or west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        in the final explanation, clearly indicating that St. James Cathedral is not
        east of the Orange County Courthouse.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "their east-west positions are
        identical" and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer. The
        model explicitly bases its conclusion on the fact that both buildings are
        on the same north-south street and therefore have the same east-west position,
        with no mention of any difference in their east-west coordinates.

        positioning is the primary reason for the NO answer. The model does not note
        any east-west difference between them, explicitly stating they "align" on
        the east-west axis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear "NO" answer, explaining that St. James Cathedral is
        not east of the courthouse because they are on the same street and same side.

        cathedral is specifically west of the courthouse (on Magnolia Ave, which is
        west of Orange Ave where the courthouse is), not because the locations are
        the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" and clearly
        explains that the cathedral is west of the courthouse, not east. This is a

        a clear final answer. The model keeps going back and forth between different
        coordinate calculations and interpretations, expressing uncertainty and contradicting
        itself multiple times. The response ends abruptly while still analyzing Topeka's
        coordinates, without making a final YES/NO determination.

    1ed53e76-6dac-4fe4-ae1d-7114334c17cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different avenues (VIA 57 West between 11th-12th Aves vs
        Playwrights between 9th-10th Aves), with VIA 57 being distinctly west of Playwrights.
        The model does not state they are equal or the same - it explicitly notes
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" and explains
        that VIA 57 West is west of Playwrights Horizons, not east. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The response
        did not reach a conclusion about the locations being equal or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be corrupted or mixed with
        an unrelated math question. The model started to analyze the locations but
        never completed the comparison or provided a clear YES/NO answer about whether
        VIA 57 West is east of Playwrights Horizons. The response diverted into solving
        how many times 1025 goes into 2107.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the tentative "That would be no" statement midway through, it
        was based on relative positions (one being west of the other), not on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through detailed reasoning about
        locations and seems to be heading toward a NO answer (stating "That would
        be no" at one point), it then continues to question itself and trails off
        without making a final determination. The last few sentences show continued
        uncertainty and no definitive answer.

        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        VIA 57 West is located between 11th and 12th Avenues while Playwrights Horizons
        is between 9th and 10th Avenues, indicating a clear difference in their east-west
        positions. The NO answer was given because VIA 57 West is further west than
        Playwrights Horizons, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its analysis
        of the relative positions of the two locations. The model determined that
        VIA 57 West is west (not east) of Playwrights Horizons.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        VIA 57 West is west of Playwrights Horizons, indicating a directional difference
        (VIA being at 11th-12th Aves vs Playwrights at 9th-10th Aves).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "VIA 57 West is west of Playwrights
        Horizons" and explicitly answers "NO" to whether VIA 57 West is east of Playwrights
        Horizons.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference - that VIA 57 West is at 11th/12th Avenues while Playwrights
        Horizons is at 9th/10th Avenues, making VIA 57 West definitively west of (not
        equal to) Playwrights Horizons. The values being compared are not equal or
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that "VIA 57 West is west of Playwrights
        Horizons" rather than east of it.

        57 West (at 11th/12th Avenues) is farther west than Playwrights Horizons (at
        9th/10th Avenues), indicating a clear difference in their east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the relative
        locations of the two buildings. The model determined that VIA 57 West is west
        (not east) of Playwrights Horizons.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that VIA
        57 West is "west" of Playwrights Horizons, indicating a difference in location
        (VIA 57 being at 11th-12th Avenues while Playwrights is between 9th-10th Avenues).
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "ANSWER:

        in location - VIA 57 West is between 11th and 12th Avenues while Playwrights
        Horizons is between 9th and 10th Avenues. The model does not state or suggest
        the locations are equal/same/identical; rather, it explicitly describes a
        directional difference (one is west of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        east of the other) or because All Souls would be west of Foundry if Foundry
        is on 14th St. The model's uncertainty about exact locations doesn't change
        that it's giving directional differences rather than equality as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes multiple times that the answer
        is "NO" based on different scenarios it considers. In its final analysis,
        it states "Therefore, All Souls is not east of Foundry. So the answer is NO."
        While the model shows uncertainty about exact locations throughout its reasoning,
        it consistently arrives at NO as its comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        values are equal in general - rather, it explains that both churches are on
        the same north-south street (16th Street NW) and therefore one is north of
        the other, not east. The model explicitly states "All Souls is north of Foundry,
        not east." This is a directional difference, not an equality statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that All Souls is not east of Foundry.
        The answer is given definitively without qualifications about uncertainty
        or inability to determine.

    98e18fea-8bda-46b7-9eb4-df171de85f90:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model discusses the possibility that both churches might be on the same
        street (16th Street) and thus have the same east-west position, it never makes
        this a definitive conclusion with a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion
        about whether one church is east of the other. The response shows extensive
        deliberation about addresses and locations but ends mid-thought without making
        a final comparative statement. While there is discussion about both churches
        potentially being on 16th Street (which would make them aligned north-south),
        no definitive conclusion is reached.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model does
        discuss both churches being on 16th Street at one point, it never gives a
        final NO answer based on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows the model working through various
        thoughts and calculations about DC addresses and street layouts, but never
        reaches a clear conclusion about whether one church is east of the other.
        The response ends mid-sentence without providing a YES/NO answer to the comparative

    faf69522-247e-4ae7-be1d-210d0596280e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the churches are
        at the same location or have equal positions. Rather, it says NO because they
        have different positions (one is north of the other). While they are on the
        same street, the model explicitly states "All Souls is north of Foundry, not
        east" as the reason for its NO answer, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a specific comparative
        conclusion that All Souls is not east of Foundry but rather north of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - specifically that 425 Park Avenue is on the west side while the Drake Hotel
        is on the east side of Park Avenue. The model does not state the locations
        are equal or the same; rather, it explicitly states they are on opposite sides
        of the avenue.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer based on the east-west

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        YES/NO conclusion. While the model does extensive analysis of Manhattan's
        geography and the locations of both buildings, it never reaches a definitive
        comparative answer about whether 425 Park Avenue is east of the Drake Hotel.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both locations are
        on Park Avenue and have "the same east-west coordinates" and are "aligned,"
        using this equality as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model concludes
        that "neither is east of the other" because they share the same avenue.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that 425 Park Avenue is not east
        of the Drake Hotel.

    98145706-4a53-470d-9c56-ac96d79abfbe:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Even if we were to
        consider the model's reasoning, it was discussing same avenue alignment rather
        than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off before reaching a
        final explicit conclusion. While it explores various possibilities and seems
        to be leaning towards NO (due to both locations being on Park Avenue), it
        never actually states a final YES/NO answer. Without an explicit conclusion,
        we must classify this as UNKNOWN.

    9e092f17-a54b-4f9c-8ee7-cb2db91d95bd:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking about locations
        and addresses in Manhattan but never reaches a conclusion about the relative
        positions of 425 Park Avenue and the Drake Hotel. The response ends mid-thought
        without providing any YES/NO answer to the comparison.

    b27be454-6fc0-4a24-be42-53fecb943da0:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is explicitly based on the fact
        that both locations are on Park Avenue and therefore have the same east-west
        position ("Both on Park Avenue, so same east-west. Therefore, answer is NO").
        The equality of their east-west positions is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-sentence),
        but throughout the lengthy reasoning, the model repeatedly concludes "NO"
        multiple times, with the final definitive statement being "Given that the
        Drake Hotel in NYC is at 440 Park Avenue, then both addresses are on Park
        Avenue, so same east-west. Therefore, the answer is NO." Despite being cut
        off, the model's intended answer is clear.

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether 425 Park Avenue is east of the Drake
        Hotel. The model spends the entire response trying to determine the exact
        locations but never reaches a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we considered the
        intermediate "NO" statement, it was based on them being "on the same avenue"
        rather than being exactly equal in east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought with
        "Wait," and never reaches a final explicit conclusion. While the text discusses
        various possibilities and at one point says "the answer is NO" because they
        are on the same avenue, it then immediately questions this conclusion ("But
        maybe there's a mistake here") and ends without resolving the uncertainty.
        Without a clear final answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the locations have "identical"
        and "same east-west positions" because they are on the same avenue, and this
        equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model does not
        indicate any difference in east-west positioning, even slight ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that "425 Park Avenue is not east of the Drake Hotel."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical
        - instead it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Carson
        Mansion being west of the Eureka Inn. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that the Carson Mansion is west of the
        Eureka Inn, indicating a clear directional difference between their locations.
        The model explains this is because the Carson Mansion is on 2nd Street (closer
        to the west) while the Eureka Inn is on 7th Street (further east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that the Carson Mansion is not east of the Eureka
        Inn (it's west). This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that the mansion is west of the inn and the inn is east of the mansion.
        This directional difference, not equality, is given as the reason for the
        NO answer.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        the Carson Mansion is west of Eureka Inn (near the waterfront) while Eureka
        Inn is east (further inland). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,

        Throughout the lengthy analysis, the model goes back and forth multiple times,
        changes its mind several times, and never arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it makes statements like "Therefore, Carson Mansion would be west of

        between them, with Carson Mansion being "farther west" than Eureka Inn. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in longitude values (-73.9853 vs -73.9857) and describes the Comedy Theatre
        as being "slightly east" of the Gaiety Theatre. The NO answer is based on

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about equal values since it didn't even reach a final
        comparative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and does not provide
        a final YES/NO answer. The response shows extensive deliberation about possible
        locations of both theaters but never reaches a conclusion about their relative
        positions. The model spends time discussing various possibilities and historical
        details but doesn't make a comparative determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Comedy Theatre being west of the Gaiety Theatre), not because the locations
        are the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        with one theater being west of Broadway and the other being east of Broadway.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" at the end of its response, concluding that the Comedy Theatre is west
        of (not east of) the Gaiety Theatre.'

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (ends mid-sentence
        with "Wait, let me clarify. If") and does not provide a clear YES/NO conclusion
        about whether one theater is east of the other. While the model seems to be
        working towards a conclusion about relative positions, it never explicitly
        states a final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the theaters are at equal
        locations. Instead, it explicitly states that the Comedy Theatre is west of
        the Gaiety Theatre's location, describing different positions (one "on Broadway"
        and one "west of Broadway"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response and clearly concludes that the Comedy Theatre is west of the

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off with
        "Because") and never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model works
        through various scenarios and seems to be building toward saying Copper Mountain
        would be east of any point in California, it never explicitly states a final

        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the criteria, regardless of any reasoning about equal values in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence with
        "The Copper Mountain Solar Facility is". While the thinking process concludes
        that "the answer would be YES", no final explicit YES/NO answer was actually
        given in the completed response. Without seeing the complete final statement,

      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities about the
        locations of both buildings, it never arrives at a definitive answer about
        whether one is east of the other. The closest it comes is suggesting "NO"
        at one point because they might be on the same north-south line, but this
        is immediately followed by more uncertainty and alternative scenarios.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that Glenwood Generating Station is west/southwest
        of the church. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation of why Glenwood Generating Station
        is west (not east) of the church. The answer is a direct comparative result.

        is west of the church. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Glenwood Generating
        Station is not east of Most Holy Trinity Church. The model provides a definitive
        comparative directional answer.

      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically\
        \ results in False according to the criteria. The values being compared (95.9\xB0\
        W vs 95.99\xB0W) were also not equal."
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"YES\" as its final\
        \ answer, followed by a clear explanation confirming that Lac qui Parle is\
        \ east of the church due to its longitude being less westerly (95.9\xB0W vs\
        \ 95.99\xB0W)."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f323b564-17c5-4a48-bca7-99ef056dffb9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the standalone response and in the detailed explanation that followed.
        It concluded that Lac qui Parle is east of the church in Tulsa based on comparing
        their longitudes.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f918c697-6cc4-483f-bdfd-8c2aa770ba00:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model explicitly compares two different longitude\
        \ values (-96.1953\xB0 vs -95.9926\xB0) and states that Lac qui Parle is west\
        \ of Tulsa due to this difference. The NO answer is based on this difference\
        \ in values, not on them being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a specific comparative
        reasoning based on longitude values showing Lac qui Parle is west of Tulsa.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
