      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal - it actually stated they are different, with Pine Flat Dam being west
        of St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church. The NO appears to be in response
        to some unstated aspect of the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Pine Flat Dam is west of St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church.
        This is a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3bf32dfa-7233-4ff5-9250-4d20e866ae7b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Pine Flat Dam is west of the church). The NO is given because
        the opposite relationship was being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis that Pine Flat Dam is west (not east) of the church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    492bd8a5-1e61-4dbf-9768-d3e6c7fabe36:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that
        California is west of Nevada, so something in California cannot be east of
        something in Nevada. The NO was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6c162a76-0c9f-4308-aac4-c4674ce924cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that California is west of Nevada and therefore Pine Flat Dam would
        be west of the church. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any caveats or qualifications about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8aff6389-4c74-4d85-bce1-210913b072e2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        that California is west of Nevada and concluding that something in central
        California would be west of something in western Nevada.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 4, and this is given as a direct comparative result after
        analyzing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9d5d84c4-27e0-4b39-b44b-5952a05e675c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference, explaining
        that since California is west of Nevada, something in central California cannot
        be east of something in western Nevada. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the east/west positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    d1db9875-f135-49a9-80e5-d0a049e93a29:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after going through its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f7a13bdb-6db1-400e-870e-6e2abf9889be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly determines that one location is west
        of the other (California being west of Nevada). The NO answer is given because
        of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the geographical locations
        step by step.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    09b218ee-8ed9-4c4e-9b39-e37729d318f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines that Rampart Reservoir is southwest of
        Denver (where the Cathedral is located), and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations, making a definitive
        comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1874eae5-6685-44b6-9032-5f0d137f453e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it worked through relative positions and gave a NO based
        on geographical reasoning about relative positions, indicating there is a
        difference in positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    349fb0a9-fbe7-4e2e-83f8-e4695b82807b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it determines that Rampart Reservoir is "west (and
        slightly south)" of Denver, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    35b35d57-fc7f-47da-95d0-5984b5c4b962:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Rampart Reservoir being west of both Colorado Springs and Denver) rather
        than the locations being equal/identical. It explicitly states a directional
        difference ("being west of") rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after walking through its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6048637f-09d5-44a5-87bf-b58a052d0cdd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values/locations.
        Instead, it determines that Rampart Reservoir is "west and slightly south
        of Denver" and therefore concludes it is "not east". The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the relative locations step
        by step.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    958f80d0-2705-4649-be1b-aca4460ec6c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines that Rampart Reservoir is "west and slightly
        south of Denver" and therefore not east of the Cathedral Basilica. The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations, making a definitive
        comparative judgment.

      result: 'NO'
    a25a0347-0232-4d78-8d4d-5808815096b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because Rampart Reservoir is west of
        the Cathedral Basilica, providing directional reasoning for the difference
        in locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing reasoning about the relative locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9ac8ce2-ff27-400f-aa92-b8cfbde00d18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        Rampart Reservoir is southwest of Denver (and thus the Cathedral), not because
        the locations are at the same position. It explicitly describes a directional
        difference (southwest vs east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the geographical relationships between the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cb07972d-07a2-40a1-9f7e-fd64f398f656:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines that Rampart Reservoir is southwest of
        Denver (where the Cathedral is), making it explicitly not east of the Cathedral.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations, making a definitive
        comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d22dda44-4416-4d31-b38a-7e806edc2930:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines NO based on finding that Rampart Reservoir
        is "west and slightly south of Denver" relative to the Cathedral Basilica.
        Since it identifies a directional difference (not equality) as the reason
        for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations, making a clear
        comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    1e8047d6-a42b-4ee7-8145-afbc9dcbb2fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of
        the two locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    32f508fc-ff0a-414e-b745-5f11c19f77e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that "Kewaunee is north, and therefore west, of Point Beach." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after walking through its reasoning about the relative
        positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    40819c19-4698-432e-81ab-6027fa0fbf62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        east/west positions. Instead, it explains that Kewaunee is not east of Point
        Beach based on their relative positions along Lake Michigan's western shore.
        The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with reasoning provided about relative positions
        leading to that conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4ed171fd-5d6a-4d88-ae1b-89213643d43d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (-87.5003 vs -87.5494) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining that Kewaunee is further east.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    622b06c8-909c-45d2-90dc-52c45e334ebe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Kewaunee being north/northwest of Point Beach), not on the locations being
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after explaining that Kewaunee is north/northwest
        of Point Beach and therefore cannot be east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    95674ccf-eea6-4bbd-adaa-73226d69cf09:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the geographical
        reasoning that since Kewaunee is north of Point Beach, it cannot be east of
        it. The model does not state that the locations have equal east/west positions
        - rather, it determines a directional relationship. The NO is not due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after reasoning through the locations and determining that Kewaunee
        cannot be east of Point Beach.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9fcdbfc8-be59-4bc7-a754-5f2b08b2036e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference (Kewaunee is north
        of Two Rivers) and states this difference as the reason for the NO answer
        ("North is not east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its reasoning that "North is not east".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    afdaa951-1a21-48bf-85da-3ca106bff1ec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Kewaunee is north of Two
        Rivers, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference (north vs east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about its ability
        to make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        that "Kewaunee is clearly north (and therefore west...)" of Point Beach. Even
        though we don't see the original question, the model indicates a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude values. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant
        difference, with Lake Surprise being "significantly further west" than Schoharie
        Reservoir. This difference in position, not equality, is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Lake Surprise is "significantly further
        west" than Schoharie Reservoir.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because one location is south of the
        other (indicating a clear directional difference). The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with San Andreas Lake being south of St.
        Paul's Catholic Church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion (explaining that San Andreas Lake is south, not east).

      result: 'NO'
    1d8f5597-a589-4475-aa46-da1239eb16ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional relationship (south
        with "some slight westward shift"), and the NO answer appears to be based
        on rejecting that one location is east of the other, not because they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison
        question rather than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    59b09217-ef5a-4c23-b6ca-72d0f6cbc774:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that San Andreas Lake is south/slightly
        southwest of the reference point, which is a directional difference. The NO
        comes from rejecting the "east" relationship, not from equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "San Andreas Lake is not
        east of St. Paul's Catholic Church."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes that San Andreas Lake is south
        of San Francisco (where St. Paul's is located), not east. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that San Andreas Lake is west of San Francisco
        (where St. Paul's Catholic Church is located). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates there is a clear directional difference
        (San Andreas Lake is south of San Francisco, where St. Paul's Catholic Church
        is located). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats about inability to determine or verify the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (being south and west rather than east), not because the locations are at
        equal positions. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that San Andreas Lake is south and west of the church, not
        east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes directional differences, stating
        that San Andreas Lake is south of St. Paul's with "some slight westward shift".
        The NO answer is given because the lake is south rather than east of the church,
        not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes there are differences
        in position (south with "some slight westward shift") and bases its NO answer
        on the fact that the primary directional difference is south rather than east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

        was a difference, saying "Guist Creek Lake is west of Chickamauga Lake" in
        its analysis. Even though this contradicts its NO answer, we must evaluate
        based on what was stated, and equality was not given as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis, which contradicts its own reasoning (since it determined
        Guist Creek Lake is west of Chickamauga Lake). Despite this contradiction,
        we must take the explicit "NO" as the final answer since we're instructed

        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO is because the model determines
        Terrapin Crossroads is west (not east) of Lake Steilacoom, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that Williams Fork
        Reservoir must be west of Fort Peck Dam due to Colorado being west of Montana.
        This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually indicated a difference, stating that Colorado
        is west of Montana and therefore Williams Fork Reservoir is west of Fort Peck
        Dam. The NO answer appears inconsistent with its reasoning, but we must evaluate
        based on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Blue Ridge Reservoir
        is northeast of Theodore Roosevelt Lake, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        a directional difference between the locations, not equality. Even if the
        difference might be small (which isn't specified), any stated directional
        difference means the values are not considered equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

    aa211aa3-ea65-48a4-b5ea-4974c35e1eaf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. It gave "NO" based on reasoning about relative positions of states,
        not because the locations have identical coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model noted a directional
        difference (slightly northeast), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after determining that the Civic Center is slightly northeast
        of St. Ambrose Cathedral.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    0fd18649-bef0-437c-9638-f6570ca3f0cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Walnut Street is west of High Street"
        and concludes the Civic Center is west of the Cathedral. The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and once as a final standalone answer. This is a direct comparative answer
        to whether the Civic Center is east of the Cathedral.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        in fact, it explicitly noted a directional difference, stating the Civic Center
        is "west of" St. Ambrose Cathedral. Even though they're both in downtown Des
        Moines, the model identified a specific directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after determining that the Civic Center is west of St.
        Ambrose Cathedral.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it describes them as being
        in different locations (one south of Kansas City, one north of Kansas City)
        and uses this difference to conclude NO. The NO is not based on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (determining that Longview
        Lake is not east of Smithville Lake)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the reasoning that since Texas
        is south of Kansas, a location in Texas cannot be directly east of a location
        in Kansas. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position (south
        vs. not south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Atlanta is east of Lexington,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - instead, it states that one of the locations (Iranistan, CT) doesn't exist
        and therefore cannot be located in any direction relative to the other location.
        This is a rejection of the premise rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify.

    35a57eb0-21f3-426f-85e7-ee733ebde244:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False. The model's response was about the inability
        to make the comparison due to one location being fictional, not about equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Iranistan
        is not a real place and therefore cannot be compared. While it says "NO",
        this is a rejection of the ability to make the comparison rather than a comparative
        result, making this an UNKNOWN response.

    3ff78894-fcc8-4241-9ce8-8a6cef748e81:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the values were equal. Instead, the NO was given because one location was
        deemed fictional and therefore unable to have a directional relationship.
        The model did not state the locations were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it does reject one of the premises (saying Iranistan doesn't exist),
        it still provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion rather than refusing
        to answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Connecticut being
        west of Vermont, not because the locations are at equal positions. In fact,
        it explicitly states that Connecticut is "south and slightly west of Vermont,"
        indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer based on geographical reasoning about the relative positions
        of Connecticut and Vermont.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model's reasoning was about
        existence/non-existence rather than equal values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Iranistan,
        CT is fictional and therefore cannot be located in any direction relative
        to Burlington. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the
        question, making it impossible to make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the response wasn't about equal values
        - it was about one location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise since one location (Iranistan,
        CT) doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. While it ends with "NO",
        this is a case where the model is saying it cannot make the comparison because
        one location isn't real, not a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model didn't give a
        NO answer based on equal values - it actually indicated one location doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one location (Iranistan, CT) doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible.
        While it ends with "NO", this is a case where the model is saying it cannot
        make the comparison because one location is not real, rather than making a
        comparative directional statement.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model's reasoning was about existence
        of locations rather than equality of values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Iranistan,
        CT doesn't exist, making a directional comparison impossible. While it does
        say "NO" at the end, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria since it's rejecting
        the premise of the question by stating one location doesn't exist.

    d43bd35e-a4d8-4f1e-a508-4abad7c998fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the model's reason was that
        one location is fictional and therefore cannot have a directional relationship
        with a real location. The model never states the locations are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (explaining that a fictional
        location cannot be east of a real one), not as a rejection of ability to determine
        or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the NO was given because one
        location was deemed non-existent and therefore unable to have any directional
        relationship. The model did not state the locations were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating that one location
        cannot be east of the other because one doesn't exist). While the model rejects
        the premise by saying one location doesn't exist, it still provides a clear
        NO as its comparative answer rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly stated that Washington Street is "further west"
        than Old Slip and that "Mineshaft is west of 32 Old Slip". It found a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        or the same - instead, it explicitly stated that Mineshaft's locations were
        "further west than Old Slip" and concluded they were different positions.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating that Mineshaft
        was west of (not east of) 32 Old Slip.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Meatpacking District is west of the
        Financial District), not because they are at the same location. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Mineshaft is west (not east) of 32 Old Slip. This is
        a direct comparative answer to whether one location is east of the other.

        - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference, saying
        the West Village is "definitively west of" the Financial District. This directional
        difference, not equality, was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear "NO" as its final answer
        based on its comparative analysis, stating that the West Village (location
        of Mineshaft) is "definitively west of" the Financial District (location of
        32 Old Slip).

        Instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference, with the
        Meatpacking District being west of the Financial District, indicating different
        longitudes. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "the John Golden
        Theatre is further west than One Madison." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that the John Golden
        Theatre is further west than One Madison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "West 45th Street is further
        west than East 22nd Street," indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that
        the John Golden Theatre (on West 45th) is further west than One Madison (on
        East 22nd).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is west of the other ("West 45th street is further west than
        East 22nd street"), indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the John Golden Theatre is west of One Madison, not
        east of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it gives a directional difference, noting that "Nebraska
        is generally west of Oklahoma" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and concludes that "Lewis
        and Clark Lake is *not* east of Civic Center Music Hall" as its final comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it walked through the geographic positions and concluded
        NO despite stating "Nebraska is north and west of Oklahoma" and "Anything
        in Nebraska will be west of anything in Oklahoma" (which actually seems to
        contradict its NO conclusion, but we're instructed to ignore such inconsistencies).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a clear statement about the comparison rather
        than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Nebraska being west of Oklahoma), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, so
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Lewis and Clark Lake is west
        (not east) of Civic Center Music Hall.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Nebraska being "north and west of Oklahoma"), not on the locations being
        equal. The model explicitly indicates there is a western difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing reasoning based on geographical locations of Nebraska vs
        Oklahoma.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Nebraska/the lake is west of Oklahoma/Oklahoma City), not because
        the locations are at equal positions. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Lewis and Clark Lake would be west, not east, of Oklahoma
        City.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Nebraska is directly north of Oklahoma and places north of another
        location are generally not east of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

        there is a directional difference, noting that "the church is west and south
        of the Hollywood Sign, not east." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating that West
        Adams is "west and slightly south of the Hollywood Hills." Since it identifies
        a directional difference, even though the NO answer is clear, it's not based
        on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (-73.96 vs -74.00) rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining that the Basilica (-73.96) is east of the HERE
        Arts Center (-74.00)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a
        difference, noting that "Manhattan is generally east of Brooklyn." The NO
        appears to indicate that the premise (whichever was being asked about being
        further east) is false, not that the locations are equally east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 4, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison
        question rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it notes a directional difference, stating that Santa
        Cruz County is "south and slightly west" of Santa Clara County. Even though
        the difference might be small ("slightly west"), any stated difference means
        this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer without any qualifications or uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines their relative positions and concludes
        that Loch Lomond is "south and west of Mountain View". Since it identifies
        a directional difference, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is west of the other), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, with a clear directional explanation that Loch Lomond is west of Mountain
        View, not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Loch Lomond is west of Mountain View). The NO is given because
        the premise being tested (is it east?) is false.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Loch Lomond is west of Mountain View (where Saint Joseph
        Parish is located), not east of it. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional reasoning that one location being
        south of another means it cannot be directly east, implying a difference in
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

        in fact, it explicitly noted that locations in Santa Cruz County would be
        "south and slightly west" of locations in Santa Clara County. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a definitive
        NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Loch
        Lomond is west of Mountain View, not because the locations are at equal positions.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (west vs east),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Loch Lomond is west of Mountain View and therefore
        cannot be east of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

        equal positions. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Santa Cruz County (where Loch Lomond is) is "south and slightly
        west" of Santa Clara County (where Saint Joseph Parish is). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "NOT east of" as the comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly describes a directional difference, stating that Oakland
        (Pittsburgh Playhouse) is east of downtown (Benedum Center), making Benedum
        Center west of Pittsburgh Playhouse. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there is a directional difference,
        concluding that "Benedum Center is west of the Pittsburgh Playhouse." The
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, where it determined that

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Calvary Church is slightly
        northeast of South Coast Repertory," indicating a difference in position,
        even if slight. This directional difference, not equality, is the basis for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Miami Beach is south
        of Hobe Sound, and since both are on the east coast, concludes the Raleigh
        Hotel is not east of the Bubble Houses. The NO is based on relative positions
        being different, not equal.

        Beach being "south and slightly west" of Hobe Sound. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight", any stated difference means this is not an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly noted that Miami Beach is "slightly further
        east" than Hobe Sound. Even though it described the difference as not "huge,"
        any stated difference (even if described as slight) means we should classify
        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. While it noted Miami Beach
        is "slightly further east," it still gave a clear NO as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Miami Beach is southeast of Hobe Sound, not strictly east), and
        this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that the locations "remain
        roughly on the same longitude," this is not presented as the primary reason
        for the NO answer. The model's conclusion explicitly states that the NO is
        because "Miami Beach is south of Hobe Sound." Additionally, saying locations
        "remain roughly on the same longitude" is not the same as stating they are
        exactly equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional reasoning
        (Miami Beach being south of Hobe Sound) for why one location is not east of
        the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal in
        longitude. In fact, it notes that Miami Beach is "very slightly more east"
        due to coastline curvature, even though it considers them "essentially on
        the same east-west line." Since any difference is noted, even if described
        as slight, this must be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and states
        "Miami Beach (and thus the Raleigh Hotel) is NOT east of Hobe Sound." This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that El Dorado Lake is "generally southwest
        of" Milford Lake, showing a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. El Dorado Lake is
        not east of Milford Lake" as its comparative conclusion. This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Southern California is "significantly west of eastern Oregon"
        and concludes that none of the Sandals Church locations are east of Owyhee
        Reservoir.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the
        locations.

    4fefff0c-b316-4c0a-86f4-94fd1aab876d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (California being west of Oregon), not because the locations are at the same
        position. It explicitly states there's a directional difference, saying it's
        "highly unlikely for any location of Sandals Church in California to be east
        of the Owyhee Reservoir."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, making a directional determination based on geographical
        reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying
        "Southern California is west of eastern Oregon." The NO is because one location
        is west of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Sandals Church, CA is not east
        of Owyhee Reservoir, OR." This is a clear negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it concluded California is west of
        Oregon, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that California locations would
        be west of Oregon locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that eastern Oregon is "far north and east of Southern California"),
        not because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly indicates
        there is a geographical difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations and their relative positions. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same - instead, it concluded NO based on geographical reasoning
        that California locations would be west of eastern Oregon. The response discusses
        relative positions (west vs east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Sandals
        Church is not east of Owyhee Reservoir.

        (Southern California being "significantly west" of eastern Oregon), not because
        the locations are at equal positions. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reasoning that Sandals
        Church is west (not east) of Owyhee Reservoir.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sandals Church is "significantly
        west" of the comparison point, indicating a clear difference in longitude.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Sandals Church is east of Owyhee Reservoir, after
        determining that Sandals Church is actually west of the reservoir.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on geographical reasoning
        that a location in California cannot be east of a location in Oregon due to
        their relative positions. The answer indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing reasoning about geographical positions to support
        this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional reason for its NO answer, stating
        that California is west of Oregon, therefore implying a difference in location.
        Even though this reasoning appears backwards (since west of would typically
        mean YES), we must take the explicit NO answer at face value while noting
        there was a stated directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, arguing that the church is west (not east) of the lake because
        California is west of Oregon.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Boldt Castle is "to the north
        and west" of Jamesville-DeWitt High School, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a definitive
        NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Boldt Castle is northwest of the high school, not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly notes a directional difference (northwest), so even though
        this might be a small difference, any stated directional difference means
        we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Boldt Castle is northwest of the high school and therefore
        "definitely not east"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted a directional difference, stating "Northern New
        York (Boldt Castle) is generally west of central New York (Jamesville-DeWitt)".
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that All
        Souls is "further west than Foundry," indicating a difference in position
        (not equality). The NO was based on a directional difference, not because
        the locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found a directional difference
        (Harvard St is west of 16th St), not because the locations were equal. The
        model explicitly identified a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that All

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Harvard Street is west of 16th Street
        and concludes that All Souls is west of Foundry. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that All Souls is west of Foundry.

        that All Souls is west of Foundry (on Harvard St NW, which is west of 16th
        St NW), not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "All Souls is
        further west on Harvard St NW than Foundry is on 16th St NW" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it determined that Harvard
        St NW is west of 16th St NW, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO was based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "All Souls is slightly
        further west than Foundry," indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that All
        Souls is west of Foundry (due to street numbering), not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that All Souls is west of Foundry, not east. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 440 Park Avenue is north of 425 Park Avenue.
        The NO answer appears to be given because they are on the same street (Park
        Avenue) and thus neither is east or west of the other, not because the locations
        are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        were equal. Instead, it explained that buildings on the same avenue are north/south
        of each other rather than east/west, which was the basis for its NO answer.
        The model noted different street numbers (425 vs 440) indicating different
        positions.

    27531118-a16b-433a-b999-72c86dae2cad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both buildings are on Park
        Avenue, it does not state that they are equal or the same in position - in
        fact, it explicitly notes they are in different positions (one north of the
        other). The NO answer is based on the logical impossibility of an east/west
        relationship for buildings on the same street, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result, not as an
        inability to determine or rejection of premises.

        425 Park Avenue. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in location,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that since one building is
        north of the other (440 vs 425), their east-west positions are irrelevant.
        This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that the east/west comparison
        doesn't apply because the buildings are on the same avenue but at different
        north/south positions. This is a different type of reasoning than saying the
        positions are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word

        same north-south line," it explicitly states that 425 Park Avenue is "slightly
        south" of where the Drake Hotel was located. Since any difference, even if
        described as "slight," means they're not exactly equal, this is not a case
        of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes that 425 is lower than 440 and uses this difference
        to determine their relative positions. The NO answer is based on directional
        reasoning (south vs east), not equality of values

        difference ("425 Park Avenue is slightly south of where the Drake Hotel was
        located") and this difference is the basis for the NO answer. Even though
        the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means the values
        are not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly stated
        there was a difference in position ("Carson Mansion is slightly east of the
        Eureka Inn") and showed different longitude values (-124.1569 vs -124.1637).
        The NO was not due to equal values but due to a detected difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining that Carson Mansion is slightly east of the
        Eureka Inn. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states that Carson Mansion is "slightly
        southeast of Eureka Inn". The NO answer is based on the reasoning that southeast
        is not strictly east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually determined that the Eureka Inn is east of the Carson Mansion
        based on their street locations. The NO appears to indicate that one location
        is not west of the other (though the reasoning could have been clearer).

        saying "Downtown Los Angeles is generally west of Silver Lake" and concludes
        "the Orpheum Theatre is west of the Silver Lake Reservoir". The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison being evaluated
        (not a refusal or inability to determine).

        and concluding that "the Orpheum Theatre is west of the Silver Lake Reservoir."
        The NO answer appears to contradict its own analysis, but we must evaluate
        only what was explicitly stated about equality, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't establish
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Without more information,
        I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the

        it notes they are at different street locations (41st vs 46th) and mentions
        the Gaiety is "further north." The model's reasoning focuses on their different
        positions rather than any equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Camanche Reservoir is "significantly
        west of" The Dalles, Oregon. This difference in location is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical comparison steps.

    cd263bf9-1187-4837-a1cc-edd2e9ac8e70:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it made a determination based on relative positions,
        concluding that California is generally west of Oregon. Since the NO answer
        was based on directional reasoning rather than equality of positions, this
        does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that their relative positions are
        different, with the Oregon location being north of the California location.
        The model concludes it's "highly unlikely" that the CA location is east of
        the OR location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear directional assessment based
        on the relative locations it analyzed.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it determined through mapping that one location was
        positioned relative to the other, just not in the direction being asked about.
        The NO wasn't based on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that the Guthrie is "slightly to the east"
        of In the Heart of the Beast. The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that the Guthrie Theater is actually slightly
        to the east of In the Heart of the Beast, not the other way around.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the theaters are in
        the same location or equal position. Instead, it explicitly states that Phillips
        West (location of first theater) is "south and slightly west" of the Mill
        District (location of second theater), indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that one location is "west (and south)" of the other, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        noting that one location is "west and south" of the other. This directional
        difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - specifically
        that San Albino is south of Pathfinder Reservoir, not east of it. The model
        identifies a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "New Mexico is considerably east of central
        Wyoming" indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

    74ebe5ae-fd16-4c64-a334-085e640b934c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO after determining that the Basilica
        is WEST of the Reservoir (indicating a difference in position), which contradicts
        its NO answer but still shows it's not claiming equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal longitudes. Instead, it explains that while there may be some
        trivial longitude difference, the primary relationship is north-south, making
        the east-west comparison not meaningful. This indicates there could be small
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one location is east
        of the other. The model provides clear reasoning leading to this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative geographical
        positions (New Mexico being south of Wyoming), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference (one is south of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, and this NO is given as a direct

        the same - instead, it explicitly stated that San Albino is "likely significantly
        west" of Pathfinder Reservoir due to longitude line curvature. The NO answer
        was based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any potential equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears incomplete and does not provide
        a clear YES/NO conclusion or comparison between the locations. The model only
        states facts about both locations being in Baltimore but doesn't make a comparative
        statement or provide a final answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e81ed33c-65a2-4317-a551-29afe1aaedfe:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it notes a directional difference, stating "Appleton,
        WI is generally west of Brookfield/Milwaukee, WI." The NO answer appears to
        be based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference (Appleton is northwest of Brookfield, making Brookfield
        southeast of Appleton). The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. The answer is based on a directional comparison that Brookfield
        is southeast, not directly east, of Appleton.

    a8dcc497-b22b-4113-8cfa-05d3934aeba1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/positions
        - it explicitly states that one location is southeast of the other, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is based on the fact that the relationship
        is southeast rather than strictly east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a comparative directional reasoning, indicating that Elmbrook

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Brookfield is west
        of Appleton, which indicates a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after working through the locations and directions.

        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its analysis, indicating that the Balboa Theatre
        is not east of the San Diego Civic Theatre (in fact stating it's "slightly
        west")
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3686e06f-278c-498b-aa09-5f7c03b14607:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Balboa Theatre is
        slightly West of San Diego Civic Theatre", indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality. Since it identifies a directional difference (even if
        slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions and finding that Balboa Theatre is
        slightly West of San Diego Civic Theatre.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality or
        differences mentioned in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES." after its step-by-step analysis
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    693ce472-a2f7-4f6f-a55e-e1cfc658c604:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Balboa Theatre is
        "slightly west" of San Diego Civic Theatre. Even though the difference is
        described as "slight", any stated difference means the values are not equal.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the relative
        positions (finding that one location is west of the other)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal - the model
        found different longitude values (-117.1586 vs -117.1625)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly stated "Answer: YES" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the locations'

      result: 'YES'
    fd496b66-e0bc-4782-8ad6-66810770f180:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that -117.1570 is greater
        (less negative) than -117.1628, indicating a difference in values and concluding
        that Balboa Theatre is east of the Civic Theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining that the Balboa Theatre is east of the San
        Diego Civic Theatre (not west).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fef110c0-481c-4615-a482-4bc5f7ccd9e5:

      explanation_equal_values: "While the values are close (-117.1628\xB0 vs -117.1578\xB0\
        ), the model explicitly states there is a difference (\"slightly west\") and\
        \ uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The model does not\
        \ claim the values are equal or the same."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Balboa Theatre is slightly west of the San Diego
        Civic Theatre based on comparing their longitude values.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying
        "Western Minnesota is further west than eastern Oklahoma" and "Lac qui Parle,
        MN is west of Tulsa, OK." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Lac qui Parle, MN is west of Tulsa, OK. This is a direct
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    55a761de-5280-4d32-96ef-e8f0fac89340:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly determined that Lac qui Parle, MN is
        west of Tulsa, OK. The NO appears to be a direct contradiction to the reasoning
        provided, but we must evaluate only what was stated, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5dbf009e-54e9-47cd-9208-cf109aa48e63:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal - it actually stated that Lac qui Parle is west of Tulsa, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO appears to be in response to whether one
        location is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Lac qui Parle, MN is west of Tulsa, OK. This is a direct
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes that Lac qui Parle, MN is west
        of Tulsa, OK, noting that Minnesota is "significantly west of even eastern
        Oklahoma." The NO answer appears to be an error given the explanation provided,
        but we must evaluate only what was stated, not correct inconsistencies.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the locations. This appears to
        be a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    822d0c9e-e7b8-4592-9482-a55163bdc08e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Lac qui Parle
        would be west of Tulsa, indicating a difference in location. The model specifically
        notes that "western Minnesota would almost certainly be west of a location
        in eastern Oklahoma."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9399a92b-0673-4d76-bed9-23a4fd7fe9b9:

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Lac qui Parle, MN is west
        of Tulsa, OK, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer appears to
        be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b3c103b5-038b-4cf2-a0ae-b4a55d4a0ce2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Minnesota is west of Oklahoma and
        concludes that Lac qui Parle is west of Tulsa. The NO is because the relationship
        is the opposite of what was asked (west instead of east), not because the
        locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Lac qui Parle, MN is west of Tulsa, OK, not east. This
        is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    cec3a53c-6d92-4767-b427-61aae1d5b1b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Lac qui Parle, MN is west of Tulsa, OK, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO appears to be answering whether the first
        location is east of the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Lac qui Parle,
        MN is west of Tulsa, OK (not east).

    dc6a4268-2d6a-4c6a-8149-c65aa3079fe2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually indicates a difference, stating that "Minnesota
        is generally west of Oklahoma." Since it notes a directional difference (even
        if this might be factually incorrect), this cannot be classified as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ebe9e386-6cd9-4fb3-bb53-0d4a161ca60b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after walking through its reasoning steps.
