    03c2c238-5210-43fc-a7d8-2affb55af755:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Pine Flat Dam is "west or
        southwest" of St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative
        positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on determining that
        the locations are in different positions (California being west of Nevada),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Pine Flat Dam is not east of St.
        Mary's Church (because it determined Pine Flat Dam is west of the church)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    25950ee9-681f-463b-9909-9c7c330bcc73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined Pine
        Flat Dam is west of St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church, not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states that
        one location is west of the other ("Pine Flat Dam is likely west of St. Mary's
        in the Mountains Catholic Church rather than east"), indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Pine Flat Dam being
        west of St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church, not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Pine
        Flat Dam is generally west of St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church")
        and uses this as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Pine Flat Dam is east of St. Mary's in the Mountains
        Catholic Church. The answer is given as a direct comparative result, not as
        an inability to determine.

        is "likely west of Schoharie Reservoir" - indicating a difference in position,
        even if the model is uncertain about the exact locations. The NO answer is
        based on this westward position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it
        determines Lake Surprise is "likely west of Schoharie Reservoir." Since it
        indicates a directional difference (west vs east), even though described as
        "likely," this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Christ Church Cathedral is "likely
        to the west or southwest of Second Presbyterian Church" - this indicates a
        directional difference, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference rather than the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when determining if Christ Church Cathedral is east of Second Presbyterian
        Church. The answer is clearly stated and represents a comparative directional
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal or unequal values in the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the churches are "relatively
        close to each other" and in the "downtown area," it does not explicitly state
        they are at the exact same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it
        concludes NO based on there not being significant east-west positioning differences,
        which still implies some difference exists.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the churches are at
        equal longitudes or exactly the same east-west position. Instead, it suggests
        they are "not significantly east-west of each other" and are "more likely
        to be north-south aligned," but this is not the same as stating they are at
        equal positions. The NO answer appears to be based on the conclusion that
        it's "unlikely" one is east of the other, not because they are at identical
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the churches.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, describing
        Second Presbyterian as being "north or northwest" of Christ Church Cathedral.
        The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Christ Church Cathedral is east of Second Presbyterian Church.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it stated that Christ Church Cathedral
        is "south or southwest" of Second Presbyterian Church - indicating a different
        relative position, not equality. The NO was based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Christ Church Cathedral is east of Second Presbyterian Church.

        the buildings likely have a north-south relationship rather than an east-west
        one due to Newark's street grid layout. This is describing a different spatial
        relationship, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the Cathedral is east of the Baptist Church. This is a clear
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with one church being west of the other.
        The NO answer was given because one church is west of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "the Seventeenth Church of Christ,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Colonial Theatre is "more northward
        or northwestward" relative to Charles Playhouse, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Colonial Theatre is east of Charles Playhouse. The answer
        is clearly stated and provides a comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying Colonial
        Theatre is "to the west or slightly west of Charles Playhouse." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative directional assessment that Colonial
        Theatre is not east of Charles Playhouse.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2, regardless of any comparisons made in the
        response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in bold, concluding that the Colonial Theatre is located east of the Charles
        Playhouse.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both theaters are on the
        "same side" of the river (West Side), it doesn't explicitly state they are
        at the exact same location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
        Rather, it uses their shared western location to conclude that one cannot
        be east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative locations
        of the theaters.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the theaters are in "similar
        east-west positions," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical/the
        same. The phrase "similar positions" implies there could be some difference,
        even if slight. Additionally, this similarity is presented as context rather
        than the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Colonial Theatre is east of Charles Playhouse.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ec922c55-6b09-43d0-85b8-0be22fd91ffa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality or differences in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "UNCLEAR" and explains that
        it cannot determine the relative positions. This is equivalent to saying it
        cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    fd7497e6-1e6a-47ea-9bab-dc7370f52e49:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it specifically indicates a directional difference, stating that
        "the Charles Playhouse being slightly more eastward" and that the Colonial
        Theatre is "either west or southwest of the Charles Playhouse." Even though
        these differences might be small, any stated directional difference means
        this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the theaters.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ff47b91f-1f63-4e43-bbb3-e51ed1ec9139:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the theaters are close to
        each other ("not significantly separated") and in the same district, it does
        not explicitly state they are at exactly the same longitude or that equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. The response suggests the NO is based on
        the Colonial Theatre not being "significantly east" of the Charles Playhouse.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rose Valley Lake is "west
        or southwest of the shrine," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative
        positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it does not
        state that the locations are at equal positions. Instead, it indicates that
        Washington, D.C. is east of Pennsylvania, implying a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on the fact that Rose Valley Lake is west of (not east
        of) the shrine, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it in bold at the end of a structured analysis. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        at the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Rose Valley Lake is west/northwest of the shrine, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison directly.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Rose
        Valley Lake is west of the shrine, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model determined that Rose Valley Lake is west (not east) of

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Rose Valley Lake is west of the shrine), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates there is a difference
        in position, with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Rose Valley Lake being west of the shrine), not on the locations being at
        equal positions. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        even though it uses words like "likely" to express some uncertainty about
        the exact positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it does not state that
        the lakes are at the same longitude or equally east/west of each other. Instead,
        it explains they are both in the western part of Missouri but doesn't claim
        they're at the same position. The model's reasoning is based on their general
        locations relative to Kansas City and the state borders, not on them being
        at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Longview Lake is east of Smithville Lake. This is a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        where it concludes St. Padre Pio Shrine is east of Cranberry Lake. It does
        not state or suggest the locations are at the same longitude or equal position.
        Rather, it indicates a clear directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Cranberry Lake is east of St. Padre Pio Shrine. The
        answer is given definitively without qualifications or uncertainty.

      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" as its final answer.
        While it notes that one location is east of the other, it ultimately says
        NO because it rejects the premise that one location is in Maryland. Since
        this is rejecting the premise of the question, this should be classified as

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Cobb Energy Performing
        Arts Centre is "likely west or northwest" of Christ Church Cathedral, indicating
        a difference in location. The NO is based on the fact that one location is
        west of the other, not because they are at the same location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its determination
        that Atlanta (and thus Cobb Energy Centre) is west of Lexington (and thus
        Christ Church Cathedral). The model does not state or suggest the locations
        are at the same longitude or equal position - it explicitly states one is
        west of the other. Therefore, the NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre is east of Christ
        Church Cathedral. The model provides a directional analysis and concludes
        with a definitive NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying
        the Theater District (and thus John Golden Theatre) is west of the Flatiron
        District (and One Madison). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the John Golden Theatre is east of One Madison, providing
        a direct comparative result.

    de25b904-4257-4213-8a61-ab4b92eb2c22:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (John Golden Theatre being west of One Madison), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that the John Golden Theatre is west
        of One Madison, not east of it.

    eea9beb2-dcfa-45b1-a8cb-3cb7ad67192a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it determines NO because John Golden Theatre is "west or northwest
        of One Madison" - indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether John Golden Theatre is located east of One Madison is: NO" - this
        is a clear NO comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Lake Monroe is "south or southeast"
        of Griffy Lake, which describes a different relative position rather than
        equality. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether Lake Monroe is east of Griffy Lake. The answer is clearly
        stated and is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lakes are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Lake
        Monroe is "south and east" of Griffy Lake, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because Lake Monroe is southeast rather than directly
        east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the lakes. The model indicates Lake Monroe is southeast of Griffy Lake,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same location or equal position. Instead, it explicitly states there is a
        directional difference - that Lake Monroe is west of Griffy Lake. Even though
        there may be issues with the logic used (about south being generally west),
        the model clearly indicates a directional difference rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the lakes.
        The model states Lake Monroe is west of Griffy Lake, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same longitude/position. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Lake Monroe is "more to the south and slightly west of
        Griffy Lake." Since it indicates a directional difference (even if slight),
        this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative directional statement that Lake Monroe
        is not east of Griffy Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Ziegfeld Theatre
        is "likely west of New York City Center" and bases this on differences in
        street numbers. The model identifies a directional difference between the
        locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        the Ziegfeld Theatre is west (not east) of New York City Center, not because
        the locations are equal. It explicitly states "the Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)
        is located west of New York City Center rather than east." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that St. James Cathedral is "positioned
        slightly west" of the Orange County Courthouse. This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality. Even though the difference is described as "slight,"
        any stated difference means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it describes them as being "in close proximity"
        and "not far apart," but doesn't explicitly state they're at the same location
        or have equal coordinates. The NO answer appears to be based on the model's
        assessment of the general layout rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether equal values were cited
        as a reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDETERMINED"
        and indicates it cannot make a definitive determination about the relative

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that First African Baptist Church is not located east of Lake
        Mohawk. The answer is clearly stated and presented as a comparative result.

        give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were the reason
        for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "LIKELY YES" and explicitly
        notes that "the answer is not definitive." This indicates uncertainty and
        lacks a clear YES/NO answer, making it an UNKNOWN response. While it leans
        towards yes, it deliberately avoids making a definitive comparative statement.

        and provides directional difference (Basilica is to the east of HERE Arts
        Center). The NO answer is given because the premise was incorrect about the
        direction, not because the locations are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Manhattan is west of Brooklyn and therefore one location
        is west of the other. The NO is given because the model believes the relationship
        is the opposite of what was asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Basilica of Regina Pacis is west of HERE Arts Center), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is west/southwest
        of the other. The NO answer is given because the model determines Basilica
        of Regina Pacis is west rather than east of HERE Arts Center.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (southeast vs east). The NO is based on the fact that the Basilica
        is southeast rather than purely east of HERE Arts Center.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on its geographic analysis
        that the Basilica is southeast rather than directly east of HERE Arts Center.

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model indicates there is a directional
        difference, suggesting the cathedral is likely to the east of Lake Crabtree.
        The NO appears to be based on the specific directional relationship being

        stating that Morrisville (where Lake Crabtree is) is to the west of Raleigh
        (where the cathedral is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or equally east/west of each other. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for its NO answer - that the cathedral is south of Lake Crabtree. While
        this reasoning may be flawed (since north/south position doesn't determine
        east/west position), the model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equally east/west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the cathedral is east of Lake Crabtree. While the model's reasoning
        focuses on north/south positioning rather than east/west, it still provides
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating McCallum Theatre is "likely west or northwest of Morena Dam"), not
        because the locations are at the same coordinates. The model indicates a difference
        in position, even if its geographical reasoning may be incorrect.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, noting that Presidential Towers is "generally
        west of Steppenwolf Theatre Company" in its reasoning.

        as being "west or southwest of Steppenwolf Theatre Company." Since a directional
        difference was explicitly stated, even if the model was uncertain of the exact
        positions, this indicates the values were not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        both are west of the Chicago River but does not indicate they are at the same
        east-west position. The NO answer is based on Presidential Towers not being
        east of Steppenwolf, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that the locations are at the same position or equal longitude. Instead, it
        describes different relative positions (West Loop vs Lincoln Park) and uses
        these different positions to reach its conclusion. The NO is based on relative

        never claimed the locations were at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "likely NO" but explicitly
        states it lacks specific location information to make a definitive determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pat Mayse Lake is west of
        Oologah Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that "Oologah Lake is slightly more eastward
        than Pat Mayse Lake." This difference, even though described as slight, means
        the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Oologah Lake is slightly more eastward
        than Pat Mayse Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at equal
        longitude. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, noting that
        "Pat Mayse Lake being slightly west of Oologah Lake." Even though this difference
        is described as "slight," any stated difference means this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Pat Mayse Lake is east of Oologah Lake. The answer is clearly
        stated and provides a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Pat Mayse Lake
        is west of Oologah Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether Pat Mayse Lake is east of Oologah Lake. The answer is clearly

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical in longitude. Instead, it explained
        that they have "a more north-south alignment rather than a clear east-west
        one" as the reason for the NO answer. This indicates a different spatial relationship
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Pat Mayse Lake is east of Oologah Lake. This is a clear
        comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or that they are at the same east-west position. Instead,
        it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that Triumph Church is likely
        north of Rosary Cathedral rather than east. Since equality is not mentioned
        as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether Triumph Church is east of Rosary Cathedral. The answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Sandals Church is "west of"
        Owyhee Reservoir. The NO answer is given because one location is west of the
        other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in bold, making a direct comparative judgment about the geographic
        relationship between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, explaining that California is west of Oregon and that Riverside
        is "relatively more south than east" compared to Owyhee Reservoir.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Sandals Church is west of Owyhee Reservoir, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer is bolded and comes after a clear step-by-step analysis
        concluding that Sandals Church is west of (not east of) Owyhee Reservoir.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, indicating that Sandals Church would be "south or southwest"
        of Owyhee Reservoir. Since it indicates a directional difference, even if
        related to north-south rather than east-west positioning, this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Sandals Church is east of Owyhee Reservoir. This is a clear
        comparative result.

        The model explicitly states it believes "Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel
        is west of All Saints Church rather than east." There is no mention of the
        locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        west of Boone Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO is given because
        the question asked if one was east of the other, and the model determined
        there was a difference in the opposite direction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two lakes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Beech Fork Lake
        is west of Boone Lake, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model specifically states "Beech Fork Lake is likely west of Boone Lake
        rather than east."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Beech Fork Lake is east of Boone Lake. The answer was clearly
        stated and presented as a comparative result.

        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it concluded NO because
        it determined The Anthem was "likely west of AFI Silver." The model described
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether The Anthem is located east of AFI Silver. This was a clear
        comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        the same coordinates or equal in any way - rather it explicitly notes a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Peery's Egyptian Theater is east of Montana State
        Capitol. The answer is given definitively based on geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Ogden, Utah is west of Helena, Montana, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        one location is "west of" the other, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because the relationship was opposite to what was
        asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes that Peery's Egyptian
        Theater is "NOT located east of Montana State Capitol" and explicitly states
        it is west instead. This is a clear NO answer to whether one location is east
        of the other.

        east-west positioning "is not a factor" and "is not relevant." This is different
        from stating they are at the same east-west position. The model's NO appears

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it specifically indicates that Eureka Inn is "west
        or southwest of Carson Mansion," indicating a directional difference between
        their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west of each other. Instead, it gives a
        different reason for the NO answer - that Carson Mansion is "more likely to
        be north or south of Eureka Inn rather than east or west" based on the street
        layout. Since the NO is not due to equal positions, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates that the Orpheum Theatre is south or southeast
        of the reservoir, which is a different directional relationship. The NO answer
        is given because of this different directional relationship, not because the
        locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the Orpheum Theatre is east of Silver Lake Reservoir. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its analysis that
        the Orpheum Theatre is "south or southwest of Silver Lake Reservoir rather
        than east." This indicates a directional difference between the locations,
        not equality. The model never states that the locations are at the same coordinates
        or equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it's
        not because the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model indicates
        there is a directional difference (the Orpheum Theatre is south of the reservoir,
        not east). The NO answer is based on a different relative position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on geographic positioning. The
        model concludes that the Orpheum Theatre is south of, not east of, the Silver
        Lake Reservoir.

        (stating the Orpheum Theatre is west of Silver Lake Reservoir), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly describes a difference
        in position, with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - the Orpheum Theatre is southwest of the
        Silver Lake Reservoir. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographic relationship
        between the two locations. The model states the Orpheum Theatre is southwest
        of the Silver Lake Reservoir, not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes different positions (Orpheum
        as "centrally located" and Silver Lake as "northeastern"), and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    1c36c72e-858d-4eb0-9cf1-27ba51c54bf4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Comedy Theatre was actually west of the Gaiety Theatre, not because the locations
        were equal. The model explicitly states "the Comedy Theatre on West 43rd Street
        would be to the west of the Gaiety Theatre on Broadway" and concludes it was
        "not located east." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative locations
        of the theaters.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison
        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it's "challenging to provide
        a clear YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks precise information to make
        the comparison. The response avoids making a definitive comparative statement
        and instead emphasizes the need for more historical research.

        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it suggests they are "clustered
        together" but provides a directional conclusion that one is not east of the
        other. The NO answer is based on the layout of the Theater District and Manhattan's
        orientation, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the Comedy Theatre is east of the Gaiety Theatre. While
        the reasoning includes uncertainty ("likely that"), the final answer is clearly
        stated.

        likely to be aligned along the same avenue, with some variation in their north-south
        positions rather than east-west." This indicates a different reasoning for
        the NO answer, not equality of position.

        the same location or had equal coordinates. Instead, it explains that they
        were on different streets (41st vs 42nd) and states the NO answer is because
        one was south of the other, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying the
        Comedy Theatre is "slightly west" of the Gaiety Theatre. This difference,
        even though described as "slight," means the NO answer is not due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same - rather, it explains that both theaters are
        on the west side of the river, but doesn't state they're at the exact same
        location. The NO is based on their relative positions being different (not
        east of each other) rather than being identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (west/southwest vs east), not on the locations being equal. It
        explicitly states that one theater is "west or southwest of the Guthrie Theater
        rather than east," indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison indicating that In the Heart

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Elmbrook Church is "west
        or southwest" of the 222 Building, describing a directional difference between
        the locations as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the buildings are likely
        in "close proximity" and "the same general vicinity," it does not explicitly
        state they are at exactly/approximately the same location. Instead, it indicates
        they are "not significantly east of each other" but still potentially different
        positions. The NO answer is based on lack of significant difference rather
        than exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the buildings having
        different positions (north-south alignment rather than east-west). It does
        not state that the buildings are at the same longitude or equally east/west
        of each other. Rather, it explains they have different positions, with one
        being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed the
        buildings were at the same location - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Flatiron Building is west of the Blackstone Hotel, not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states "the Flatiron Building is on the western
        side of downtown Fort Worth, and the Blackstone Hotel is on the eastern side"
        indicating a difference in position.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        states that "the Flatiron Building is located to the west of the Blackstone
        Hotel" - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it in bold at the end of a step-by-step analysis.
        The answer is given as a direct comparative result, stating that the Flatiron

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality or differences in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNCERTAIN"
        and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions without more specific
        details. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicated that the Flatiron Building
        is "likely west of the Blackstone Hotel rather than east." This directional
        difference, even if described as "likely," indicates the NO answer was based
        on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the Flatiron Building is east of the Blackstone Hotel. The

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Alabama is "more westward compared to Indiana" and bases its NO answer
        on this directional difference. Any stated difference, even if described as
        slight, means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that the Cathedral
        is west of the Forrest Theatre, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the Cathedral is east of the Forrest Theatre. This is a
        clear comparative directional statement.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the model states the Cathedral
        is west of the Forrest Theatre (opposite direction from what was asked), indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the Cathedral is east of the Forrest Theatre. This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Glenwood Generating
        Station was "west or southwest of Most Holy Trinity Church." Since it indicated
        a directional difference (even if based on general geography), this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Glenwood Generating Station is east of Most Holy Trinity
        Church. The answer was clearly stated and presented as a comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its determination
        that Balboa Theatre is "west or southwest" of San Diego Civic Theatre, not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states
        a directional difference between the locations, making this a comparison of
        different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Balboa Theatre is east of San Diego Civic Theatre. The answer
        is clearly stated and represents a comparative directional result.

    ee033578-ea89-4799-9fb8-a02d8b05bbe3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it specifically indicated that Balboa Theatre is "west or southwest
        of San Diego Civic Theatre" and described different relative positions (Balboa
        being "closer to the bay" while Civic Theatre is "more centrally located").
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Balboa Theatre is located east of San Diego Civic Theatre.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it gives a NO answer
        because it determines Lac qui Parle is "north or northeast" rather than east
        of the church. Since it indicates a directional difference (even if including
        "northeast"), this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Lac qui Parle, MN is located east of First Presbyterian
        Church (Tulsa), OK. This is a clear comparative result.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lac qui Parle is west/northwest
        of First Presbyterian Church (Tulsa). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lac qui Parle is east of First Presbyterian Church
        (Tulsa). The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lac qui Parle
        is west of Tulsa ("In fact, it's west of Tulsa"). The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it in bold at the end of its analysis. The answer
        is given as a direct comparative result, not as an inability to determine.

        that Lac qui Parle is "likely west or northwest of Tulsa" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The model never states or suggests the locations
        are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Lac qui Parle
        is not east of First Presbyterian Church in Tulsa.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    362e3b38-25ac-457f-a9ce-8d9e6ad3b479:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Oklahoma is west of Minnesota and
        concludes that Lac qui Parle cannot be east of the church in Tulsa. The NO
        answer is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it in bold at the end
        of a structured analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its determination
        that Lac qui Parle is west of First Presbyterian Church, not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Lac
        qui Parle is likely west of Tulsa") and uses this as the basis for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Lac qui Parle is east of First Presbyterian Church. The
        answer is clearly stated and represents a comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lac qui Parle
        is west of Tulsa, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or verify. The
        answer is presented as a definitive comparative result based on geographical
        analysis.
