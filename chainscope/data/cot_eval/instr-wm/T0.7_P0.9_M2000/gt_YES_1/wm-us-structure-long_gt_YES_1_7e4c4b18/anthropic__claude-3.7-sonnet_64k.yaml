      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions, not on the values being equal. The model explains
        that Pine Flat Dam is west of St. Mary's Church because California is west
        of Nevada, and the dam is in California while the church is in Nevada. The
        model does not state that the locations have the same longitude or are at
        equal positions.

        equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the Cathedral
        Basilica is west of New Hope Baptist Church, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model concludes "The Cathedral Basilica of
        the Sacred Heart is not located east of New Hope Baptist Church. Rather, it
        is located west of it."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - specifically
        that St. James Cathedral is east of the Seventeenth Church (not that they
        are at the same longitude). The model used Chicago's address system to determine
        that St. James (65 E. Huron) is further east than the Seventeenth Church (55
        E. Wacker).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model determined that the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist is NOT

        gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer, explaining
        that the Cathedral is east of the Civic Center, which means the Civic Center
        is west of the Cathedral.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        and "the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer (Manhattan) is west of the Co-Cathedral

        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that 425 Park
        Avenue is on the west side of Park Avenue while the Drake Hotel was on the
        east side. The model concludes that "425 Park Avenue is located west of the
        Drake Hotel, not east of it." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
        of whether 425 Park Avenue is located east of Drake Hotel with a definitive
        "NO" after analyzing the locations of both buildings.

        The reason for the NO answer is that Carson Mansion is west of Eureka Inn,
        not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly saying "Carson Mansion is not located east of Eureka Inn. It is
