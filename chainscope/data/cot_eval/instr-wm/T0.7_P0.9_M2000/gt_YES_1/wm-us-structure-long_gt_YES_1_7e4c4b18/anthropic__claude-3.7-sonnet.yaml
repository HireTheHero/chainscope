      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dam is west of the church,
        indicating a directional difference. The model's reasoning is that Pine Flat
        Dam is in California which is west of Nevada where the church is located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Pine Flat Dam, CA is
        not located east of St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church, NV." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded that
        Pine Flat Dam is west of the church, not east of it. The model identified
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Pine Flat Dam is west
        of St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church, not east of it, and provided
        this as a direct answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Rampart Reservoir is west of the Cathedral, not east of it. The model
        explicitly states "the Rampart Reservoir must be west of the Cathedral" and
        "The Reservoir is west of the Cathedral." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Rampart Reservoir is east of the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate
        Conception. The model explicitly concludes "Rampart Reservoir is NOT east
        of the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception. The Reservoir is west

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Kewaunee Power Station is
        located slightly northeast of it [Point Beach Nuclear Plant]", indicating
        a directional difference. The model is saying NO because the direction is
        northeast rather than directly east, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Kewaunee Power Station
        is not located east of Point Beach Nuclear Plant." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparison question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "It is actually slightly south
        and west of Point Beach," indicating a difference in position. The model is
        giving a NO answer because it believes Kewaunee is west (not east) of Point
        Beach.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Kewaunee Power Station

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference in position,
        noting that "Kewaunee would be slightly east of Point Beach" due to the curved
        shoreline of Lake Michigan. The model's NO answer is based on this positional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model provides a step-by-step analysis of
        the locations of the two nuclear power plants and concludes with a definitive
        "NO" answer.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Kewaunee Power Station is actually located
        slightly west and south of Point Beach." The model is noting a difference
        in position (slightly west), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Kewaunee Power Station
        is not located east of Point Beach Nuclear Plant." This is a clear negative

        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES - Kewaunee Power Station is located east
        of Point Beach Nuclear Plant" as its final answer.

    c2848295-2ba8-4fa0-9ea4-cdd828c507e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it states that "Kewaunee Power Station is slightly east
        of Point Beach Nuclear Plant due to the curvature of the shoreline" but then
        concludes it is "slightly northeast, not directly east." Since the model notes
        a directional difference (northeast vs. east), this is not a case where the
        values are considered equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Kewaunee Power Station

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that "Kewaunee is south of Point Beach, and possibly
        slightly east due to the shoreline curvature, but Point Beach is not east
        of Kewaunee." The model is noting a directional difference (south vs. north)
        and even mentions a possible slight east position for Kewaunee, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Kewaunee Power Station
        is not located east of Point Beach Nuclear Plant." This is a clear negative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Kewaunee "would be slightly southeast of
        Point Beach, not directly east." This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality. The model is saying NO because the directional relationship
        is different than what was asked (southeast rather than east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Kewaunee Power Station
        is not located east of Point Beach Nuclear Plant." This is a clear negative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states "They are approximately at the same
        longitude" which suggests equality, but then adds "with Kewaunee being slightly
        to the north, but not meaningfully east of Point Beach." The phrase "not meaningfully
        east" implies there might be some tiny eastward difference but it's considered
        negligible. In step 3, the model also mentions "Kewaunee being slightly northeast
        of Point Beach" and in step 4 "Kewaunee Power Station is marginally east of
        Point Beach." These statements indicate a slight difference rather than exact
        equality, even if the difference is described as minimal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Kewaunee Power Station
        is not located east of Point Beach Nuclear Plant." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        north and slightly east of Point Beach." The model is saying NO because the
        direction is northeast rather than purely east, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Kewaunee Power Station is east of Point Beach Nuclear Plant. The
        model provides a clear negative comparative result.

        Bull Shoals Dam is slightly east of Lake of the Ozarks\" based on this difference.\
        \ Since the model identifies a difference rather than equality, this is False."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different directional relationship,
        stating that Bull Shoals Dam "is actually located to the south and slightly
        west of Lake of the Ozarks." This indicates a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, and
        then elaborates that "Bull Shoals Dam, AR is not located east of Lake of the
        Ozarks, MO." This is a clear negative comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference,
        stating that Bull Shoals Dam is "to the south and slightly west of Lake of
        the Ozarks" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates a difference in
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer. While there is some contradiction in the explanation (first saying
        Bull Shoals Dam is "positioned to the east" then later saying it's "to the
        south and slightly west"), the model clearly gives NO as its final answer
        to the comparison question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bull Shoals Dam
        is slightly east of Lake of the Ozarks," indicating a directional difference
        (east rather than west). This difference in position is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Bull Shoals Dam, AR is not west
        of Lake of the Ozarks, MO. The model actually concludes that "Bull Shoals

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference,
        stating that Bull Shoals Dam "is actually southwest of Lake of the Ozarks."
        Since the model indicates a directional difference rather than equality as
        the reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Bull Shoals Dam in

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explains that Christ Church is "slightly
        east of Meridian Street" while Second Presbyterian is "significantly north
        of downtown on Meridian Street." The model is not saying NO because the locations
        are the same, but rather because of their relative positions (with Second
        Presbyterian being north rather than west of Christ Church).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Christ Church Cathedral
        is not east of Second Presbyterian Church" as its final answer. This is a
        clear negative comparative statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states differences in their
        locations, noting that "Christ Church Cathedral is slightly east of Meridian"
        while "Second Presbyterian is on Meridian Street itself." The model concludes
        with NO, but does not claim equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that it believes Christ Church Cathedral
        is not east of Second Presbyterian Church, contradicting its own reasoning
        in step 7.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal. In its revised analysis, it states that "both churches
        are aligned very close to the same north-south line" and "Christ Church Cathedral
        is not meaningfully east of Second Presbyterian Church." This suggests there
        might be a slight difference (with Christ Church Cathedral "possibly slightly
        east of Meridian"), but the difference is not significant enough to warrant
        a YES answer. Since the model notes a possible slight difference rather than
        stating they are exactly the same, this does not qualify as equal values being
        the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model first gives a "NO" answer, then reconsiders and
        provides a revised analysis, but still concludes with "NO" as its final determination.

        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it explains they are "roughly aligned
        on the same north-south axis" and "neither is significantly east or west of
        the other." The model is indicating they are approximately aligned but not
        stating they are at exactly the same longitude. The reasoning suggests approximate
        alignment rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Christ Church Cathedral

        aligned on the same north-south axis (Meridian Street)" and "neither is significantly
        east or west of the other." While this suggests similarity in position, the
        model is describing an approximate alignment rather than stating they are
        exactly the same, and it's focusing on their relative positions on the north-south
        axis rather than claiming equality as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Christ Church Cathedral

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Christ Church Cathedral is
        "southeast of Second Presbyterian Church" and provides directional differences,
        noting that "Second Presbyterian is significantly north of downtown and on
        Meridian Street, while Christ Church Cathedral is in downtown slightly east
        of Meridian." The model is noting directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Christ Church Cathedral

        is slightly east of Meridian Street, Second Presbyterian Church is... at approximately
        the same east-west position (on Meridian Street)." The model indicates they
        are at "approximately" the same position but not exactly equal, and explains
        that the downtown location would be south of the northern location, "but not
        meaningfully east of it." This suggests a slight difference rather than exact
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that "Christ Church

        Christ Church Cathedral. The model is indicating they have similar east-west
        positioning but different north-south positioning, not that they are at exactly
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Christ Church Cathedral

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Christ Church Cathedral is
        not east of Second Presbyterian Church because it is south of it. The model
        identifies a directional difference (south vs. north) rather than stating
        the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Christ Church Cathedral

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Bel Air Church is in Los Angeles, CA, which
        is west of Lower Monumental Dam in Washington." The model is indicating a
        difference in location (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bel Air Church in
        California is not located east of Lower Monumental Dam in Washington." This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "the Civic Center
        is located slightly to the east of the Cathedral's position," indicating a
        difference in their east-west positioning. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model determined that the Civic Center is located slightly to the east of
        the Cathedral's position, not to the west.

        However, it recognized this contradiction and explicitly corrected itself
        in the final statement to "YES, the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines is

        different locations for the two landmarks and concluded that "the Civic Center
        is located east of St. Ambrose Cathedral." The NO answer was not based on
        equality of values. The model actually described a specific directional relationship
        (east of) between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This directly answers the question of whether
        the Civic Center is located east of St. Ambrose Cathedral. However, this appears
        to contradict the model's own reasoning, as it concluded in the previous sentence
        that "the Civic Center is located east of St. Ambrose Cathedral." Despite
        this contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided.

        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east
        vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines is west
        of St. Ambrose Cathedral. The model concludes that "the Civic Center of Greater
        Des Moines is located east of St. Ambrose Cathedral" and then gives a definitive

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that the Civic Center is located
        to the west of St. Ambrose Cathedral, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model does not claim the locations are equal
        or identical.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer. However, it then explains that the premise of the question
        is incorrect (the George Bush Center is in Virginia, not Maryland). The model
        is rejecting the premise of the question while still providing information
        about the relative positioning. This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference,
        stating that the George Bush Center for Intelligence is "northeast of Lake
        Accotink" rather than directly east. This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the George Bush Center
        for Intelligence is not located east of Lake Accotink." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        The model is clearly indicating a difference in location (west and north vs.
        east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model provides a clear comparative result,
        determining that the George Bush Center for Intelligence is not east of Lake
        Accotink, but rather "west and north of Lake Accotink."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating that "while the CIA Headquarters
        is northeast of Lake Accotink, it's not directly east - it's more to the north."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it does point out an error in the premise (that the George Bush Center
        is in Virginia, not Maryland), it still provides a clear comparative answer
        about the east-west relationship, stating that the Center is northeast of
        Lake Accotink, not directly east.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "The CIA Headquarters
        is northeast of Lake Accotink" and "the George Bush Center for Intelligence
        is located east (specifically northeast) of Lake Accotink." The NO answer
        is based on the incorrect premise in the question (about Maryland), not because
        the locations are in the same place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" because it explicitly
        states "NO - The question contains an incorrect premise." Although the model
        points out an incorrect premise (that the George Bush Center is in Maryland
        rather than Virginia), it still makes a clear comparative judgment about the
        locations, stating that the Center is east (specifically northeast) of Lake
        Accotink. Since the model provides a clear NO as its comparative result, the
        answer is NO.

        east of it." The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs east),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the George Bush Center
        for Intelligence is not located east of Lake Accotink, VA" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "the CIA headquarters
        is east of Lake Accotink," indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The "NO" answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer. Although it notes an error in the premise, it still provides
        a clear comparative judgment about the locations, stating "the CIA Headquarters
        is indeed east of Lake Accotink." The model is making a definitive comparative
        statement with a clear "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final paragraph. However, it then contradicts this by saying "the Center
        is indeed east of Lake Accotink." This contradiction makes the final answer
        unclear, as the model seems to be saying NO to the premise (location in Maryland)
        but YES to the actual comparison (east-west relationship). Since there is
        no clear YES/NO answer to the comparative question, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it first says NO because it believes
        one location is east of the other, and then says NO because it believes the
        premise of the question contains an error about the location. Neither reason
        involves the locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "NO" after determining that
        the George Bush Center for Intelligence is east of Lake Accotink. Then it
        reconsiders and gives another "NO" answer, but for a different reason - because
        it believes the question contains an error about the location being in MD.
        The model clearly states "NO" twice as its final answer.

        The model is indicating a directional difference between the two locations,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference,
        saying that "Horchow Hall at Yale would be west (and slightly north) of Long
        Wharf Theatre, not east of it." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Horchow Hall at Yale

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that Horchow Hall is
        "north and slightly west of Long Wharf Theatre" and "NOT east of Long Wharf
        Theatre, but rather northwest of it." The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Horchow Hall is east of Long Wharf Theatre. The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Horchow Hall is
        west of Long Wharf Theatre, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Horchow Hall is not
        located east of Long Wharf Theatre. It is located west of Long Wharf Theatre."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    75c0c536-6b02-4abc-abc6-aa0fccb67793:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference, stating
        "Rather, Horchow Hall is west of Long Wharf Theatre." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Horchow Hall is not
        east of Long Wharf Theatre." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Horchow Hall is west of Long Wharf Theatre, not east. The model explicitly
        states "Horchow Hall would be west of Long Wharf Theatre, not east" as the
        reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Horchow Hall is west
        of Long Wharf Theatre, not east (which was likely the premise of the original
        question asking if Horchow Hall is east of Long Wharf Theatre).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Horchow Hall is west of Long Wharf Theatre, not east of it. The model
        describes Long Wharf as "along the harbor on the eastern side of New Haven"
        while Yale's campus (including Horchow Hall) is "more central/western." This
        indicates a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Horchow Hall is east of Long Wharf
        Theatre. The model concludes that "Horchow Hall would be west of Long Wharf
        Theatre, not east of it."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Horchow Hall is
        "west/northwest" of Long Wharf Theatre, indicating a directional difference.
        The model gives a clear reason for its NO answer - that Horchow Hall is in
        the opposite direction (west/northwest) from Long Wharf Theatre rather than
        east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Horchow Hall is east of Long Wharf Theatre. The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded that Lake Beshear is actually
        west of Chicago's longitude, not that they are at the same longitude. The
        model specifically states "Lake Beshear is in western Kentucky and is actually
        west of Chicago's longitude."
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially made an error in its reasoning,
        but then corrected itself and explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Lake Beshear is NOT east of St. Nicholas Cathedral in Chicago.

        This indicates a potential slight difference in position (slightly to the
        east) or a partial overlap with just the eastern edge, not complete equality.
        Since the model notes a potential difference in position, this does not qualify
        as stating the values are exactly equal.

        Instead, it explains that both buildings are on the same avenue (Orange Ave)
        and are "roughly aligned on the same north-south axis," but it specifically
        notes that "the Courthouse is further north." The model indicates they are
        on the same avenue but doesn't claim they have identical east-west positions
        - it mentions any east-west difference would be "negligible" but not non-existent.

        equal in their east-west positioning. Instead, it explains that they are "roughly
        aligned on the same north-south axis" and "on the same street" with "neither
        would be significantly east or west of the other." It acknowledges there might
        be "minor east-west variation" due to building footprints. Since it notes
        potential differences rather than stating they are exactly equal, this doesn't
        qualify as claiming the values are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the buildings are on the
        same street but at different positions (215 vs 425 N Orange Ave), with the
        courthouse being further north. The model states they are "roughly aligned
        on the east-west axis" but this indicates a similarity in alignment rather
        than exact equality, and the primary reason for the NO answer appears to be
        that they have a north-south relationship rather than an east-west one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (east-west
        positions) are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says "their east-west
        positioning would be approximately the same" and that there is no "significant
        east-west displacement relative to each other." The use of "approximately"
        and lack of a definitive statement about equality suggests the model is not
        basing its NO answer on the buildings having exactly the same east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether St. James Cathedral is east of the Orange County Courthouse.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that both
        buildings are on the same avenue (Orange Avenue) and "share approximately
        the same east-west position." It further states "Neither building is significantly
        east or west of the other." This indicates the model is saying NO because
        the buildings have essentially equal east-west positions, not because one
        is east/west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        and "not significantly offset east-west from each other." The model is indicating
        they are aligned on the same avenue but with different positions (one south
        of the other), not that they have equal east-west positions.

        the courthouse. The model is indicating they have roughly the same east-west
        positioning but are different in their north-south positioning. This is not
        claiming exact equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        the buildings have different positions (one is south of the other) rather
        than saying they have equal east-west positions. The reason for the NO is
        that they are aligned north-south, not that they are at the exact same east-west
        position.

        aligned on the same north-south avenue" and notes that "Any minor east-west
        variation between buildings on the same street would be minimal." This suggests
        possible minor differences rather than exact equality. The model's reasoning
        is based on their alignment on the same avenue, not on them having identical
        east-west positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Presidential Towers is WEST of Steppenwolf Theatre Company, not east.
        The model identified a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Presidential Towers is east of Steppenwolf Theatre
        Company. The model explicitly concludes "Therefore, Presidential Towers is
        located WEST of Steppenwolf Theatre Company, not east. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Presidential Towers
        is west of Steppenwolf Theatre, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model says "Presidential Towers is further west than
        Steppenwolf Theatre" which clearly indicates a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Presidential Towers
        is NOT east of Steppenwolf Theatre Company; it is west of it." This is an
        explicit NO answer to what appears to be a question about whether Presidential
        Towers is east of Steppenwolf Theatre.

        difference. The model concludes that "Presidential Towers would be southwest
        of Steppenwolf Theatre Company, meaning Presidential Towers is west of Steppenwolf,
        not east." This shows the NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

        between the two locations. The model states "Since California is west of Oregon,
        and the church is in western California, the church must be west of Fourmile
        Lake in Oregon."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Our Lady of the Wayside Church in California is

        Washington and that no part of California (where Anderson Lake is) extends
        eastward beyond Washington's eastern border. The model is indicating a geographical
        relationship where one cannot be east of the other, not that they have equal
        longitude values.

        longitudes or Anderson Lake is further west" which indicates potential differences
        in their positions. The model presents two possibilities - similar longitudes
        or Anderson Lake being further west - rather than stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Anderson Lake (California)

        Church is located at the corner of 16th Street and Harvard Street, which places
        it west of or at the same longitude as 16th Street." The model is not basing
        its NO answer on equality of values but rather on a directional difference
        (suggesting All Souls is west of or at the same longitude, not east).

        or approximate equality, but not exact equality as the primary reason for
        the NO answer. The model is suggesting All Souls might be slightly west of
        Foundry, which would be a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        might be slightly west of Foundry." This indicates a potential difference
        in position (with All Souls possibly being west of Foundry), not an equality
        of positions. The model is suggesting either approximate equality OR a slight
        westward difference, which doesn't meet the criteria for a "True" classification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "they are
        roughly on the same north-south line" and "All Souls is not east of Foundry
        - they are approximately on the same longitude or All Souls might be slightly
        west." The model indicates there might be a slight difference (with All Souls
        possibly being slightly west), which means it's not claiming exact equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 425 Park Avenue is on the
        west side of Park Avenue while the Drake Hotel was on the east side, indicating
        they have different positions. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 425 Park Avenue is not east of where the Drake Hotel
        was located. The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 425 Park Avenue is
        not located east of the Drake Hotel. It is located west of where the Drake
        Hotel stood." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explains that both buildings
        are on the same avenue and have "essentially the same east-west positioning,"
        but it doesn't claim they are exactly at the same east-west coordinate. The
        model acknowledges there could be "minimal difference" if they're on opposite
        sides of the avenue.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 425 Park Avenue
        is not east of the Drake Hotel" as its final answer to the comparative question.

        "425 Park Avenue on the east side of the avenue and the Drake Hotel on the
        west side of the avenue, making 425 Park Avenue west of the Drake Hotel."
        The model is claiming they have different positions, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. 425 Park Avenue is
        not east of the Drake Hotel." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it concludes that 425 Park Avenue is on the
        west side of Park Avenue while the Drake Hotel (440 Park Avenue) is on the
        east side. The model is stating they are in different locations (west vs east),
        not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO - 425 Park
        Avenue is not east of the Drake Hotel's location." The model went through
        several revisions of its reasoning, but ultimately concluded with a definitive
        NO.

        west side of the same street. The model concludes that "425 Park Avenue is
        east of where the Drake Hotel was located," indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the locations of the two buildings. This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model recognized
        its error in reasoning and provided a clear final answer of "YES" to indicate
        that 425 Park Avenue is located east of the Drake Hotel.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that the buildings are on the same
        north-south avenue (Park Avenue), and this equality in position is the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The model states "They are on the same north-south
        avenue, so one cannot be east of the other." This indicates the model is saying
        NO because the locations share the same east-west position, making them equal
        in terms of eastward positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 425 Park Avenue is
        not located east of the Drake Hotel" as its final answer. This is a clear

        The model explains that "Carson Mansion is on M Street near the waterfront,
        and Eureka Inn is on 7th Street further inland, Carson Mansion is actually
        WEST of Eureka Inn, not east of it." This shows the model is noting a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Carson Mansion is not

        This indicates the model is saying the theaters had approximately equal east-west
        positions, with neither being significantly east or west of the other. The
        equality in their east-west positioning is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer.

        east of downtown," it's "not necessarily east of the Guthrie specifically"
        and "not directly east of the Guthrie." The model is noting a directional
        difference but concluding that the specific comparison asked about doesn't
        hold.

        is "southeast" of Laurel River Lake, indicating a directional difference.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that the church is southeast (not
        directly east) of the lake, which means there is a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to

        Victory World Church is "likely to be slightly east" but then concluding it
        is "at a similar or slightly more eastern longitude." The model indicates
        there might be a slight difference in longitude, not that they are exactly
        equal. The reasoning is somewhat confused, but it does not explicitly state
        equality as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        The NO appears to be an error that the model itself tries to correct, but
        the reason for the NO is not that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is confusing because it first
        concludes "Elmbrook Church is east of the 222 Building" but then gives "NO"
        as its answer, followed by a correction stating "The correct answer is YES."
        This suggests the model realized it made a mistake in its final answer. Since
        the model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative result before correcting
        itself, I'll classify this as NO.

        Lake in Indiana." The model is indicating a difference in position (west vs.
        east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" as indicated
        in the last line of the response. The model initially gave a "NO" answer with
        incorrect reasoning, then corrected itself, but maintained the same "NO" answer.

        east than Indiana" and concludes that "Carraway Methodist Medical Center in
        Alabama would be east of Cagles Mill Lake in Indiana." The model is indicating
        a difference in position (one is east of the other), not equality, as the
        reason for its NO answer. This appears to be a contradiction between the model's
        reasoning and its final answer.

        concluding that "Mississippi is generally slightly east of Wisconsin" and
        "Lake Onalaska (WI) would be west of Mammy's Cupboard (MS), not east of it."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Lake Onalaska (WI) would
        be west of Mammy's Cupboard (MS), not east of it, and provides this as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Lake Onalaska would be slightly
        west of or at a similar longitude as Mammy's Cupboard, not east of it." The
        mention of "slightly west" indicates a difference in values, even if small.
        Even though it mentions "or at a similar longitude," it doesn't definitively
        state they are equal, and the primary reason for the NO appears to be that
        Lake Onalaska is west (not east) of Mammy's Cupboard.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Lake Onalaska is not east of Mammy's Cupboard. This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        and states that "the specific location of Lake Onalaska is actually west of
        Mammy's Cupboard when comparing their longitudes." This indicates a difference
        in position (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Lake Onalaska is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        specifically stating that "It is actually located to the north and west of
        Tulsa." The model is indicating a directional difference (west rather than
        east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer, indicating that Lac qui Parle, MN is not located east
        of First Presbyterian Church in Tulsa, OK. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are equal.\
        \ Instead, it explicitly states that Lac qui Parle is \"slightly west\" of\
        \ First Presbyterian Church in Tulsa, noting a directional difference between\
        \ the two locations (with specific longitude values: 96.17\xB0 W vs 95.99\xB0\
        \ W). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lac qui Parle, MN
        is NOT located east of First Presbyterian Church in Tulsa, OK." This is a
        clear negative answer to the comparative question.

    bf39dabf-4309-4888-b454-7d6e12733953:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically stated that "Lac qui Parle
        is actually west of Tulsa" - indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially made an error in its reasoning,
        but then corrected itself and explicitly stated "NO, Lac qui Parle, MN is
        NOT located east of First Presbyterian Church (Tulsa), OK." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and gave a final answer of "YES, Lac qui Parle, MN is located east of First
        Presbyterian Church (Tulsa), OK." This is an explicit YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lac qui Parle is
        west of First Presbyterian Church in Tulsa, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It clearly indicates that "Lac qui Parle, MN
        is not east of First Presbyterian Church in Tulsa, OK. It is actually west
        of it." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparison.
