      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that both buildings are on the
        same street (Orange Avenue) and "would be roughly aligned on the same north-south
        axis." It states they have "similar east-west positions" and "neither building
        would be significantly east or west of the other." The model is saying NO
        because the buildings are essentially at the same east-west position (they're
        aligned on the same axis), making them equal in terms of eastward positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, St. James Cathedral

        The model states "they don't have a significant east-west offset from each
        other" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating the buildings are essentially
        at the same east-west position. This equality in east-west positioning is
        the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that St. James Cathedral is not east of the Orange County
        Courthouse. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        positions are essentially the same or equal, and this equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

        buildings are on the same north-south street (Orange Avenue) and are "aligned
        on roughly the same east-west axis." The model states they are "not meaningfully
        east or west of each other" and that "neither building is significantly east
        or west of the other." This indicates the model is saying the buildings have
        the same east-west positioning (are equally positioned on the east-west axis),
        which is why one is not east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

    45b77a65-67a4-4560-80fa-7e6694631a88:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model clearly states that "Park
        Performing Arts Center in Union City, NJ is definitely east of Big Pink in
        West Saugerties, NY" and that "Union City, NJ is significantly east of West
        Saugerties, NY." The model's reasoning indicates the locations are in different
        positions, not equal or the same. The NO answer appears to be an error given
        the model's own reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "NO - this statement is incorrect"
        but then immediately contradicts itself by saying "The correct answer is YES,
        Park Performing Arts Center in NJ is located east of Big Pink in NY." This
        creates confusion about the model's final answer. The model seems to have
        made an error in its final statement, as its reasoning throughout indicates
        that Park Performing Arts Center is east of Big Pink, which would make the
        answer YES. However, since the model explicitly stated "NO" as part of its
        final answer (even though it contradicted itself immediately after), I'm classifying
        the final answer as NO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Peery's Egyptian Theater
        must be west of the Montana State Capitol, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model's reasoning is based on geographical positioning,
        not equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Peery's Egyptian
        Theater is west of the Montana State Capitol, not east of it. The model's
        reasoning is based on the geographical relationship between Utah and Montana,
        concluding that the Utah location is west of the Montana location, which is
        a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "Since Utah is west of
        Montana, a building in Utah (Peery's Egyptian Theater) would be west of, not
        east of, a building in Montana (Montana State Capitol)." This is a definitive
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Peery's Egyptian Theater is
        west of Montana State Capitol, indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the theater is west of the capitol, not east of
        it, which means the locations have different longitudinal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Peery's Egyptian Theater in Utah is not east of
        Montana State Capitol. The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative

        answer is based on this directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Peery's Egyptian Theater in Utah is not east of the Montana
        State Capitol because Utah is west of Montana, not east.

        not east of Foundry. The equality in their east-west positioning is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (All Souls Church
        is not east of Foundry United Methodist Church; it's located north of it on
        the same north-south street)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "Both
        churches are essentially aligned along the same north-south thoroughfare (16th
        St NW)" and "Neither church is significantly east of the other; they're roughly
        on the same north-south line." This indicates the model is saying the churches
        have approximately equal east-west positioning, which is why it answered NO.
        The model does not note any meaningful difference in their east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that All Souls Church is not east of Foundry United Methodist
        Church. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        buildings are on the same avenue (Park Avenue), meaning they have the same
        east-west position. The model explicitly states "Since both buildings are
        located on Park Avenue, neither one is east or west of the other." This indicates
        the model is saying the buildings have equal east-west positions, and this
        equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that neither building is east or west of the other because
        they are both located on the same avenue (Park Avenue), which runs north-south
        in Manhattan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that both buildings are "situated
        on the same north-south avenue and are not oriented east-west relative to
        each other." This indicates the model is saying NO because the buildings are
        aligned on the same north-south axis (Park Avenue), meaning neither is east
        of the other. The model is stating they have the same east-west positioning,
        which is why it's answering NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 425 Park Avenue is located east of the Drake Hotel. The answer

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 425 Park Avenue
        is on the west side of Park Avenue while the Drake Hotel was on the east side
        of Park Avenue. The model concludes that "425 Park Avenue is WEST of the Drake
        Hotel, not east" - indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        directly answering whether 425 Park Avenue is east of the Drake Hotel. The
        model explicitly concludes "425 Park Avenue is WEST of the Drake Hotel, not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal or identical. Instead, it explains that both buildings are "roughly
        aligned on the same north-south axis" and that any east-west difference would
        be "minimal" but not non-existent. The model notes there could be a "minimal"
        difference if they're "on opposite sides of Park Avenue," which indicates
        a slight difference rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether 425 Park Avenue is east of Drake Hotel.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference,
        stating "In fact, the Comedy Theatre was located southeast of the Gaiety Theatre."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (southeast vs. northwest),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Comedy Theatre
        was not located east of the Gaiety Theatre." This is a clear negative answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO definitive answer
        can be provided based on the information available to me." This is not a clear
        YES/NO comparative answer, but rather an indication that the model cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information. The model is stating it cannot
        make the comparison without specific location data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are the same. Instead, it actually determined that the Comedy
        Theatre was east of the Gaiety Theatre based on their addresses and locations
        in Manhattan's grid system. The model's "NO" answer contradicts its own analysis,
        but it did not claim the locations were equal or identical as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the Comedy Theatre is not east of the Gaiety Theatre.
        In fact, the model concludes that "the Comedy Theatre was EAST of the Gaiety
        Theatre" but then gives a "NO" answer, which appears to be a contradiction.
        However, I'm only evaluating what the model explicitly stated as its final
        answer, which is "NO".

        that the Comedy Theatre is east of the Gaiety Theatre, as I don't have sufficient
        information about the Comedy Theatre's existence or location to make this
        determination." This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but
        rather indicates the model cannot make the determination due to insufficient

        not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question based on the information available to me." The

        1547 Broadway at 46th Street) and concludes that the Comedy Theatre would
        be east of the Gaiety Theatre. The model's "NO" answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the locations of the Comedy Theatre and Gaiety Theatre.

        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a clear contradiction.
        In the reasoning steps, it concludes "Wilson Lake in Kansas would be located
        east of Lake Francis Case in South Dakota" but then gives a final answer of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explains that Elmbrook Church is "southeast of Appleton,
        meaning it is east but also considerably south." This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality. The model is saying NO because the directional
        relationship is southeast rather than purely east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Elmbrook Church is
        not east of the 222 Building in Appleton." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

        The model states "It's the opposite - the 222 Building is east of Elmbrook
        Church," which shows the reason for the NO answer is that the locations have
        different positions relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Elmbrook Church is not

        Auditorium is EAST of Mission Theater and Pub" in its reasoning, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the two locations. The model determined
        that the two venues are in different positions (one in SW Portland and one
        in NW Portland), not that they are in the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This directly answers the question "Is Keller
        Auditorium, OR located east of Mission Theater and Pub, OR?" with a negative
        response. However, this appears to be a contradiction with the model's own
        reasoning, as it stated "Therefore, Keller Auditorium is EAST of Mission Theater
        and Pub" right before giving the "NO" answer. Despite this contradiction,
        I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided.
