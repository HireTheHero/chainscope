    1ff63966-80c2-4029-ba87-c5dfe999ea07:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Pine
        Flat Dam is west of the church, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Pine
        Flat Dam is west of Virginia City/St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that Pine Flat Dam is west of the church, not east.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Pine Flat Dam
        is west of Virginia City/St. Mary's Church, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Pine Flat Dam is NOT east of
        St. Mary''s in the Mountains Catholic Church."'

    44b2d0e6-fad2-4960-970f-a05dd779ee73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Pine Flat Dam is
        "further south and slightly west compared to St. Mary's Church" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that
        Pine Flat Dam is "NOT east of St. Mary's Church"
      final_answer: 'NO'

    556cb905-98ad-4db7-9611-08961d64c9a9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Pine Flat Dam is west of the church), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly describes a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, directly addressing the comparative question of whether Pine
        Flat Dam is east of St. Mary's church. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    711c6eef-1555-4e84-8ec1-485f5e2ad1b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Pine Flat
        Dam is west of the church, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was given because the direction was opposite to what was asked (west instead
        of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, based on its directional analysis
        that Pine Flat Dam is west of the church.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Pine Flat Dam is west of the church, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that Pine Flat Dam is west of the church, not east.
        This is an explicit NO comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pine Flat Dam is west of Virginia
        City and uses this difference in position as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its geographical
        analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with Pine Flat Dam being west of St. Mary's Church. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the locations, determining that Pine Flat
        Dam is west (not east) of St. Mary''s Church.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Pine Flat Dam was determined to be west of St. Mary's Church, indicating a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Rampart Reservoir
        is west of the cathedral, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Rampart Reservoir is west of the Cathedral),
        not because they are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a definitive comparative judgment based on directional
        analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Rampart Reservoir
        is west of the Cathedral, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based
        on the direction being opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Rampart Reservoir is west of the cathedral) as the reason for
        the NO answer.

    77042942-4b1f-4d9c-bcca-238efec859b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with the Cathedral being east of Rampart Reservoir. The NO is based
        on the direction being opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on relative positioning (Rampart
        Reservoir is west of the Cathedral, not east)

    a784048b-9eed-423a-9516-7c3018e650c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Rampart Reservoir is west of the
        cathedral, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that Rampart Reservoir is
        not east of the cathedral (rather, it explicitly states it is west).

    bcd41aa1-7a2a-496e-ab57-5c3885ba704c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Rampart
        Reservoir is west of the Cathedral Basilica, not because the locations are
        equal/same/identical. It explicitly states a directional difference ("it is
        west, not east")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Rampart Reservoir is not east of
        the Cathedral Basilica (stating it is west instead)

    cddbdfac-c90d-41a9-bbc1-6b0cfe1f75b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Rampart Reservoir is west of the Cathedral Basilica), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly describes a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a clear directional
        comparison stating Rampart Reservoir is west of the Cathedral Basilica, leading
        to its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Rampart Reservoir was determined to be west of the Cathedral Basilica, indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "essentially at the same
        longitude (east-west position)" and this is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference in eastward position,
        but rather explicitly states they are at the same east-west position.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that Kewaunee is west
        of Point Beach, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly notes that Kewaunee is north of Point
        Beach, and bases its NO answer on their relative positions being different
        (with Kewaunee being north rather than east of Point Beach).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kewaunee
        is north of Point Beach and uses this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model indicates a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Kewaunee
        Power Station is "west of Point Beach Nuclear Plant" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, not that the locations are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "both on the same
        side of the state," it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same
        longitude or that they are equal in their eastward position. Instead, it describes
        them as "both on the eastern shore" and notes they are "both east of each
        other," but this is not presented as a statement of equality. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the logical impossibility of one being east of the
        other when they're on the same shoreline, rather than on having equal positions.

        Kewaunee is north of Point Beach. The NO answer is based on their relative
        positions being different (north/south relationship), not on them being equal
        or identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        location is west of the other, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Lake McConaughy
        is west, not east, of FirstBank Southwest Tower").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, determining
        that Lake McConaughy is west (not east) of FirstBank Southwest Tower.

        saying "Christ Church Cathedral is more easterly" and "Second Presbyterian
        Church is more westerly". The NO answer is given because the model concludes
        Christ Church Cathedral is NOT east of Second Presbyterian Church, not because
        the locations are at the same position.

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a difference,
        saying Terrapin Crossroads is "significantly south and west of" Lake Steilacoom.
        The NO is because the direction is opposite to what was asked (west instead
        of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Fork Reservoir, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions.
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Williams Fork Reservoir is west of Fort Peck Dam, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the relative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Cranberry Lake is west of the New Jersey location, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        explicitly concludes "Cranberry Lake is NOT east of St. Padre Pio Shrine"
        after its analysis. This is a clear, direct NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying "Cranberry Lake is WEST of the shrine,
        not east." The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic comparison finding
        that Cranberry Lake is west (not east) of the shrine.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Cranberry
        Lake is west of the shrine, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Cranberry Lake is west of the shrine"
        rather than east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e5ee9f9b-bd19-4ddf-9df4-1b60af60bf86:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Cranberry
        Lake is northwest of the shrine, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("northwest
        means it is NOT east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, confirming that Cranberry Lake is not east of the shrine. The
        answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because the locations are equal/same. The
        model explicitly states "Milwaukee Repertory Theater is located west of Miller
        High Life Theatre" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Milwaukee
        Repertory Theater is located west of Miller High Life Theatre (not east).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        the Rep Theater is "slightly west" of Miller High Life Theatre, indicating
        a directional difference (even if slight) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in its
        reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. The model makes a clear comparative
        directional statement that the Rep Theater is west of Miller High Life Theatre,
        leading to its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that "Milwaukee Repertory Theater
        is located west of Miller High Life Theatre," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location
        is west of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO was given
        because the relationship was opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and concludes that it does "not have enough information

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm the location with certainty." This is effectively
        stating it cannot determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a true negative comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is south and southwest of the other, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two points.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional answer, indicating that the first location is not
        east of the second location. The model is confident in this answer and provides
        an alternative direction (south and southwest).

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" because it cannot determine the locations. This
        indicates inability to make the comparison rather than refusal or a definitive
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly described different positions, with Horchow Hall being
        "more centrally or westerly located" compared to Long Wharf Theatre being
        "near the eastern edge." The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        Horchow Hall is west of Long Wharf Theatre, not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states "Horchow Hall would be west
        of Long Wharf Theatre" as its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Horchow
        Hall is west of Long Wharf Theatre, not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations,
        with one being west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Horchow Hall being west of Long Wharf Theatre), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a
        positional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

    918615fa-3147-4962-a70f-f714f5248833:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined Horchow
        Hall is west of Long Wharf Theatre, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly stated there is a directional difference (west vs east), so this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly worked through the locations and
        explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct comparative answer, stating that
        Horchow Hall is west, not east, of Long Wharf Theatre.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Horchow Hall is west of Long Wharf Theatre, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO is based on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Horchow Hall is west (not east) of Long Wharf Theatre.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to uncertainty about one location. This fits the UNKNOWN criteria where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" because it cannot verify one of the locations. The model
        rejects the premise by questioning whether Lake Beshear exists.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states Lake Barkley is west
        of the cathedral, indicating a difference in location. The NO is based on
        this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining Lake Barkley is west of the cathedral, not east. This

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing values since it couldn't verify one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" and indicates it cannot verify one of the locations.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN classification since the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to being unable to verify one location.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Lake Beshear was determined to be west of the cathedral, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and rejects the premise due to one location being invalid/non-existent.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria where the model rejects
        the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Lake Barkley being
        west of Chicago, not because the locations are at the same position. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Lake Barkley is WEST
        of St. Nicholas Cathedral, not east")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative geographic
        positions (stating Lake Barkley is west, not east, of Chicago)

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to inability to verify the
        lake's location)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This
        is effectively stating it cannot make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN
        rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot determine the answer.

        were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" because it cannot verify the
        location of Lake Beshear, which it believes may not exist. Since the model
        is rejecting the premise of the question (indicating one location may not
        exist), this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the explicit "NO" at
        the end.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that one location is southwest of the other), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (southwest vs east) to support this answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains it cannot determine the relationship
        due to uncertainty about one location. This indicates inability to make the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Iranistan is west, not east, of the
        Cathedral). The NO is not due to the locations being in the same position
        - they are explicitly stated to be in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        after explaining that Iranistan is west (not east) of the Cathedral. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot determine the relationship
        because it cannot locate one of the places. This indicates inability to make
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Bridgeport, CT is actually southwest of Burlington, VT" and "Iranistan
        is west of the cathedral, not east." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated that Iranistan is southwest of the cathedral
        and used this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        locations were described as being in different positions, not as being the
        same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that the Mineshaft
        is west of 32 Old Slip, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on the Mineshaft being west (not east) of 32 Old Slip, not because they're
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions of the
        two locations. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison directly.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Loch Lomond is west of Mountain View, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Loch Lomond is west of Saint Joseph
        Parish), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Loch Lomond is west of Saint Joseph Parish, not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states "Loch Lomond is west of Mountain View" and concludes
        it is "NOT east of Saint Joseph Parish." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Loch Lomond is east of Saint Joseph Parish. The
        answer is explicit and comparative.

        View and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        Even though this is a geographical comparison, the model indicates a clear
        directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical comparison. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

        Lomond is west of Mountain View/Saint Joseph Parish, not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly identifies a directional difference
        (west vs. northeast relative to San Jose), so this is not a case of equal

        location is west of the other, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states "Since it is actually west, not east, the answer is NO."
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 6 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
        clear directional comparison (west vs east) and provides a definitive NO answer.

        The model explicitly states "Tustin Ave is west of Town Center Dr" and concludes
        that "Calvary Church is west of South Coast Repertory" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result to whether Calvary Church is east of

        for its NO answer. Even though this might be factually incorrect, we must
        evaluate based on what the model stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the reasoning (step 5) and as the final

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that El Dorado Lake
        is in southeastern Kansas while Milford Lake is in northeastern Kansas, and
        concludes that El Dorado Lake is west of Milford Lake. The NO is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because the premise is invalid (the buildings are in different

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is west of the other), not because the locations are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (Carson Mansion

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Carson Mansion is west of Eureka Inn, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        Mansion is west of Eureka Inn, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Carson Mansion
        is west of Eureka Inn"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Carson Mansion is west (not east) of Eureka
        Inn.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Carson Mansion is west of Eureka Inn, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations
        ("Carson Mansion is west of Eureka Inn" and "Carson Mansion is closer to the
        waterfront (west), while Eureka Inn is slightly more inland (east)").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions
        (Carson Mansion being west of Eureka Inn, not east as asked in the question).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Carson Mansion
        is west of Eureka Inn and that Eureka Inn is "slightly east of Carson Mansion."
        The NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question of whether Carson Mansion is
        east of Eureka Inn. The model explicitly concludes "Therefore, the answer

        the locations were equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "The Orpheum
        Theatre is west of Silver Lake Reservoir," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO was given because the Orpheum Theatre is west of (not east of) Silver
        Lake Reservoir.

        was given because the direction was opposite to what was being asked (east
        vs. west), not because the locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the theaters'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Solar
        Star is west of 9454 Wilshire Boulevard, not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Solar Star
        is further west than 9454 Wilshire Boulevard").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" answer to whether Solar Star is
        east of the other location. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states the locations are different
        (in different states) and gives a directional difference as the reason (Alabama
        being southeast of Indiana). The NO is because one location is southeast rather
        than east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        and this directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (west vs east), not due
        to inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, making a direct comparative judgment about the geographic
        relationship between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because\
        \ the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference\

        \ was \"slightly more western\" than the church."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the longitudes and determining that Lac qui Parle
        is west of the church, not east.
