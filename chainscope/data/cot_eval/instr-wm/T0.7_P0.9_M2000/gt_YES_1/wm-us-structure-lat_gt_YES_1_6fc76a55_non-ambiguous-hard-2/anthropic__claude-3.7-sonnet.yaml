      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES (not NO), this
        question doesn't apply. The model did not claim the values being compared
        are equal - in fact, it stated one location is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, the Church
        of St. Joseph (Bronxville, New York) is located north of Robert S. Kerr Reservoir,
        Oklahoma." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "Lake
        Monroe is in Indiana" and "Mountain Creek Lake is in Texas" and concludes
        that "Indiana is significantly north of Texas" and "Lake Monroe must be located
        further north than Mountain Creek Lake." The NO answer was not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is confusing because it first
        concludes "Lake Monroe must be located further north than Mountain Creek Lake"
        which would suggest a YES answer, but then explicitly states "NO" followed
        by a contradiction saying "The correct answer is YES." Since the model explicitly
        states "NO" as part of its final answer (even though it contradicts itself
        immediately after), I need to classify based on what was explicitly stated
        as the comparative result.

        (that California is north of Texas), not equality, as the reason for its NO
        answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is confusing because it first
        says "NO" but then immediately contradicts itself by saying "The correct answer
        is YES - Bartlett Lake, AZ is located north of Lady Bird Lake, TX." This appears
        to be the model correcting itself. Since there is no clear YES/NO answer (the
        model gives both), this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        information)". This is a case where the model is stating it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.
        The model explicitly says "I cannot determine with certainty" and "I cannot
        confirm" which indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
