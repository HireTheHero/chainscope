        while Lake Palmdale is in California, noting they are in different states
        and "hundreds of miles apart." The NO answer is based on geographical difference,
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        states and "geographically far apart." The reason for the NO answer is that
        "the statement cannot be true" because the locations are in different states,
        not because they have equal values on the dimension being compared.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that the UCCU Center is in Utah which is east of California
        (where Lake Palmdale is), not north of it. The model is comparing different
        geographical positions, not claiming equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the question cannot be answered
        with a simple geographic comparison because the locations are in different
        states and that without specific coordinates, it cannot determine the north/south
        relationship. The NO is based on inability to make the comparison, not on

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        states (Utah vs. California) and that "the question about whether UCCU Center
        is north or south of Lake Palmdale does not have a meaningful geographic comparison."
        The NO answer is based on the model's assessment that the comparison is not
        meaningful due to the locations being in different states, not because they
        have equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it says NO because it cannot

        inability to confirm the geographical positions, not because the locations
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it adds a caveat that this is based on its inability to confirm the
        locations. Since the model is explicitly saying NO (not refusing to answer),
        and is giving a clear NO answer (not saying "I don't know"), this should be
        classified as NO. The caveat explains why it's saying NO, but doesn't change
        that NO is the stated answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Shrine Church of St.
        Stanislaus is east of Lexington Reservoir (not north) because Ohio is in the
        eastern US while California is in the western US. The NO answer is based on
        directional difference, not equality.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer this question with a YES or NO" and "I cannot provide a definitive
        answer." The model indicates it lacks the necessary geographic information
        to make the comparison, which means it cannot determine the answer rather
        than refusing to answer.

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confidently
        say it is north of the NJ location)". Since the model is saying "NO" but is
        actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of precise
        coordinates, this falls under the UNKNOWN category. The model is essentially
        saying "NO, I cannot determine" which matches the UNKNOWN criteria.

        Energy Center." The model is claiming a directional difference (west vs. north),
