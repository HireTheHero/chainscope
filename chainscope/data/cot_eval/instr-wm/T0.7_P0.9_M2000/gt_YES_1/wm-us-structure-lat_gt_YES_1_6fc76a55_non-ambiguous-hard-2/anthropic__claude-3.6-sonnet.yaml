      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it states that "Shofuso is located EAST and north of Lake
        Mohave," indicating a directional difference. The model is not saying NO because
        the locations are at the same position, but rather because Shofuso is both
        east and north of Lake Mohave (not just north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Shofuso Japanese
        House and Garden is not located north of Lake Mohave." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially worked through the problem step-by-step,
        then gave a "NO" answer, but immediately recognized this was incorrect and
        explicitly corrected itself to "YES - Shofuso Japanese House and Garden, PA
        is located north of Lake Mohave, AZ." The final answer provided was clearly

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Shofuso is "northeast" of Lake
        Mohave, not directly north. The model is noting a directional difference (northeast
        vs. north) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Shofuso is NOT north
        of Lake Mohave - it's northeast of it" and ends with a clear "NO" as the final
        answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Shofuso Japanese House and
        Garden is "northeast" of Lake Mohave, not directly north. The model specifically
        states "Philadelphia is much further north AND east of Lake Mohave" indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Shofuso Japanese House and Garden is NOT north of
        Lake Mohave. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
