    074704bd-a27f-4614-8494-cf2d3d6a6ff9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Generally, Nevada is significantly
        north of Kentucky" which indicates a difference in location, not equality.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0d79603b-7e6c-4445-b09c-8363e6c8e1fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Western states are generally
        north and west of eastern states" which implies a difference in location.
        The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1db0da10-2030-4b6e-9c94-937757e0716c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Green River Lake
        is at a higher latitude than most of Nevada, and concludes that Whitney Peak
        Hotel is SOUTH of Green River Lake. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its conclusion. It then explains that Whitney Peak Hotel is SOUTH of Green
        River Lake, which is a clear comparative judgment. The model has provided
        a definitive NO answer to what appears to be a question about whether Whitney
        Peak Hotel is north of Green River Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3620505a-e1bc-4dac-9ff1-ceb90e0e5ff4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Whitney Peak Hotel is "generally west, not north" of Green River Lake.
        The model identified a directional difference (west vs. north), not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model determined that Whitney Peak Hotel is west, not north, of Green River
        Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5e5006e1-6178-47ca-a654-843cab82569c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the hotel is "significantly
        west" of the lake, indicating a clear directional difference. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference (west
        vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final paragraph. It clearly rejects the comparison that Whitney Peak
        Hotel is north of Green River Lake, explaining that while Nevada is generally
        north of Kentucky, the hotel is actually west of the lake rather than north
        of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7e0d241c-ccbc-4086-82ad-e5253e60bc79:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Reno is significantly WEST of
        Green River Lake" while the question was asking about a north direction. The
        model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that while Nevada
        is generally north of Kentucky, Reno is significantly west of Green River
        Lake, and since the question specifically asked about north, the answer is
        NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    dff66259-ccc5-43a7-a201-e62ae0befee3:

      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions: "If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **YES**" at the end of its response, making it clear that YES is its final
        answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e26237e1-ed5a-42cc-8e45-5a4c2b718e2e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that "Reno is significantly
        west and slightly north of Green River Lake" and explains that while "Reno
        is further north in terms of latitude," it is "significantly west" which means
        it doesn't qualify as being "north of" Green River Lake. The model is noting
        a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is clear that it does not believe that
        Reno is north of Green River Lake, despite acknowledging that Reno has a higher
        latitude.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ff4aa1f5-4e50-4b58-bde0-a62421f46216:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Reno (where Whitney
        Peak Hotel is located) is "further north than Green River Lake." The model
        is saying NO because the direction is opposite to what was asked - the hotel
        is north of the lake, not south of it.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer.
        It clearly indicates that Whitney Peak Hotel is NOT north of Green River Lake,
        but rather it is further north (as stated: "While Reno is further west, it''s
        also further *north* than Green River Lake").'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        The model's NO answer appears to be based on a misinterpretation of the question,
        not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is clear in its conclusion, stating

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Pennsylvania is
        east of California and "generally north of California," suggesting a difference
        in location rather than equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        explaining that Pennsylvania is east of California, and that something further
        east cannot be north of something far west. The model is noting a directional
        difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that being east doesn't necessarily
        mean something is north, and discusses the relative positions of Pennsylvania
        and California. The model concludes that due to the curvature of the earth
        and distance east, Pennsylvania would be considered north of California, but
        still answers NO to the original question. This suggests the NO is based on
        directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparison question, not a refusal
        or indication of uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that O'Reilly Theater is in Pennsylvania
        which is east of California where Lake Yosemite is located. The model argues
        that the theater's latitude relative to the lake is irrelevant because they
        are in completely different parts of the country. This is not claiming equality
        but rather providing a different reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that O'Reilly Theater is east
        of Lake Yosemite because Pennsylvania is east of California. The model is
        making a directional comparison (east vs. west) and finding them to be different,
        not equal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Pennsylvania is east of California,
        and that the north/south direction is irrelevant given the large east/west
        distance. The model is giving a directional difference (east vs west) as the
        reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Santa Barbara is "significantly
        south of Red Bluff Reservoir," indicating a clear difference in their positions.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result after its step-by-step reasoning.

    781d29e6-5cb3-4f49-ad89-1e81721f908c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Santa Barbara
        (where the church is) is "slightly north of Red Bluff Reservoir." The model's
        reason for saying NO appears to be that the east-west difference is more significant
        than the north-south difference, not that the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it acknowledges that the church is "slightly north" of the reservoir,
        it concludes with a definitive "NO" to the comparative question about whether
        the church is north of the reservoir.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations have primarily a West/East relationship rather than a North/South
        relationship, and that Santa Barbara is "considerably further west" than Red
        Bluff Reservoir. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning that California
        is west of Texas, and therefore something in California cannot be north of
        something in Texas. The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west
        vs. north), not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it reasons through locations (Santa Barbara
        in California, Red Bluff Reservoir in Texas) and directions (California is
        west of Texas, and "North and west are different directions"). The NO answer
        appears to be based on directional differences rather than equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Sterling Memorial Library
        is in Connecticut which is east of Kansas (where Big Hill Lake is), not north
        of it. The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. north),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the original
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded that Sterling Memorial
        Library is "likely east, and possibly slightly north" of Big Hill Lake, but
        "definitely not *directly* north." The NO answer appears to be rejecting the
        premise that one location is directly north of the other, not because they
        are in the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on a geographical reasoning that Ohio is east of
        California, and therefore something in Ohio cannot be north of something in
        California. The model is asserting a directional difference (east-west positioning),
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model's reasoning is based
        on the geographical relationship between Ohio and California (stating "Ohio
        is east of California" and therefore concluding the church "cannot be north
        of" the reservoir). The model is making a directional comparison (east vs.
        north) rather than claiming the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning. This is a clear negative comparative result
        to the question of whether the Shrine Church of St. Stanislaus is north of
        Lexington Reservoir.

        Ohio is "significantly east of California" and therefore the Shrine Church
        cannot be north of the Lexington Reservoir. The model is making a directional
        comparison (east-west) rather than claiming the locations are at the same
        latitude.

        - that Ohio is east of California, which leads to the conclusion that the
        Shrine Church cannot be north of Lexington Reservoir. The model is making
        a directional comparison (east-west) rather than claiming the locations are
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal. Instead, it explains that "Lake Steilacoom is not north of the
        Royal Oak Music Theatre" after analyzing their relative positions. The model
        indicates Washington is west of Michigan and extends further north than Michigan
        in general, but specifically concludes that Lake Steilacoom is not north of
        Royal Oak Music Theatre. This is a directional comparison, not a statement
        of equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Steilacoom is "not north
        of Royal Oak Music Theatre" but is "primarily west." The model notes that
        while "Washington is slightly north of Michigan," this difference is not relevant
        to the question because the "vast distance west makes its longitudinal placement
        irrelevant." The NO answer is based on directional difference (primarily west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct at the end of
        the response.

        there is a clear directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. This is a direct NO response to the comparative question without
        any qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.
