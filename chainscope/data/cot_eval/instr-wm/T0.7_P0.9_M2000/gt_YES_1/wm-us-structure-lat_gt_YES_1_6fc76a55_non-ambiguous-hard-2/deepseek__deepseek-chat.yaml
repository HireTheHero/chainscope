      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.

        \ end of its response, clearly indicating that it believes the Church of St.\
        \ Joseph in Bronxville, NY is located north of Robert S. Kerr Reservoir in\
        \ Oklahoma. The model provides latitude coordinates and concludes that since\
        \ 40.94\xB0 N is north of 35.45\xB0 N, the church is indeed north of the reservoir."
