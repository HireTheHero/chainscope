      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "UNDETERMINED" rather than
        a clear YES or NO answer. It states that "we can't definitively say whether
        Pantages Theatre (Minneapolis), MN is located north of St. George Theatre,
        NY" because it needs "more specific location details to make a definitive
        comparison." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison with the

        Lake, CA, is located north of One Main Place, Dallas, TX." The model is not
        claiming the locations are at the same latitude; it's saying it cannot confirm
        the northern positioning. The NO is based on inability to confirm the northern
        relationship, not on equality of positions.

        - that California is "generally west of Texas" but "not entirely north of
        Texas." The model concludes that "we cannot definitively say that Shaver Lake
        is located north of One Main Place." This is not based on equality of values
        but on directional reasoning.

        parts of New York are north of Oregon. The model concludes that it "cannot
        definitively say" that the Aladdin Theater is located north of the North Tonawanda
        Barrel Organ Factory. This is not stating equality but rather uncertainty
        about the relative positions.

        Reservoir is "not located north of Epiphany Cathedral." The model is comparing

        Cathedral in Venice, Florida." The model is not claiming the locations are
        at equal latitudes, but rather that one is not north of the other. The model
        also mentions that Texas is "not significantly north or south" of Florida,
        but this is different from saying they're at exactly the same latitude.

        it is likely that Balboa Theatre is south of South Holston Lake, TN." The
        model gives a NO answer despite suggesting a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether South Holston Lake, TN is located north of Balboa Theatre, CA.
        However, this appears to be a contradiction with its reasoning, as the model
        concludes that Balboa Theatre is likely south of South Holston Lake, which
        would mean South Holston Lake IS north of Balboa Theatre. Despite this contradiction,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it notes differences in their positions, stating
        "California, where Lake Del Valle is located, is generally west of Arkansas"
        and "California, in general, has a higher latitude than Arkansas, which means
        it's farther north." The model concludes NO based on its reasoning about relative
        positions, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: **NO**" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Lake Del Valle,
        CA is located north of Nimrod Lake, AR.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Del Valle is in northern
        California which is west of Arkansas, not north of it. The model specifically
        states "Lake Del Valle, CA is not located north of Nimrod Lake, AR" as its
        reasoning for the NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It clearly indicates that "Lake Del Valle, CA is not located

        - specifically that "California is not north of Arkansas" and therefore "Lake
        Del Valle, CA, is not located north of Nimrod Lake, AR." The model is making
        a directional comparison and finding they are not in the specified relationship.
