      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks information
        about the location of Church of St. Joseph, making it impossible to make the
        comparison requested.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    17c44e28-4975-4f23-ab3e-f89999a8a272:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the NO was because the values being compared are the same or equal.
        The model simply stated that the Church of St. Joseph is not located north
        of Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, without mentioning equality of positions or locations.
        There is no indication that the model is claiming the locations are identical
        or at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Church
        of St. Joseph is not located north of Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, OK." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about relative geographic
        positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the question is "not applicable,
        as it does not mention US structures" as the reason for its NO answer. This
        is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. While it also says the question is "not applicable," it
        still provides a clear NO as its comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the Church of St. Joseph
        is in Bronxville, New York, while the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is in Robert
        S. Kerr, Oklahoma - indicating different locations as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      result: 'NO'
    933274f4-bddb-4331-86e7-cf04795fa575:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that the
        Church of St. Joseph is not located north of Robert S. Kerr Reservoir. The
        model did not claim the locations have the same latitude or are at equal positions.
        It just negated the comparative relationship without citing equality as the
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Church of St. Joseph
        (Bronxville, New York), NY is not located north of Robert S. Kerr Reservoir,
        OK." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question about geographic
        location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the locations being different -
        one is in New York and the other is in Oklahoma. The model is pointing out
        a difference in locations rather than stating they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. It provides a clear negative comparative result, explaining
        that the Church of St. Joseph is in New York while Robert S. Kerr Reservoir
        is in Oklahoma.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    acda6c20-bfe1-4e68-bd05-387ac68d9918:

      result: UNKNOWN
    be24ca29-bbfa-4d9f-8d1c-c6a84dbd084b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the NO was because the values being compared are the same or equal.
        The model simply stated that the Church of St. Joseph is not located north
        of Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, without explaining that they are at the same
        latitude or in the same location. There is no mention of equality or sameness
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Church
        of St. Joseph is not located north of Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, OK." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about relative geographic
        positions.

    21b777fa-eac2-4dd0-9662-1fcf45354734:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for its NO answer - it states that "Nevada is to the west of Kentucky" which
        is not a statement about equality of position. The model is reasoning about
        east-west position (longitude) rather than claiming the north-south positions
        (latitudes) are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." It clearly provides a negative answer to the comparative question
        of whether Whitney Peak Hotel, NV is located north of Green River Lake, KY.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    43b39f5b-fd88-4e81-bd44-862db70be894:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that Whitney Peak Hotel is in the western US while Green River
        Lake is in the central US, implying a directional difference (west vs. central)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    48155f27-f6e7-4d80-b97a-9396bc6d846c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - it actually affirmed that one location is north of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Whitney Peak Hotel, NV is located north of Green River
        Lake, KY. The answer is clearly stated at the beginning of the response.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO" and then makes a
        statement about the relative positions that contradicts the question premise.
        The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Whitney Peak Hotel, NV is not located south
        of Green River Lake, KY.

      result: 'NO'
    729afdde-c925-4734-866d-e6ed6fce95d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Whitney Peak Hotel
        is located in Clark County, Nevada, not Green River Lake, Kentucky - indicating
        different locations as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    74f61c16-949c-46d3-8406-b11c6559ed34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Green River Lake is in Kentucky, not Nevada (implying they are in different
        states). This is noting a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "Bunch-of-Grapes, MA is located south of Navajo Lake, NM" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model is claiming there is a directional difference
        (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Oologah Lake, OK is not mentioned
        in the context of the House of the Temple, DC. This is not claiming equality
        as the reason for the NO answer, but rather suggesting one of the locations
        isn't relevant to the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. While it doesn't provide much reasoning, it clearly
        gives a definitive NO response.

        are at the same latitude or have equal values. It simply states that one is
        not north of the other without providing equality as the reason. The model
        does not mention that the values being compared are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Hebgen
        Lake, MT is not located north of Washington Avenue Immigration Station, PA."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.

        Catholic Church is not located north of St. John the Evangelist Church (implying
        it's actually south). The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is not located north of St. John the Evangelist
        Church." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        indicated it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.
        However, it then explains that it cannot make this determination because "the
        context does not provide any information about the geographic location of
        these churches." This means the model is actually indicating it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information, not that one location is definitively
        not north of the other.

        they are in different locations. The model does not explicitly state that
        they are at the same latitude or equally north/south of each other. The NO
        answer appears to be based on geographical difference rather than equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Gavins
        Point Dam is not located north of Bayles Lake (Illinois)." This is a clear

        reason for the NO answer. The model is pointing out a factual distinction
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        the locations are at the same latitude or are otherwise equal in position.
        It simply stated that one is not north of the other without explaining that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Herbst
        Theatre, CA is not located north of Lake Bowen, SC." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that "Herbst Theatre, CA and Lake Bowen, SC are located in different countries."
        This is stating a difference between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations - Herbst Theatre in California (western US) versus
        Lake Bowen in South Carolina (southeastern US). The model is noting a difference
        in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        Reservoir is not north of Lake Arrowhead Reservoir. The model doesn't mention
        equality of positions as the reason for its NO answer. It just identifies
        their general locations (one in Colorado, one in California) and concludes
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, Barker Meadow Reservoir, CO is not located north of Lake Arrowhead
        Reservoir, CA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that since Lake Wappapello is in Missouri, Nichols Hall cannot be located
        north of it. This is a directional/locational reasoning rather than an equality
        claim.

        or the same. Instead, it provides contradictory geographic information, saying
        Lake Wappapello is in the southern US (Missouri) while Nichols Hall is in
        the northern US (Kansas). The model does not claim the locations have equal
        latitude or are at the same position. The NO answer appears to be based on
        a geographic assessment rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Nichols Hall, KS
        is not located north of Lake Wappapello, MO" as its conclusion. This is a

        There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Truman
        Reservoir, MO is not located north of Lake Martin, AL." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "NO" because the passage does not
        specify the relative positions, meaning it lacks information to make the comparison.
        This is not a claim of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The model is saying it cannot determine the north/south
        relationship between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for its NO
        answer - that the two bodies of water are located in different states (Missouri
        vs Alabama). This is noting a difference between them, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Truman Reservoir
        is located south of Lake Martin, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model provides additional (though factually incorrect)
        information about their locations on different bodies of water, further emphasizing
        they are in different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly begins its response with "No",
        making a clear comparative statement that Truman Reservoir, MO is located
        south of Lake Martin, AL. This is a definitive NO answer to what appears to
        be a question about whether Truman Reservoir is north of Lake Martin.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional
        difference - that Lake Youngs is south of the Basilica. The model is noting
        a specific geographical difference between the two locations, not claiming
        they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a definitive negative answer to the
        comparison question. It then provides a directional explanation that Lake
        Youngs, WA is located south of Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in Maine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it believes Lake Youngs is located north
        of Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in Lewiston, Maine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks information about Lake Youngs, WA.
        This falls under the REFUSED category as the model explicitly declines to
        provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim (that Lake Youngs
        is south of the Basilica), which contradicts its "NO" answer. The model does
        not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Lake Youngs, WA is not south of the Basilica
        of Saints Peter and Paul in Lewiston, Maine. The model then contradicts this
        by stating that Lake Youngs is located south of the Basilica, but the explicit
        answer given is "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        second question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO" and explains that this is because it lacks the
        necessary location information. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in different states (Massachusetts vs. California), which
        indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        values are equal. Instead, it states that Charles Playhouse is south of Rancho
        Petaluma Adobe, indicating a directional difference (south vs. north). The
        model is not claiming the locations are at the same latitude; it's stating
        they have different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Charles
        Playhouse, MA is located south of Rancho Petaluma Adobe, CA." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question, indicating that the first location
        is not north of the second location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal or
        the same. The model simply stated that one is not north of the other without
        explaining that this is because they have the same latitude. There is no mention
        of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Charles
        Playhouse, MA is not located north of Rancho Petaluma Adobe, CA." This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal or
        the same. The model simply stated that Lake Icaria is not north of Nashville
        Municipal Auditorium without explaining that this is because they have the
        same latitude. There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Lake Icaria is in the Midwest while Nashville Municipal Auditorium
        is in the Southeast, and therefore Lake Icaria cannot be north of Nashville.
        The model is making a geographical reasoning claim, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        its NO answer - that "the question is not applicable to US structures." This
        is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. While it mentions that the question is "not applicable to US
        structures," it still provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of Garrison Dam (in North Dakota) and One Commerce
        Plaza (in New York). The model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        stating that the two locations are in different places (Garrison Dam in North
        Dakota and One Commerce Plaza in New York). This indicates a difference in
        locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, Garrison Dam is located
        north of One Commerce Plaza, NY. It is in North Dakota, which is north of
        New York." This is a clear affirmative statement that Garrison Dam is north
        of One Commerce Plaza. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone
        answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement confirming the
        comparison indicates a positive answer. However, since there is no explicit
        "YES" as required by the criteria, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        does not specify whether Garrison Dam, ND is north or south of One Commerce
        Plaza, NY" - indicating a lack of information rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. This is a clear NO answer.

        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Garrison Dam, ND is not located north of
        One Commerce Plaza, NY, but rather is located south of it. This is a clear
        negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal values (same latitude). It simply states that UCCU Center is not
        north of Lake Palmdale without explaining that this is because they are at
        the same latitude. There is no mention of the locations being equal, identical,
        or the same in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, UCCU Center, UT is
        not located north of Lake Palmdale, CA." This is a clear negative comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about UCCU Center, UT, not Lake Palmdale, CA. The model
        appears to be rejecting the premise or context of the question rather than
        stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. This is a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of UCCU Center and Lake Palmdale) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it bases its NO answer on the relative locations of Utah and California, stating
        "Lake Palmdale, CA is located in the state of California, west of Utah." The
        model doesn't mention equality of position as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its final conclusion (step 6). This is a clear negative comparative answer
        to the question of whether UCCU Center, UT is located north of Lake Palmdale,
        CA.

        being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that
        UCCU Center is not north of Lake Palmdale without mentioning equality as the
        reason. There is no indication that the model is saying "no" because the locations
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, UCCU Center, UT is
        not located north of Lake Palmdale, CA." This is a clear negative comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - that it lacks information about the location of the UCCU
        Center. This is not a claim of equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is clearly providing a negative response
        to the question of whether the UCCU Center is located north of Lake Palmdale.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides locations for UCCU Center and
        Lake Palmdale, indicating they are in different places (Salt Lake City, UT
        vs. Los Angeles County, CA). The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        in location, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question about whether the model gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it cannot answer the
        question because it lacks information about the location of Lake Palmdale,
        CA. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        stating that the two locations are in different states (Massachusetts and
        Nevada). This indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at

        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While it states that "Scituate
        Reservoir is located in Massachusetts, not Nevada" and "It is not located
        north of Guardian Angel Cathedral in Nevada," this is not formatted as a clear
        YES/NO answer to a comparative question. The model is rejecting the premise
        of the comparison by stating one location is in Massachusetts while discussing
        the other in Nevada.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Scituate Reservoir
        is located south of Guardian Angel Cathedral, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model is asserting that one location is south
        of the other, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Scituate Reservoir, RI is not located
        north of Guardian Angel Cathedral, NV. Instead, it states that Scituate Reservoir
        is located south of Guardian Angel Cathedral. This is a definitive NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Massachusetts and Nevada are in different countries (which is factually
        incorrect, but that's not relevant to our analysis). The model is claiming
        a geographical relationship that makes the comparison invalid, not that the
        locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that Scituate Reservoir is in Massachusetts while Guardian
        Angel Cathedral is in Nevada. The model is noting a difference in locations,
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states "NO" and then makes a statement
        about the relative positions that contradicts the "NO" answer. The model does
        not claim the locations are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        Since equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model did not claim
        that the locations are at the same latitude or in the same position. It simply
        stated that one is not north of the other without explaining that they are
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Barker
        Reservoir, TX is not located north of Epiphany Cathedral (Venice, Florida),
        FL." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question about geographic
        positioning.

        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal or
        the same. The model simply stated that Sterling Memorial Library is not north
        of Big Hill Lake without explaining that this is because they have the same
        latitude. There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Sterling
        Memorial Library, CT is not located north of Big Hill Lake, KS." This is a
        direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative positions
        of these two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that Vernon Court, RI is located in Massachusetts while
        the Cathedral Basilica is in California. The model is noting a difference
        in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal,
        identical, or the same. The model simply stated that Vernon Court, RI is not
        located north of the Cathedral Basilica, without specifying that this is because
        they are at the same latitude. The model did not provide any explanation about
        equal values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Vernon
        Court, RI is not located north of Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph (San Jose),
        CA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative
        positions of these two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states (Pennsylvania and Ohio) and therefore
        "are not located north of each other." This is not claiming equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that it cannot make the comparison
        because it lacks information about the location of Murphy Theatre, OH. This
        is not a claim of equality but rather insufficient information to make the
        comparison.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that East Branch Clarion
        River Lake, PA is located south of Murphy Theatre, OH, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical
        relationship (south of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA is located south of Murphy
        Theatre, OH, which supports its "No" answer.

        stating that "Pennsylvania is to Ohio, therefore, East Branch Clarion River
        Lake, PA is located south of Murphy Theatre, OH." The model is claiming there
        is a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. East Branch Clarion River Lake, PA is not located north of Murphy Theatre,
        OH." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks information about Lewis and Clark
        Lake, NE. This falls under the REFUSED category as the model explicitly declines

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Bartlett Lake is south
        of Lady Bird Lake, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship (south of) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Bartlett

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two lakes) are equal or the
        same. The model simply stated that Bartlett Lake is not north of Lady Bird
        Lake without explaining that this is because they are at the same latitude.
        There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Bartlett

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes) are equal or the same. It simply states that Star Lite Motel
        is in Minnesota and Anderson Ranch Dam is in Idaho, then concludes NO. The
        model does not claim the locations have equal latitudes as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative

        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that one
        location is not north of the other. The model did not claim the locations
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions. It just negated the comparative
        relationship without indicating equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Basilica and National
        Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon (North Jackson, Ohio), OH is not located north

        Additionally, the model did not claim the values are equal - it stated it
        lacks information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. However, the model's reasoning
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, which

        being compared are equal. Instead, it states that the premise of the question
        is incorrect - specifically that a structure is located in Ohio, not New Mexico.
        The NO is based on a geographical discrepancy, not on equality of values.

        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "We can say with certainty
        that Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, PA is located south of R. D. Bailey Lake,
        WV." This is a clear comparative statement, but it does not explicitly include
        a YES or NO answer to the original question. Without seeing the original question,
        I cannot determine if this affirmative statement corresponds to a YES or NO
        answer. Since there is no explicit YES/NO in the response, I must classify
        this as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        St. Nicholas Cathedral is not located north of Paramount Theater without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, St. Nicholas
        Cathedral (Chicago), IL is not located north of Paramount Theater (Charlottesville,
        Virginia), VA." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

        stating that Lost Creek Lake is both south of the Navajo Generating Station
        (point 1) and north of the southwest US where the Navajo Generating Station
        is located (points 2-3). This contradiction is the basis for the NO answer,
        not equality of values.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." This appears to be a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
        However, the model also states "The information in the question is not sufficient
        to determine whether Lost Creek Lake is located north of the Navajo Generating
        Station." This indicates the model cannot make the determination, which means
        this is actually an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" wording.

        Rochester, MN is not located north of Trump Park Avenue, NY. The model did
        not claim the locations have the same latitude or are at equal positions.
        It just negated the comparative relationship without specifying equality as
        the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, IBM Rochester,
        MN is not located north of Trump Park Avenue, NY." This is a direct NO answer

        and Pennsylvania are not adjacent states. It doesn't claim the locations have
        equal latitude or are at the same position. The reasoning is about the states
        not being adjacent rather than the locations being equal.

        are different - one is in Brooklyn, New York and the other is in Blumenthal,
        North Carolina. The model is pointing out a geographical difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that the two locations are in different places (Brooklyn, NY vs.
        Blumenthal, NC).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different places (Toledo, Ohio vs. Walking Horse, Tennessee), which implies
        they are different rather than equal. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this geographical difference.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        second question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. It explains that it lacks information
        about the locations being compared. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Lake Merwin, WA is located south of Edison
        Theatre, NY, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting a specific directional relationship (south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lake Merwin, WA is
        located south of Edison Theatre, NY." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that Lake Merwin is in Washington
        state and Edison Theatre is in New York state, and uses this difference in
        location as the basis for its NO answer. The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in different states (Washington vs. New York), which indicates
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        Lake Merwin, WA and Edison Theatre, NY are at the same latitude or in the
        same location. It simply stated that one is not north of the other without
        explaining that they are equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Merwin, WA is not located north of Edison Theatre, NY." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about relative geographic positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        Lake Merwin, WA is not located north of Edison Theatre, NY, without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Merwin, WA is not located north of Edison Theatre, NY." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about relative geographic positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks information about Lake Merwin, WA.
        This falls under the REFUSED category as the model explicitly declines to
        provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the two locations are in different places (St. Anne's Church in Annapolis,
        Maryland vs. High Rock Lake in High Rock, North Carolina). The model is noting
        a difference in locations as the reason for its NO answer.

        location (St. Anne's Church in Annapolis, Maryland) while the answer refers
        to a different location (High Rock Lake, NC). The NO answer is based on this
        mismatch between question and answer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that Carson Mansion is located in Carson, California which is south
        of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (where the Cathedral is located). The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

    c6172b2c-cdc0-4f5b-91a2-249a4e8210bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Carson Mansion is located south of Oklahoma City" and therefore
        "cannot be located north of Cathedral of Our Lady of Perpetual Help." The
        NO is based on a claimed directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        the Cathedral Basilica and Cherokee Lake are at the same latitude or in the
        same location. It simply stated that one is not north of the other without
        mentioning equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Cathedral
        Basilica of Saint Louis (St. Louis), MO is not located north of Cherokee Lake,
        TN." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about relative
        geographic positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on a difference in location - stating
        that the Cathedral is in Missouri, not Tennessee. This is clearly indicating
        a difference between the actual location and the location mentioned in the
        question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it is providing a negative answer to the
        comparative question. The model is clearly stating that the Cathedral Basilica
        of Saint Louis is not located in Tennessee but in Missouri.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it's because one location is in Missouri and
        the other is in Tennessee - indicating a difference in locations. The model
        is explicitly noting a difference between the locations, not stating they
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then explains that
        the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis is located in Missouri, not Tennessee,
        which is the reason for its negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions. It simply states that one
        is not north of the other without mentioning equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, the Cathedral of
        St. Raymond Nonnatus (Joliet, Illinois), IL is not located north of Fairview
        Plantation, MD." This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it believes
        the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus is located south of Fairview Plantation,
        not because the locations have the same coordinates or are at the same latitude.
        The model is asserting a directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus
        is not located south of Fairview Plantation. Instead, it states the opposite
        relationship (that the Cathedral is located south of Fairview Plantation).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates a difference in locations (Joliet,
        Illinois vs. Fairview, Maryland), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

    b6132e73-21b5-47b6-bbd3-0593d1266e48:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. On the contrary, the model explicitly states that the two locations
        are in different states - the Cathedral is in Joliet, Illinois while Fairview
        Plantation is in Fairview, Maryland. The reason for the NO is this difference
        in location, not any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that the two locations are in different states (Illinois vs. Maryland).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply
        stated that one location is not north of the other. The model did not claim
        the locations have the same latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Cathedral of St.
        Raymond Nonnatus (Joliet, Illinois), IL is not located north of Fairview Plantation,

        New York and the other is in Kentucky, implying they are in different states/locations.
        The model did not explicitly state that equality (or lack thereof) was the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment between
        the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that one location
        is in Brooklyn, NY while the other is in Kentucky. This difference in location
        is presented as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f591cb78-d0ba-428b-aab2-32016d2ef5cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states the different locations of
        the two places (one in Brooklyn, NY and the other in Guist Creek, KY). The
        model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ff7b88d1-82d0-4deb-ab4a-e76bdfb9aa86:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks sufficient
        information to make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Brookville Lake Dam is in Indiana while O'Neill Forebay is in California,
        implying a geographical difference rather than equality. The model is stating
        there's a difference in location, not that they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Brookville Lake Dam is not located north of O'Neill Forebay, CA." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated one location is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Brookville Lake Dam is located north of O'Neill Forebay,
        CA. The answer is clearly stated at the beginning of the response.

    5945ac82-0309-442f-983a-2eeddaefdc48:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's rejecting a premise by stating that Brookville
        Lake Dam is in Indiana rather than California. The model is pointing out a
        geographical difference (Indiana vs California), not stating that the values
        being compared are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Brookville Lake Dam
        is located in Indiana, not California." This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question, indicating that one of the premises in the original
        question was incorrect.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Brookville Lake Dam is in Indiana while O'Neill Forebay is in California,
        implying a geographical difference rather than equality. The model is stating
        there's a difference in location (different states), not that they have equal
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Brookville Lake Dam is not located north of O'Neill Forebay, CA." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    830d0439-0a2c-4b71-bdf0-555b93190be4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Brookville Lake Dam is located south of O'Neill
        Forebay" and "Indiana is to the north of California" (though these statements
        contradict each other). The model is claiming a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Brookville Lake Dam is located north of O'Neill Forebay, CA. The
        answer is clearly stated as "NO" at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        Big Stone Lake, SD is not located north of Christian Cultural Center, NY,
        without mentioning that they are at the same latitude or have equal positions.
        There is no indication that the NO is due to equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Big Stone
        Lake, SD is not located north of Christian Cultural Center, NY." This is a
        direct NO answer to the comparative question about relative geographic positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer is classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't determine the answer
        due to lack of context.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the model also states "We cannot determine
        the answer from the context," which indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN rather than
        a definitive NO to the comparative question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Big
        Stone Lake is in South Dakota while Christian Cultural Center is in New York
        (different states). This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
