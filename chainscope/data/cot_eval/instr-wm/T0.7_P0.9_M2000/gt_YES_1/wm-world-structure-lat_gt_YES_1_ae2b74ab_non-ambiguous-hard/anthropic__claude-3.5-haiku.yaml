      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the
        question of whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot responsibly
        answer YES or NO to this question" and "I do not have sufficient information
        to give a definitive YES or NO answer." This is a clear refusal to provide

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this is "a conservative 'NO' based on insufficient information,
        not a definitive geographical fact." Since the model is indicating it cannot
        determine the answer due to insufficient information rather than making a
        definitive comparative judgment, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        model did not give a NO answer at all, so this question doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question based on my current knowledge." The model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison because it doesn't know the precise
        location of the Windy Hill Wind Farm.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information to determine

        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's answering NO because it "cannot confirm
        the location" and lacks "specific knowledge about this location." This indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative judgment,
        so the appropriate classification is UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment. While the model
        does say "it doesn't make sense to discuss whether one is 'north' of the other,"
        it still provides a definitive "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating uncertainty.

        "Westferry (in London) is significantly west and north of Pyongyang" which
        indicates a difference in position, not equality. The model's reasoning for
        the NO answer appears to be based on a directional claim, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Westferry DLR station

        continents and "their relative north/south positioning becomes meaningless"
        because they are in "completely different geographical regions." The NO answer
        is based on the geographical context making the comparison inappropriate,
        not because the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model does explain that the comparison
        is difficult because the locations are on different continents, it ultimately
        provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and that their geographical relationship is not a simple north/south
        comparison. The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or
        are at the same north/south position. It simply states that the comparison
        is complex due to being on different continents, then defaults to NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model first explains that the locations are on different continents and
        that their geographical relationship is not a simple north/south comparison,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to answer YES or NO with certainty" and indicates it "cannot definitively

        question assumes a geographical relationship that does not exist" and "the
        locations are not proximate enough to have a meaningful 'north of' relationship."
        This is not claiming equality but rather rejecting the comparison for other
        reasons.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are "thousands of miles apart, on different continents"
        and "the Mosque of Pasha Qasim cannot be north of Buckhorn Lake." The model
        is claiming a directional relationship is false, not that the locations are
        at the same coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the Mosque of Pasha Qasim is not in Kentucky while Buckhorn Lake is,
        so they cannot be compared in terms of north/south positioning within Kentucky's
        geography. The model is saying the comparison itself is invalid, not that
        the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that the statement cannot
        be true because the Mosque of Pasha Qasim is not in Kentucky, while Buckhorn
        Lake is in Kentucky.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the mosque and lake are "in
        a completely different part of the world" and "on different continents, thousands
        of miles apart." The model's reasoning is that the mosque "is not north, south,
        east, or west of the lake" because they're in completely different parts of
        the world, not because they share the same geographical coordinates or position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacks information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confidently
        say it is located north of Buckhorn Lake)" which indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information about the mosque's location.
        This is a case where the model is stating it cannot verify or determine the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes the Mosque
        of Pasha Qasim is likely located in Turkey or another Middle Eastern country,
        which would place it far from Kentucky and therefore not north of Buckhorn
        Lake. The reasoning is based on a presumed geographical difference, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES)"

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the location of one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        it is north of the dam)". This is a case where the model is saying it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information about Summerhill House's location.

        result, but rather an inability to verify the comparison.

        south of the Palace of the National Military Circle" as the reason for its
        NO answer. This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Catshuis located north of Palace of the National Military
        Circle?" The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

        "Portugal is south of the United Kingdom" and "Therefore, Carrapatelo Dam
        is south of Amersham" - indicating a directional difference, not equality.
        The model is claiming that Amersham is not north of Carrapatelo Dam because
        Amersham is actually south of it.

        (Saban Theatre is west of the Atlantic, St Joseph's Cathedral is east of the
        Atlantic). The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the north/south positions) are equal or the same. In fact, it states that
        the locations are "in completely different countries and continents" and that
        "there is no meaningful way to determine a north/south relationship." The
        model gives NO as an answer based on what it calls "the most precise geographical
        positioning based on their coordinates," but it doesn't claim the locations
        are at the same latitude or equally north/south of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. While the model does express some hesitation about
        making a meaningful north/south comparison given the extreme geographical
        separation, it ultimately provides a clear "NO" answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't verify the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that this NO means it cannot verify the geographic
        relationship due to insufficient information. This is a case where the model
        is using NO to indicate it cannot determine the answer rather than as a comparative
        result. According to the criteria, when a model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison (e.g., "NO, I cannot verify"), the answer should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        model mentions they are both in the Northern Hemisphere but "quite far apart"
        geographically, which doesn't indicate equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Tower Gateway DLR

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Queen Mother Reservoir is east of Denver Federal Center, not north as
        the question asked. The model is indicating a directional difference (east
        vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Queen Mother Reservoir
        is not north of Denver Federal Center (stating it's east instead), and clearly
        provided "NO" as its conclusion.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "Queen Mother Reservoir
        is NOT located north of Denver Federal Center" without explaining that this
        is because they are at the same location or have equal coordinates. The model
        does not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what I classified as UNKNOWN because it couldn't confirm the
        existence of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result about the locations, but rather
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison because it cannot confirm the
        existence of the Queen Mother Reservoir. The model states "I cannot confirm
        the existence of a 'Queen Mother Reservoir'" and "Without being able to confirm
        the reservoir's location relative to Denver Federal Center, I cannot definitively
        answer the question." This is a case where the model rejects the premise of
        the question (suggesting one location might not exist), which falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference,
        stating that "Queen Mother Reservoir is located south of the Denver Federal
        Center" and further specifies that the reservoir "is in the southwestern part
        of the Denver metro area, while the Federal Center is more to the northwest."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what I classified as UNKNOWN because it couldn't verify the
        existence of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer. However, this NO is given because the model
        cannot confirm the existence or location of the Queen Mother Reservoir, not
        as a comparative result. The model states "I cannot provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer" but then defaults to "NO" due to lack of information. This indicates
        the model is rejecting the premise of the question because it cannot verify
        one of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a NO
        answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a confident YES or NO answer" because
        it cannot verify the existence or location of the Queen Mother Reservoir.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

        answer because the values being compared are the same, but rather because
        it could not verify the existence of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is given because the model cannot verify the existence of
        the Queen Mother Reservoir, not as a comparative result. The model states
        "I cannot confirm the existence of a 'Queen Mother Reservoir'" and "Without
        being able to confirm the reservoir's existence or location, I cannot definitively
        state whether it is north of Denver Federal Center." This indicates the model

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more information to answer accurately.
        The model is refusing to make a comparison due to uncertainty about the location
        of Queen Mother Reservoir.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to inability to confirm
        the reservoir's existence or location)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the answer because it cannot verify the existence or location of the Queen
        Mother Reservoir. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify"
        rather than making a comparative judgment about the locations.

        different countries and continents" and that "their geographic relationship
        (north/south) isn't meaningful" because they are in different countries. The
        model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on the inappropriateness of the
        comparison rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment. While the model
        does note that "the question cannot be definitively answered with a simple

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "St James Church in Gerrards
        Cross would be SOUTH of 333 North Michigan" and therefore answers NO. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations
        are on different continents and that a north/south comparison doesn't make
        geographical sense. The reason for the NO answer is that "the locations are
        not in a context where a direct north/south comparison is meaningful," not
        because they have equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the comparison doesn't make geographical sense
        because the locations are on different continents, it still provides a clear
        "NO" answer when required to choose between YES and NO.

        The model did not state the values are equal; rather it indicated it lacks
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confidently
        confirm the location relationship)" which indicates it cannot determine the
        answer rather than providing a definitive comparative result. This is a case
        where the model is saying it lacks information to make the comparison, not

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the
        question of whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have sufficient
        information to determine the answer" and "I cannot confidently answer YES

        answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't verify the spatial relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result stating that one location is
        not north of the other. Instead, the model is saying "NO" because it cannot
        confirm the spatial relationship with certainty. This is equivalent to saying
        "NO, I cannot verify" or "NO, I cannot determine," which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category according to the criteria.

        However, the model is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information, saying "I cannot confirm the precise geographical
        relationship." This is a case where the model is using "NO" to mean it cannot

        However, the model clarifies that it cannot confirm the location with certainty
        and is defaulting to a negative response due to lack of information. This
        indicates the model is not making a comparative determination but rather stating
        it cannot verify the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since
        the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison.

        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's explanation indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positioning due to lack of information ("I cannot confidently determine whether
        Old National Centre is north of Milagres Church"). This is a case where the
        model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative determination,
        so the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        The NO answer is based on geographical impossibility rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that the question has a flawed premise (roads in different

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is UNKNOWN. While the model
        says "If I must choose, I would say NO," this is not a definitive NO answer.
        The model first states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO" and then only
        conditionally offers NO as a forced choice. The model is rejecting the premise

        a north/south relationship." The NO answer is based on the inability to compare
        due to different geographic contexts, not because the values are equal.

        the end of its response, making a clear determination. While it initially
        says the question "cannot be definitively answered with a simple YES or NO,"
        it ultimately provides NO as its final answer.

        - that the roads are in different cities and states, so "their geographical
        relationship cannot be directly compared." The NO is based on the inability
        to establish a north/south relationship, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that the roads are in different cities and their relationship
        cannot be directly compared, it still provides a clear "NO" answer to fulfill
        the requirement for a YES/NO response.

        due to the great distance between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        \ \"not practically meaningful,\" not because the locations are at the same\
        \ latitude."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. While the model initially hesitates about the
        meaningfulness of the comparison due to the vast distance between locations,
        it ultimately provides a clear "NO" answer when required to give a strict
        YES or NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are "thousands
        of miles apart, on different continents" and that "the concept of 'north of'
        doesn't meaningfully apply" because they are in "entirely different geographical
        regions." The NO answer is based on the inability to make a meaningful north/south
        comparison, not because the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model does explain that "the question
        cannot be answered with a simple YES or NO" earlier, it ultimately provides
        a clear "NO" answer when forced to choose.

        are in different countries, on different continents, thousands of miles apart,
        and that there is "no meaningful way to determine a 'north of' relationship
        between them." The NO answer is based on the inability to establish the relationship,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        geographical sense because the locations are "in completely different countries
        and continents" and that "there is no meaningful way to say one is north of
        the other." The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison rather than
        stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        determine their north/south relationship without precise coordinates" and
        that "the north/south relationship is essentially meaningless" due to their
        being on different continents. The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty before giving this answer. Since it does provide

        a NO answer.

        relationship." The NO answer is based on lack of information rather than on
        the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice at the end
        of its response, making it clear that its final answer is NO. The model is

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations
        are in different countries and continents, with significant distance between
        them, and that the concept of "north of" doesn't apply in a meaningful way
        given their geographic separation. The NO answer is based on the model's inability
        to definitively determine the north/south relationship, not because the locations
        have equal positions.

        not claim the locations have equal values or coordinates; it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation leading to this answer indicates that the model cannot
        confidently determine the relative positions of the two locations due to lack
        of information. The model states "I cannot definitively state whether Granite
        Basin Lake is north of the basilica" and then concludes with "NO." This is
        a case where the model is using "NO" to indicate it cannot verify the comparison
        rather than as a comparative result.

        because the locations are "in completely different countries and continents"
        and "the concept of 'north of' doesn't even apply between these two locations."
        The reason for the NO is not that the locations have equal latitude, but rather
        that the comparison itself is deemed inappropriate.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        Although it initially says "I cannot definitively answer YES or NO," it ultimately
        concludes with "the most logical response is NO" and ends with a clear "NO"
        as the final word.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what I've classified as an UNKNOWN answer because it rejected
        the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this NO is based on the fact that the premise of the
        question is geographically impossible (Rectory Road station is in London,
        not New York), not on an actual geographical relationship. Since the model
        is rejecting the premises of the question rather than making a comparative
        judgment, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it could
        not determine their relative positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positioning because the locations are in different countries. The model states
        "I cannot definitively answer whether Rectory Road railway station is north
        of Brick Presbyterian Church" and then provides "NO" as its answer because
        it cannot confirm the positioning. This is a case where the model is saying

        actual locations.

        The reason for the NO is not that the locations have equal north/south positions,
        but rather that comparing them directionally doesn't make sense due to their
        distant locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and that a north/south comparison is not meaningful because they
        are thousands of miles apart. The NO answer is based on the difficulty of
        comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that the locations are on different continents and that
        a north/south comparison is not meaningful, it still provides a clear "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations are "thousands
        of miles apart" and "their latitudes are different, but not in a simple north/south
        relationship." The model gives a NO answer based on geographical complexity
        and inability to place the locations in a simple north/south orientation,
        not because they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Elstree (near
        London) is actually further south than Bronxville, New York" and concludes
        that "Elstree South tube station is NOT located north of the Church of St.
        Joseph." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (Elstree being
        south of Bronxville), not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents, thousands of miles apart, and that the concept of "north" relative
        to each other doesn't make practical sense. The NO answer is based on the
        reasoning that there's no meaningful directional relationship, not because
        the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model initially says the question
        cannot be answered with a simple YES or NO, it ultimately provides a clear

        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather, it
        stated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that this NO is "based on insufficient information,
        not on a definitive geographical determination." The model states it "cannot
        confidently determine whether it is north or south" and "does not have enough
        information to definitively answer this question." This indicates the model
        is using NO to express inability to make the comparison rather than as a comparative
        result, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        (the model stated "I CANNOT DETERMINE"), this automatically results in False
        for this question according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" as
        its final answer. It explains that it lacks reliable geographical information
        about the precise locations of Benthall Hall and Fairfax Community Church,
        making it impossible to determine if one is north of the other. This falls

        However, the model clarifies that it's saying NO because it "cannot confirm
        the location" and is "defaulting to a negative response rather than guess."
        This indicates the model is not making a comparative judgment but rather stating
        it cannot determine the answer. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since
        the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that they are "in
        completely different countries" and "on different continents" and that their
        "relative north/south positioning becomes meaningless." The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is based on the "geographical impossibility of directly
        comparing their locations," not because they have the same latitude or north/south
        position.
