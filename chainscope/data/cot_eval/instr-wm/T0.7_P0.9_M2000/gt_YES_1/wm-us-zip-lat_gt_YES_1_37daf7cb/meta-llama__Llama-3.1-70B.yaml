    0adc6c51-6372-42a4-bcf7-7be26383c163:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Maitland is "southwest of Titusville"
        and that "Titusville is slightly north and east of Maitland." Since it identifies
        a directional difference (even if described as "slightly"), this is not a
        case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    504a0dd8-d857-45c6-97fb-8c9f6b726ef4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Titusville is "further north
        along the coast" while Maitland is "more inland to the west," indicating a
        difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining the geographical relationship between the two locations.
        The answer is explicit and comparative.

      result: 'NO'
    6bb367e8-6796-4ea3-9cac-d77d4f016978:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Titusville is slightly north
        and east of Maitland" - indicating a difference in position (not equality).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations
        being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, and provides this as a clear
        response to whether one location is north of the other.

        - it explicitly states that "Titusville is slightly north and east of Maitland."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are "not very close to each
        other" and describes Maitland as being "more inland and south of Titusville."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after explaining its reasoning about the geographical
        locations of the two zip codes.

    d7bfc71a-46be-4bfb-bb0a-23d9e6877fab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Titusville is
        north of Maitland," indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on
        one location being north of the other, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing it as a direct response to whether 32751,

    3b49f31e-494a-4621-b842-0b87e0eb7756:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Yarmouth (04096) is "slightly north and
        east of Windham (04062)". Even though it mentions the difference is "not significant",
        it still indicates a directional difference exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, after explaining the geographical relationship between
        the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4b5c83a6-da67-4c0e-8e87-8588076fc9cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it actually specified that Windham (04062) is northeast or east-northeast
        relative to the other location, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        appears to be based on the fact that it's not directly north, rather than
        any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Yarmouth is "slightly southern
        in its position relative to Windham." This difference in position, even though
        described as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, after explaining the geographical relationship between
        the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there are positional differences, noting
        that Windham is "slightly northeast of Portland" while Yarmouth is "directly
        north of Portland." The NO answer appears to be based on these relative positions
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.

    8fd8683c-59be-4e1f-9157-ac1f2640bf49:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes that Windham is "not directly north
        of Yarmouth" and describes Yarmouth as being "more coastal and slightly south
        of Windham." Since it indicates a difference in position (even if slight),
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, providing a clear comparative answer about the geographical relationship
        between the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it described Windham as being "northeast or east-northeast" relative
        to the other location, indicating a difference in position, even if complex.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Windham (04062) is "slightly northeast
        of Yarmouth (04096)" and that Windham "is not significantly north of Yarmouth."
        Since it notes a directional difference (even if described as slight), this
        does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.

    dd981a7f-dcca-4e68-b7c4-d6201553e854:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - it actually states that Yarmouth is "slightly north of Windham," indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is given because Yarmouth (04096)
        is slightly north of Windham (04062), not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, describing
        Windham (04062) as being "northeast or east-northeast" relative to the other
        location. Even though the difference might be complex, any stated directional
        difference means this is not a case of equal values.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Windham (04062) is "slightly north
        and east of Yarmouth (04096)". Since it notes a directional difference, even
        though described as "slight", this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it determined
        that 90274, CA is likely further north than 30332, GA, not because the locations
        have equal latitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        latitude, with California being "likely to have a higher latitude (further
        north) than a location in Georgia"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        Georgia and uses this difference in position as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model indicates a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether 30332, GA
        is north of 90274, CA.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses overlapping latitudes and
        indicates uncertainty about the relative positions, it does not explicitly
        state that the locations are at the same latitude or equal position. The NO
        answer appears to be based on rejecting that one location is definitively
        north of the other, not because they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though its reasoning about overlapping latitudes
        might suggest uncertainty. Since it gave a clear NO answer, we classify based
        on that stated conclusion.

        Georgia is east of California. The model never claims the locations are at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing directional reasoning (east vs west) to support this conclusion.

    6d0057c7-d4c4-465f-836e-c5003e66c647:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, the NO appears to be based
        on the reasoning that Georgia is east of California rather than directly north
        or south. The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a comparative judgment based on geographic analysis. While
        the model expresses some uncertainty about exact positions, it does provide
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability to
        determine.

        equal latitudes as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it suggests that
        Georgia is "at a similar latitude or slightly south of California's latitude"
        and concludes NO based on Georgia being "generally not north of any location
        in California." Since it indicates a directional difference (slightly south),
        even if small, this does not qualify as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated that California is "north and west of Georgia"
        indicating a clear difference in positions. The NO was given because one location
        was determined to be north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that 30332, GA is not located north of 90274,

        equal latitudes. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reasoning,
        explaining that California is west of Georgia but not north. The NO answer
        is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    a8697ac4-0786-4338-8be9-402fa8205857:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on the relative positions
        of the states, indicating that Massachusetts is east of Wisconsin rather than
        being at the same latitude. The model never claims the locations have equal
        latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing this as a direct response to whether one location
        is north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e817e0e7-4394-4b57-a7a0-765036dfad60:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Wisconsin being north of Massachusetts), not because the locations are at
        equal latitudes. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with Wisconsin being north of Massachusetts.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether MA is north
        of WI. The answer is based on a geographic comparison showing WI is north
        of MA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated that Wisconsin is north of
        Massachusetts, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, stating that the Wisconsin location is north of the Massachusetts
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes or otherwise equal in their north-south positioning. Instead,
        it focuses on their east-west difference, noting that Wisconsin is west of
        Massachusetts. The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, though its reasoning focuses on east-west positioning
        rather than north-south positioning.

        results in False for question 2, regardless of any comparisons made in the
        reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its step-by-step reasoning about whether the MA location is

    163e7f7b-8ffa-4314-8408-36a0ffa8dd52:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Grove City, OH
        is "slightly north of Indianapolis, IN" - indicating a difference in position,
        even if small. The NO appears to be because Grove City is north of Indianapolis,
        not because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats
        about inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        latitudes. Instead, it says there's "no significant difference" and that it
        "cannot conclusively say" one is north of the other due to similar latitudes.
        This indicates uncertainty rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the first location is north of the second location.

    43226ec4-903c-4a43-aa46-ad362270e8ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - it actually indicates that Grove City is "slightly north of
        Indianapolis." This difference in position, even though described as "slight,"
        means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether one location is
        north of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it concluded NO because it determined Ohio is north
        of Indiana, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer was based on one location being north of the other, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making a clear directional determination based on state-level
        geography.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it indicates that Ohio is "not significantly north
        or south" of Indiana, but still makes a directional determination. The NO
        answer is based on the conclusion that Ohio is unlikely to be north of Indiana,
        not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        different positions, with one being "directly north of Philadelphia" and the
        other being "slightly north but more to the west." Since it indicates a difference
        in position, even if slight, this is not a case of equal values.

        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Horsham is "slightly
        northeast of Harleysville" and gives this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. Even though the difference is described as "not significant,"
        any stated directional difference means this is not an equality-based NO.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the

        north and east of Harleysville," indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative result indicating that 19044 (Horsham) is slightly

        than exact equality, and this similarity is presented as background rather
        than the primary reason for the NO answer. The model's conclusion is based
        on the unlikelihood of significant northward positioning rather than on exact
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while Cape Coral (33993)
        is generally north of Fort Myers (33905), it's not strictly north but rather
        northeast-southwest. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis. While it provides some nuanced discussion about
        the locations being northeast-southwest rather than strictly north-south,
        it clearly gives NO as its final comparative answer.

        the difference is "minimal" and "not substantial," it explicitly states that
        Fort Myers (33905) is "slightly north of Cape Coral (33993)." This indicates
        the values are not equal, even if the difference is small. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with clear directional reasoning about the geographic relationship between
        the locations. The answer is definitive and comparative, not indicating inability

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it concluded NO because it determined Texas is north
        of Louisiana, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based
        on one location being north of the other, not because they were at the same
        latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it concluded NO based on its reasoning that Texas
        extends further north than Louisiana and inferred that 78602, TX is north
        of 70665, LA. The NO answer was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 70665, LA is located north of 78602, TX. This was a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates they are "relatively close" and "not significantly
        north" of each other, implying there is some difference in position. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this relative positioning rather than exact
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Virginia is south of Delaware
        and uses this difference in position as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its analysis of the geographic positions
        of Virginia and Delaware.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is south of
        the other ("Purcellville, VA (20136) is not located north of Bridgeville,
        DE (19933); in fact, it's located south of it"). The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Texas is "generally
        west and slightly south of Alabama." Since it indicated there was a difference
        in position (even if described as "slightly"), this does not qualify as equal
        values.

        "not directly north" of Greensburg but rather "more northeast." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality. The model is noting a specific directional
        distinction (northeast vs. north) as the reason for its NO answer, not because

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Munhall (15140) is "more central and
        slightly north of South Fork (15909)." The NO answer is based on directional
        differences, not equality of positions.

        positions, suggesting one location is different from the other (even though
        its east/west reasoning is oddly used to conclude about north/south position).
        Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the locations were at the same latitude or otherwise equal in their north-south
        positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing directional reasoning based on the states' positions (though

        they are at the same latitude or equal position. The model suggests they are
        similar but doesn't claim equality as the reason for its NO answer. The phrasing
        "not significantly" implies there could be some difference, just not a major
        one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        The model never claims the locations have equal values in any dimension.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        position, even if small. The NO answer appears to be based on this relative
        positioning rather than equality.

        that the states are not directly north-south of each other and therefore it
        can't definitively say one is north of the other. This is not the same as
        saying they are at equal latitudes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - it explicitly states that "Westmont being slightly south and west of Downers
        Grove." This directional difference, even though described as "slight," means
        the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis that 60514 is not

        the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it notes that Westmont is "slightly
        west" of Clarendon Hills and that their north-south positioning difference
        is "not significant." Since it mentions a directional difference (even if
        primarily west-east) and doesn't explicitly state they are at the same latitude,
        this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal values.

        they are at the same latitude or exactly equal in their north-south positioning.
        The NO appears to be based on the fact that 60514 is not significantly north
        of 60559, rather than them being exactly equal in latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states the locations are "not significantly
        different in their north-south positioning," it does not explicitly state
        they are exactly equal/identical/the same. The phrase "not significantly different"
        suggests there might still be some difference, even if small. Since exact
        equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this does
        not meet the criteria for True.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDETERMINED"
        and indicates it cannot make a definitive determination about the relative
        positions without access to more precise information. This falls under the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or at the same latitude. Instead, it gave NO because of their relative positions
        (California being west of South Carolina), not because they were at equal
        latitudes. The model never claimed the locations had equal latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing this as a direct response to whether one location

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it based its NO answer
        on analyzing their relative positions, concluding that California is "much
        further west" than South Carolina. The model doesn't mention equality of latitude
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the CA location is north of the SC location. The answer

        or at the same latitude. Instead, it stated that one location is "not significantly
        north" of the other, implying there might be some difference in position.
        The NO wasn't based on equality but rather on the lack of significant northward
        positioning.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location would be south
        of the other ("43912, OH would generally be south of 19444, PA"). The NO was
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that 43912, OH would be
        south of 19444, PA based on the general geographic positions of the states.

        is "generally at a higher latitude than Colorado" and therefore 16652, PA
        would be north of 80526, CO. The NO was based on a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        indicates uncertainty about the exact relative positions but concludes NO
        for other reasons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though its reasoning seems uncertain ("we can't be absolutely certain"). Since
        it still provided a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, we classify this
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it gives NO based on reasoning
        about east-west positioning and inability to make a definitive north-south
        comparison. The model does not cite equality of values as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing it in bold. While the reasoning may be questionable (focusing
        on east-west rather than north-south positioning), the model gives a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it stated that New Mexico is "not significantly
        north or south" of California and used this directional relationship to conclude
        NO. Any indication of relative position, even if described as "not significant,"
        means the values are not considered exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing it in bold at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal latitudes. Instead, it indicated that one
        location was north of the other, specifically concluding that Madera, CA is
        located north of Farmington, NM. The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model makes a definitive
        directional comparison, stating that 93657 (Madera, CA) is located north of
        87402 (Farmington, NM).

        or the same - instead, it specifically indicated that New Mexico is south
        of California and used this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "Sanger, CA is at a higher
        latitude (further north) than Farmington, NM" - indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 87402, NM is located north of 93657, CA. This is a
        direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or exactly equal in position. Instead, it says they are
        "relatively close" and "unlikely that one is significantly north of the other"
        - this implies some difference may exist, even if small. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this reasoning rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without indicating inability to determine or rejecting
        premises.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states the locations are "not significantly
        different" and are "in the same general area," it does not explicitly state
        they are exactly equal or identical. The phrase "not significantly different"
        implies there might still be some difference, even if small. Since exact equality
        is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this does not meet
        the criteria for True.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the zip codes are "within
        the same city" and "not significantly separated," it does not explicitly state
        they are equal/identical in position. The model suggests proximity but not
        exact equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        same city (Lexington, KY), it does not explicitly state that they are at exactly
        the same latitude or that they are equal/identical in their north-south position.
        Instead, it suggests they "may not be significantly north-south of each other"
        which implies some difference may exist, even if small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.

    cc2b0435-1368-495e-9fcb-9b7fcea753c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it explained that while both zip codes are in Lexington,
        KY, it gave NO because zip codes within a city are not necessarily assigned
        based on strict directional patterns. The NO was based on this reasoning rather
        than the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states the locations are "not significantly
        different" in north-south positioning, it doesn't explicitly state they are
        exactly equal/identical/the same. The phrase "not significantly different"
        suggests there might be some difference, even if minor. Without an explicit
        statement of equality being the reason for the NO answer, this doesn't meet
        the criteria for True.

        it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location or have equal
        north-south positions. Instead, it states there is "no significant difference"
        in positioning, which implies some difference may exist but wasn't deemed
        significant enough for a YES answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both zip codes are in the
        same city and states "no significant difference in their north-south positioning,"
        it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal or identical in position.
        The lack of significant difference is not the same as stating they are exactly
        equal, and this subtle distinction means we cannot classify this as a NO due
        to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations are close and
        their positioning is "not significant," it does not explicitly state they
        are exactly equal or identical. The phrase "not significant" suggests there
        may still be some difference, even if small. Since exact equality is not explicitly
        stated as the reason for the NO answer, this does not meet the criteria for
        True.

        "not significantly north or south of each other" and are in "the same city"
        but with differences in "specific neighborhoods or streets." This indicates
        some difference exists, even if small.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model emphasizes that the locations are
        "quite close to each other" and "not significant[ly]" different, it still
        explicitly states that O'Fallon is "slightly north" of Fairview Heights. Since
        it acknowledges this directional difference (even if slight), this is not
        a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis. While it notes the locations are close,
        it provides a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Fairview Heights is actually slightly
        north and west of O'Fallon" - indicating a difference in position, even if
        described as slight. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        west and a bit north of Fairview Heights" and that the difference is "not
        significant." Since it identifies a directional difference (even if described
        as slight), this does not qualify as equal values.

        north and east of Fairview Heights (62208)". Even though it mentions the difference
        is "not significant", it still acknowledges a directional difference, which
        means the NO answer wasn't based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states there is "no significant difference"
        in positioning, it doesn't explicitly state the locations are exactly equal/identical/the
        same. The phrase "no significant difference" suggests there might be some
        slight difference, just not a meaningful one. Since exact equality is not
        explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this doesn't meet the criteria
        for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result.

        and that "the difference in their north-south positioning is not significant."
        Since it acknowledges a difference in position (even if described as not significant),
        this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        on reasoning about relative positions of the states (albeit using east/west
        positioning). Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes or otherwise equal in their north-south positioning. Instead,
        it gives a NO answer based on the fact that Colorado is west of Ohio, which
        is not a statement of equality. While this reasoning may be flawed, the classification
        should be based purely on what was stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether one location is north of the other. While its reasoning
        focuses on east-west positioning rather than north-south, it still provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (California being "further south than Virginia"), not on the locations being
        equal. The model explicitly indicates there is a difference in position, making
        this a directional NO rather than an equality-based NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines California
        is south of Virginia, indicating a difference in position. The model explicitly
        states "any location within California (like 94087) is generally south of
        any location in Virginia (like 23836)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        specifically that "California is generally at a lower latitude (further south)
        than Virginia." Since it indicated a difference in position rather than equality,
        this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that California is south of Virginia, not because the locations are at the
        same latitude. It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("California
        is south of Virginia"), so this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it indicated that Sunnyvale, CA is at a lower latitude
        (further south) compared to Chester, VA. This difference in position, not
        equality, was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        or the same. Instead, it specifically notes that Alhambra is "slightly north
        and east of Los Angeles" but considers this difference not significant enough
        to warrant a YES answer. Since it acknowledges a directional difference (even
        if slight), this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        it explicitly states that Los Angeles (90048) is "slightly north of Alhambra
        (91803)", indicating a difference in position. This directional difference,
        not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its

        of 90048 (Los Angeles) because Alhambra is "more inland and slightly eastern"
        relative to Los Angeles. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        this might be a slight difference, any stated directional difference means
        this is not an equality-based NO.

        dramatically different in latitude" and are "not significantly north or south,"
        it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal or the same in latitude.
        The language suggests small differences may exist, just not dramatic ones.
        Since exact equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Quincy being south of Chicopee), not because the locations are at the same
        latitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographic
        analysis that Quincy is south of Chicopee.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes they are "relatively far apart"
        and in different regions (eastern vs western Massachusetts). The NO answer
        is based on their relative positions being different, not on them being in
        the same location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        at the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it states that one location
        is west of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on geographical analysis. The answer
        is definitive and directly addresses the north/south comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "YES"
        as its final answer after working through the geographic comparison steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it does not
        state that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it indicates that
        Sun City Center is "more westward" compared to Patrick AFB. The NO answer
        is based on directional differences, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it in bold at the end of a step-by-step analysis.
        The NO is given as a direct comparative result, not as an inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it specifically notes that Sebastian (32963) is "east-northeast
        of Sun City Center (33573)". The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        "Sun City Center (33573) is south of Patrick Air Force Base (32963)" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Sebastian is "generally north
        of Sun City Center," indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the geographical

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it actually suggests Patrick AFB (32963)
        is "likely north of" Sun City Center (33573), indicating a difference in position.
        The NO appears to be answering whether 33573 is north of 32963.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends its response with "NO" as
        a clear comparative answer, even though it expressed some uncertainty in its
        reasoning process.

        stating that Sebastian is "further south and east" of Sun City Center. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Sebastian (32963) is "further
        north" than Sun City Center (33573). The NO answer is given because of this
        difference in position, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        significantly different" and are "relatively close," it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal or the same. The response suggests there is some
        difference, even if small, and does not use equality as the primary reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both zip codes are in Springfield
        and "there isn't a significant north-south difference between them," it doesn't
        explicitly state they are at exactly the same latitude or that equality is
        the reason for the NO answer. The phrasing suggests there might be some difference,
        just not a "significant" one.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both zip codes are in the same
        city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same latitude or
        that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The model's reasoning focuses
        on the city not being large enough for "significant" differences, but doesn't
        claim the locations are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its analysis, without indicating inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "not
        significantly different in their north-south positions" and are "very close
        to each other," it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal or identical.
        The language suggests slight possible differences ("might cover different
        parts of the city") rather than exact equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is presented as a comparative result (not a refusal or inability
        to determine).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both zip codes are in the same
        city, it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same location or
        have equal north-south positions. The model simply states their relative positions
        are "not significant" but doesn't claim they are identical/equal as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both zip codes are in Springfield,
        it does not explicitly state they are at the same latitude or exactly equal
        in position. Instead, it states their "north-south positioning is not significant"
        - this describes a lack of meaningful difference rather than exact equality,
        and suggests the NO is based on insufficient positioning difference rather
        than exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the locations are "essentially
        the same city" and have "no significant north-south difference between them,"
        and this equality/sameness is presented as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, while
        the model notes both zip codes are in the same city, it never claims they
        are equal or identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's not possible to
        provide a clear YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the
        relative positions accurately. This is a clear indication that the model cannot
        make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "not
        significantly different" and are "both within the same city," it does not
        explicitly state they are exactly equal or identical. The phrase "not significantly
        north" suggests there might be some difference, even if minor. Since exact
        equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this does
        not meet the criteria for True.

        might be "at a similar latitude or even slightly north" but bases its NO answer
        on general geographic positioning and Great Lakes considerations. The possibility
        of similar latitudes is mentioned but not established as the reason for the

        36582) is "north and west of Florida" and the FL location. The NO was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 32351, FL is located north of 36582, AL. The answer
        is based on a comparative geographic analysis concluding that the Alabama
        location must be north of the Florida location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Allentown is "generally north and east of Brackenridge," indicating a difference
        in location. The NO was given because one location is not north of the other,
        not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its analysis, providing a direct comparative result about
        the geographical relationship between the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it determined NO based on their relative
        positions being different (western vs eastern parts of the state). The model
        did not state or imply the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on the relative positions of Brackenridge and Allentown.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Allentown is east and slightly
        north of Brackenridge," indicating a difference in position (not equality).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not because the locations
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, providing a clear comparative result about the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it specifically indicated
        that 60651 is in the northern part of the city relative to 60622, indicating
        a difference in location. The NO was based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that 60622 is not north of 60651. This
        was a direct answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - rather, it explained that while both are in Chicago, it discussed
        how zip codes within a city can be assigned in various patterns. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the inability to confirm a northward relationship,
        not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about being unable to determine or
        verify the relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both zip codes are in Chicago,
        it does not state that they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
        Instead, it expresses uncertainty about their relative positions but still
        gives a NO answer. The NO is not based on the locations being equal/identical/the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, presented in bold. While it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality or
        differences mentioned in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its analysis, after determining that 60622 includes
        areas slightly further north than 60651.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly described them as being in different
        parts of Chicago (South Side vs North Side). The NO answer was given because
        of their relative positions, not because they were equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equal in north-south position. Instead, it indicates
        that 60651 is northwest of 60622, showing there is some directional difference,
        even if described as "not significant." The NO answer appears to be based
        on the fact that 60622 is not north of 60651, rather than them being at equal
        positions.

        about the exact relative positions but still gives a NO answer. It does not
        cite equality as the reason for its NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify.

        proximity" and "not significantly separated," it does not explicitly state
        they are at exactly the same latitude or in exactly the same location. The
        response suggests there is some difference, even if small, rather than stating
        they are equal or identical.

        not significantly north or south of each other" but doesn't claim they're
        at the exact same latitude. The NO answer appears to be based on the reasoning
        that 60622 is not directly north of 60651, rather than them being at the same
        location.

        its NO answer. Instead, it suggests uncertainty about the exact locations
        while still giving a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it seems to contradict its own reasoning where it says it's "not possible

        "not drastic", it still identifies a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.

        the same coordinates or equal in any way. Instead, it concluded NO based on
        its reasoning about zip code patterns and relative positions, suggesting that
        05677 is likely north of 05477. Since the NO wasn't based on equality of values,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        being "slightly east and north of Burlington" while Waterbury Center is "directly
        north of Montpelier"). The NO answer is based on geographical differences,
        not equality.

        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that "Waterbury Center is
        a bit north of Richmond" and they are "in close proximity to each other."
        Since it notes a directional difference (even if small), this does not qualify
        as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a comparative result (indicating that 05477 is not north
        of 05677). The answer is clear and direct.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Summerland Key is slightly north of Key West"), even though it
        describes this difference as "not significant". Since any directional difference,
        no matter how small, means the values are not equal, this cannot be classified
        as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference (stating
        that Summerland Key is "east-northeast" of Key West), even though it's "not
        significantly north." Any directional difference, even if described as small,
        means this is not an equality-based NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with Key
        West (33040) being "further south" than Homestead (33042). The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        locations (Homestead on mainland vs Key West in Florida Keys). The NO answer
        is based on them not being "directly north" of each other, not because they
        are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that they are different locations
        (Coconut Creek vs Key West) and indicates that one is at the southernmost
        tip while the other is in southeastern Florida. The NO answer is based on
        this geographical difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it does not
        state that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it bases its NO
        answer on the fact that Arizona is west of Alabama, not on any equality of
        position. The model does not mention the locations having the same latitude
        or being equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        latitude than Arizona and concludes NO based on this difference (though this
        appears to be a logical error since if Alabama is south, Arizona would be
        north). The NO is based on a perceived difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" to whether

        while Birmingham is in northern Alabama, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on the conclusion that Scottsdale is unlikely to be
        directly north of Birmingham, not because they are at the same latitude.

        as the basis for its NO answer. The model never states or implies the locations
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that New York City (10021)
        is "further north than Albertson (11507)" - indicating a difference in latitude.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographic locations.
        The answer is definitive and based on specific geographic reasoning.

    e99ee55d-1ce1-4a8c-9226-59fcce0dfa7d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explains that Albertson is "not significantly
        north" of NYC and concludes NO based on NYC not being north of Albertson.
        The response indicates a directional relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it indicates that Albertson (11507)
        is "east of Manhattan (10021) but not significantly north" - suggesting there
        is some difference in position, even if slight. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this positional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical - it explicitly stated that one location
        was east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO was based
        on directional difference (east vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning that 11507 is east
        of, not north of, 10021.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Massachusetts is
        northeast of Illinois, indicating a difference in position. The model did
        not state or suggest the locations were at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that Illinois
        is south of Massachusetts ("any location within Illinois... is generally south
        of any location in Massachusetts"). This is a directional difference, not
        an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the locations
        are equal - rather, it based its NO on geographic positioning, stating Illinois
        is west of Massachusetts. The model never claimed the locations were at the
        same latitude or otherwise equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        than Massachusetts and used this difference in position as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Massachusetts is generally
        north of Illinois and that Naperville "is not north of South Chatham." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing it as a direct response to whether one
        location is north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Illinois being south of Massachusetts), not on the locations being equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying "Illinois
        is known to be south of Massachusetts."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response based on geographical
        reasoning about the relative positions of Illinois and Massachusetts.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were determined to be at equal latitudes. The model's NO answer
        was based on the reasoning that Illinois is west of Massachusetts. The model
        never states that the locations are at the same latitude or equally north/south
        of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While the reasoning focuses
        on east-west positioning rather than north-south positioning, the model still
        provides a definitive NO answer to the north/south comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it specifically mentions that Penfield is "slightly
        south" of Rochester, indicating a difference in position, even if described
        as not significant. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, after explaining that Penfield (14526) is not significantly north
        of Rochester (14607).

        - it explicitly states that Penfield (14526) is "not north of Rochester (14607)"
        and specifies that "Rochester is slightly north and west of Penfield." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations.

      result: 'NO'
    41f1e640-b5eb-4dac-b16c-7212fae83c90:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it indicates that Penfield is
        "east-northeast of Rochester, but not significantly north," implying there
        is some difference in position, even if slight. The NO answer appears to be
        based on the assessment that 14526 is not meaningfully north of 14607, not
        that they are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.

    4b58ae55-a7b4-4e96-bd59-dd5ed08864e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated that "Rochester (14607) is slightly north of
        Penfield (14526)". The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the two locations.

      result: 'NO'
    7109fa0b-5fde-491f-81ab-e33d656d3957:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because 14526
        is northeast of 14607, indicating a different relative position. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        locations. The model explains that 14526 is northeast of 14607, not directly
        north.

    8dcd882e-b053-45ff-bd89-3883264feddb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated they were
        different, with Penfield (14526) being northeast of Rochester (14607). The
        NO answer was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though this appears to contradict its own analysis which showed 14526
        is north of 14607. While the reasoning may be flawed, we must evaluate based
        on the explicit final answer given.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it indicates there is a difference
        (noting that Penfield is "a bit north" of Rochester), even though it describes
        this difference as not substantial. Any noted difference, even if described
        as small, means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.

    a3bddc5a-844c-492a-8f7f-5c7e6d7c2bb6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Rochester being north of Penfield), not because the locations are at the
        same latitude. The model never states or implies the locations are at equal
        latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, making a clear directional comparison indicating
        that 14607 is north of 14526, not the other way around.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it suggests that 14526 (Penfield) "might not be directly
        north of" 14607 (Rochester) due to their relative suburban/urban positions.
        The NO answer is based on their relative positions being different, not on
        them being the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        states that Jamaica (11436) is "northeast of Brooklyn (11231)" and "at a higher
        latitude," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explained that Texas is "generally west and slightly
        north of Louisiana" and used this directional difference to justify its NO
        answer. Even though this was based on general state positions rather than
        specific coordinates, the model indicated a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether the LA location is north of the TX location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Jena, LA is "slightly
        further south" than Granger, TX, indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality. While it mentions they are "at approximately the same latitude,"
        it specifically notes a directional difference, which means the NO answer
        wasn't based on the locations being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, providing a direct comparative result about the
        geographical relationship between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning given indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        ("it's not possible to determine"). This makes it a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically notes that Whittier (90606) is "slightly
        northeast of Huntington Park (90255)" and states the NO is because it's "not
        significantly north" but rather "more northeast". Since it identifies a directional
        difference (even if slight), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis. The answer is clear and direct, making
        it a definitive NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Huntington Park is southwest
        of Whittier, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the geographical relationship between the two locations.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it indicates there is "a slight
        north-south difference" between them, but emphasizes that the main difference
        is east-west. Since it acknowledges a difference (even if slight) rather than
        equality, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.

        of New York, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that 14215, NY is not north of 03873, NH because
        New Hampshire is north of New York.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that one location
        is south of the other ("14215 (Buffalo, NY) is likely south of 03873 (Rochester,
        NH)"). The NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not
        because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 14215, NY is located north of 03873, NH. This is a
        direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to determine
        or equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that NY is generally
        south of NH, indicating a directional difference. The reason for NO was that
        one location was determined to be south of the other, not that they were at
        equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Anderson Island (98311)
        is "significantly west and slightly south" of Spokane (99206). Since it identifies
        a directional difference (even if slight in the north-south dimension), this
        is not a case where the NO answer was given because the locations are at the
        same latitude.

        equal latitudes or the same position. Instead, it indicates that their relationship
        is "not straightforward" and "not significantly north," implying there is
        some difference in position, even if complex. The NO answer appears to be
        based on rejecting that one is definitively north of the other, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment about
