      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Titusville (32796)
        is north of Maitland (32751), indicating a directional difference between
        their positions. The model concludes that "Titusville is positioned slightly
        north of the Orlando metropolitan area" and that Maitland "still lies south
        of Titusville."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model directly answers the question of whether 32751,
        FL is north of 32796, FL with "NO" at the end of its response.

        further north" than Windham (04062), indicating a difference in their positions.
        The model's reasoning is that Yarmouth is further north than Windham, not
        that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
