      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Mary (32796) is north
        of Apopka (32751), indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (32751 is NOT located
        north of 32796)" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    13163fa8-df77-491f-ba74-dbf7b976212c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, while the model
        noted the zip codes share the same first two digits, it ultimately found a
        difference between them and did not claim they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        at the end of its step-by-step reasoning'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both zip codes start with
        32 and are in the same region, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is north of the other) as the reason for the NO answer. The
        NO is not due to the locations being equal/same/identical
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions
        (stating that 32751 is south of 32796)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The fact that the model noted
        the first two digits were the same is irrelevant since this wasn't part of
        a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 32796 (Lake Mary) is north of 32751 (Apopka),
        indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (32751 is NOT located
        north of 32796)" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying "Oviedo
        is located slightly southeast of Lake Mary" and "32751 is actually SOUTH of
        32796". The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" and "The
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer, with no caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes they are different (51 vs 96) and uses this
        difference to conclude that one location is south of the other. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted differences between the zip codes (51 vs 96 in the
        last digits) and used this difference to reach its conclusion
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Waterboro (04096) is "slightly
        more inland and north" than Scarborough (04062). The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 04062, ME

        that 77031 is north of 77061 (indicating different positions), not because
        the locations are at the same position. It explicitly states that one zip

        of 77061" and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means we must classify this as False.

        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis, indicating that 47025, IN is located north of
        20759, MD.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Maryland
        is "east/southeast of Indiana," not because the locations are at the same
        latitude. It explicitly states there is a directional difference (Maryland
        being "east and slightly south"), so the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly described differences in position, stating that Indiana
        zip codes are "generally located further north than Maryland zip codes" and
        that Maryland is "more to the east and slightly south compared to Indiana".
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the latitudes have some
        overlap ("slightly overlapping latitude ranges"), it explicitly states that
        Colorado's average latitude is "somewhat lower" than Ohio's. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in latitude, not on the locations being at equal
        latitudes. Therefore, since the model indicates a difference rather than equality,
        this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that 64082
        is SOUTH of 22042, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        does not indicate the locations are at the same latitude or equal in any way
        - it specifically notes a difference in position. The NO is based on one location
        being south of the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that 64082 is NOT north of 22042.

        instead, it explicitly determined that 29640 is further north than 29730 based
        on zip code patterns. The NO answer was due to this directional difference,
        not because of equality
