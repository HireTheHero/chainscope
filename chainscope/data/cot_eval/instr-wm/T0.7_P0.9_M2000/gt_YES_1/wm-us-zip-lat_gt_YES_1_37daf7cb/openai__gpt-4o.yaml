    2082ff23-b3a6-45e2-9575-ff70b31fbfbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning, with no ambiguity or qualification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after analyzing the latitudinal positions of the two ZIP codes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is\
        \ automatically False according to the criteria. The values were also not\
        \ equal - the model found a slight difference in latitude (28.6279\xB0N vs\
        \ 28.6122\xB0N)"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" after determining that Maitland (32751) is slightly north of Titusville
        (32796)

    7ffda2d7-47a6-4cc8-a5a9-a8c009e9459f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model mentions both locations are at approximately\
        \ 28.6\xB0 N latitude, it explicitly states that Maitland is \"generally slightly\
        \ further south than Titusville.\" Since it indicates a difference in position\
        \ (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for\
        \ the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 32751, FL
        (Maitland) is not located north of 32796, FL (Titusville)" as a clear comparative
        result.

    98ccd17a-3fb5-4d61-ac4c-cb97b5751293:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Maitland (32751) is situated to the south
        of Titusville (32796). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, indicating that 32751 is not north of 32796
        (it's south)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9ce42ba1-285c-4bd6-a388-9898d590f9ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the zip codes are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Maitland
        (32751) is located south of Titusville (32796), indicating a difference in
        location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is NO" and "Zip code 32751 is not located north of 32796" as its comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Titusville (32796)
        is generally further north in latitude compared to Maitland (32751)" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, with no qualifications about uncertainty
        or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" and
        confirms that 32751 (Maitland) is located north of 32796 (Titusville)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it specifically states that Windham is "north and slightly
        west of Yarmouth," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        determining that Windham (04062) is not located directly north of Yarmouth

    2d50bb10-8873-4555-a842-4cc8a312001a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Yarmouth is "further north" than Standish,
        indicating a difference in their positions. The NO is based on Yarmouth being
        more northerly than Standish, not on them being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that 04062 is not located north of 04096,
        and even specifies that Yarmouth is further north.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    36d4a328-1f74-4ba8-8b8a-3b52a486e88f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Yarmouth is "slightly
        northeast of Windham" and concludes NO because Yarmouth is "actually north
        of Windham" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. 04062, ME is not located
        north of 04096, ME" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO comparative

        N - a clear difference in values, not because they are equal. The NO is based\
        \ on finding that one location is further north than the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 04062 is not located
        north of 04096" as its final answer after comparing the latitudes. This is
        an explicit NO comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it notes that "Windham is generally west of Yarmouth,
        and slightly to the north" and that they are "more aligned west to east with
        a slight northern inclination for Windham." Since it acknowledges a difference
        in latitude (even if slight), this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its analysis, making this a straightforward classification.

        instead, it explicitly states that Yarmouth (04096) is "slightly north compared
        to Windham (04062)". The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 04062 is

        equal latitudes. Instead, it describes different positions for each location
        (Windham being "west and north of Portland" while Yarmouth is "east and north
        of Portland") and indicates directional differences. The NO answer is based
        on these positional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        preceded by an explicit explanation that "04062, ME (Windham) is not located

        that the locations were at equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated
        that Knoxville is "further north than Nashville" and used this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that zip code 37221 is not north of 37918. This is a direct
        comparative answer without any caveats about inability to determine or equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it specifically notes that 33993 is "slightly north"
        of 33905, though primarily west. Since it identifies a difference in position
        (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same latitude or equally positioned north-south. Instead, it indicates
        they are different, with 33993 being "more to the west" rather than north.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference (westward rather than northward),
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether 33993 is
        north of 33905. The answer is definitive and based on geographical analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it notes that while they're
        primarily different east-west, "some areas of Cape Coral can be slightly north
        or south of certain parts of Fort Myers." Since it acknowledges potential
        differences rather than equality, and the NO isn't based on them being at
        the same latitude, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. 33993 is
        not located north of 33905." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        slightly further north than most of Cape Coral (33993)" - this difference
        in position, even though described as "slight," means the NO answer was not
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 33993, FL
        is not located north of 33905, FL." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        ZIP codes are at the same location. Rather, it stated that 33993 is northwest
        of 33905, indicating a directional difference. The NO was based on the fact
        that it's not directly north, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        Abbeville (70510) is "situated to the north of Delcambre (70528)" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, 70528,

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        one location is "slightly north" of the other and concludes they are in different
        positions (one is south of the other). The NO answer was given because of
        this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that the Arkansas zip code is south of the North Carolina
        zip code. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        note the locations are "at nearly the same latitude," this is irrelevant since
        the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer,

        are equal. Instead, it stated that Rock Hill is southeast of Easley, which
        indicates a directional difference. The NO is based on the directional relationship
        being different from what was asked, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that while 29730 is northeast of 29640, it
        is actually southeast when considering strictly northern direction.
