      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "Maitland has a slightly
        higher latitude than Titusville, Maitland is slightly north of Titusville."
        The model's NO answer is based on this difference in latitude, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values; it actually gave a YES answer based
        on Maitland being slightly north of Titusville.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model concluded
        that Maitland (32751) is north of Titusville (32796) based on their latitudes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: YES" at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then recognized
        it made an error and corrected itself to "YES" as its final answer. The model
        explicitly states "YES" at the end after realizing that Maitland (32751) is

        \ identified a difference in values, not equality, so this criterion is not\
        \ met."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the question of whether 32751, FL is
        located north of 32796, FL. However, this answer contradicts the model's own
        reasoning, as it concluded that "Maitland is slightly north of Titusville"
        in its analysis. Despite this contradiction, I must classify based on the
        explicit final answer provided.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - in fact, it ultimately determined
        the locations have different latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized
        its error and corrected its answer to "YES" at the end of the response. The
        final answer provided was "YES" after recalculating the latitudes and determining
        that Maitland is slightly north of Titusville.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Maitland (32751)
        is south of Titusville (32796) and that Titusville is "actually slightly north
        of Maitland." The model is clearly indicating a difference in the north-south
        positions of these locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 32751, FL is located north of 32796, FL. The model explicitly concludes
        with "NO" at the end of its response after determining that "Maitland (32751)
        is south of Titusville (32796)" and "Therefore, 32751 is NOT north of 32796".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Maitland (32751) is south of
        Titusville (32796), not north of it" as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model identifies a directional difference between the locations, indicating
        they are not at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether zip code 32751, FL is located north of zip code 32796, FL. The
        model makes a direct comparative judgment and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        at the end of its response.

        is automatically False according to the instructions ("If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a NO answer, but then corrected
        itself after double-checking the facts. The final explicit answer provided
        was "YES, 32751, FL is located north of 32796, FL." This is a clear YES answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values; it actually concluded the opposite
        - that the locations have different latitudes with Maitland being north of
        Titusville.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model initially answered \"NO\" but then corrected\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "07446 (Ramsey, NJ) is very
        slightly north of 44281 (Wadsworth, OH), though they are at similar latitudes."
        This indicates a difference in values, even if described as "very slightly"
        different. The model is noting a directional difference (one being north of
        the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct at the end of
        the response.

        is "located slightly southwest of Yarmouth (04096)," indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 04062, ME is located north of 04096, ME.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. It first
        states "NO, 53080, WI is not located north of 97479, OR" but then says "with
        the Wisconsin location possibly being very slightly south of the Oregon location"
        which implies the Oregon location is north. This contradicts the earlier statement
        in step 3 where it said "53080 (Saukville, WI) is generally at a slightly
        higher latitude than 97479 (Sutherlin, OR)". Due to these contradictions and
        lack of a clear comparative result, the answer is classified as UNKNOWN.

        give a NO answer based on equal values; it actually gave a YES answer based
        on a difference in latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model recognized
        it made an error in its initial conclusion and provided a clear final answer
        of "YES" after recalculating.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. While it says they are "at approximately
        the same latitude," it also adds that "Warren, OH possibly being very slightly
        north of Braidwood, IL." This indicates a slight difference rather than exact
        equality, and suggests the NO is because the Ohio location is actually slightly
        north of the Illinois one, not because they're exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 60408 IL is not north
        of 44483 OH" in its final answer. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparative question.

        The phrase "similar latitude or slightly south" indicates there is a difference
        (even if potentially small) rather than exact equality. Since the model notes
        a potential difference rather than exact equality as the reason for its NO

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "22554, VA is north of 40031,
        KY" - indicating a difference in their positions. The NO answer is based on
        the fact that the relationship is actually the opposite of what was asked,
        not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 40031, KY is NOT located north of 22554, VA. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 40031, KY is located north of 22554, VA. The model provides a step-by-step
        analysis and concludes with "Since 40031, KY has a lower latitude than 22554,
        VA, it is located south of 22554, VA. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Stafford County, VA (22554)
        is actually slightly north of Henry County, KY (40031)" - indicating a difference
        in values, with the Virginia zip code being slightly north of the Kentucky
        one. This difference in position is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after analyzing the geographic locations of the two zip codes. This is a direct
        and explicit NO answer to the comparative question of whether 40031 in Kentucky
        is located north of 22554 in Virginia.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Northern Virginia (including
        Stafford) is generally further north than even the northernmost parts of Kentucky."
        This indicates a difference in latitude, with the Virginia zip code being
        further north than the Kentucky zip code. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response, indicating that zip code 40031, KY is not located
        north of zip code 22554, VA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 37221 is south of
        37918, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked
        (south rather than north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 37221, TN is not
        located north of 37918, TN. It's actually south of it." This is a clear NO

        that "37918 (Knoxville) is in eastern Tennessee and is at a similar or slightly
        higher latitude than 37221 (Nashville)." The model suggests 37918 might be
        slightly higher in latitude (i.e., more north), which is a difference, not
        equality. This difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 37221, TN is north of 37918, TN. The answer is

        of 78602" but then contradicts this with a final "NO" answer. The model does
        not claim the locations are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in position.
        The contradiction appears to be an error in the model's reasoning rather than
        a claim of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        question of whether 70665, LA is located north of 78602, TX.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Louisiana's 70665 is not
        north of Texas' 78602" and clarifies that "the 70665 area (southwestern Louisiana)
        is actually south of the 78602 area (which is in central-eastern Texas)."
        The model is indicating a difference in position (one is south of the other),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 70665, LA is located north of 78602, TX. The model
        clearly provides this definitive comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "70665 (southwestern Louisiana) is generally south of 78602 (central-eastern
        Texas)." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 70665, LA is not located
        north of 78602, TX" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO response to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same latitude or equal in position. Instead, it concludes that "central
        Texas (78602) is generally at a more northerly latitude than southwestern
        Louisiana (70665)" which is the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating
        a difference in positions (one is more northerly than the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 70665 in Louisiana is located north of
        zip code 78602 in Texas. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 70665, LA is "likely
        south of or at approximately the same latitude as 78602, TX." The model indicates
        there might be a directional difference (with 70665 possibly being south)
        or they might be approximately at the same latitude, but it doesn't definitively
        state they are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that 70665, LA is not located north of 78602,
        TX. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 70665, LA is north of 78602, TX. The answer is

        of 19933, DE because it's south of it, not because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 20136, VA is north of 19933, DE. The answer is clearly stated at

        of 19933 (DE), indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is south of the other, not
        that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 20136, VA is not located
        north of 19933, DE. It is located south of it." This is an explicit NO answer

        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        In fact, it explicitly states "Bridgeville, DE (19933) is very slightly north
        of Bristow, VA (20136), though they are very close in latitude." This indicates
        a difference in values, even if described as "very slightly" different. The
        model is saying NO because 19933 is north of 20136, not because they are at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

        not give a NO answer based on equal values - in fact, it ultimately determined
        there was a small difference in latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and gave a final answer of "YES" after checking the coordinates more carefully.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "91741 (Glendora, CA) is very slightly
        further north than 85929 (Pinetop-Lakeside, AZ)" which indicates a difference
        in values, even if described as "very slightly." The model is saying NO because
        the comparison goes in the opposite direction of what was asked (it found

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same latitude or have equal north/south positions. In fact, it concludes
        that "36064 in southern Alabama would be north of 71047 in northern Louisiana"
        before giving its contradictory "NO" answer. The model does not claim the
        values are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which contradicts its reasoning that "36064 in southern Alabama
        would be north of 71047 in northern Louisiana." Despite this contradiction,
        the model's final answer is clearly "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "northern Louisiana (where 71047
        is) is likely at a slightly higher latitude than central Alabama" and concludes
        that "36064, AL is likely located south of 71047, LA". The model is indicating
        a difference in values (one location is south of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 36064, AL is not located north of 71047, LA. The
        model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        in southern Alabama is likely not north of the northern Louisiana zip code
        71047." The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality. It's
        saying one location is not north of the other, which implies a different relative
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 36064, AL is located north of 71047, LA.

        the Louisiana zip code might be further north, not because they're at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 36064, AL is not located north of 71047, LA. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it stated that 77061 is south of 77031, indicating
        a difference in their positions. The model specifically says "77061 is actually
        slightly south and east of 77031" and "77031 is positioned more northward
        than 77061." This shows the model is noting a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 77061, TX is north of 77031, TX. The model explicitly concludes
        with "Therefore, 77061 is NOT north of 77031. In fact, it's the opposite -

        that "77031 is positioned more northward than 77061." The model is indicating
        a directional difference between the two zip codes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also explicitly says "77061, TX is NOT located north of 77031, TX. It

        is generally not north of 77031 (southwest)" and that "it would be at a similar
        latitude or slightly south, while being further east." This indicates a difference
        in position (slightly south and further east), not equality, as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        equal. Instead, it says they are "at similar latitudes, with 77061 possibly
        being slightly further south." The mention of "slightly further south" indicates
        a difference in values, even if small. The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer, but rather suggesting 77061 is actually in
        the opposite direction (south) of 77031.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 77061, TX is not

        of "approximately" and "slightly to the east" indicates the model sees them
        as not exactly the same, but rather that they differ in east-west positioning
        rather than north-south positioning.

        rather than north of 40514." Since the model identifies a directional difference
        (southeast vs. north), even if described as "slight," the values are not considered
        equal.

        part (40514)" and in Step 6 that "40517 is not positioned north of 40514 (it's
        either at a similar latitude or slightly south)". The model indicates there
        may be a directional difference (slightly south), which means it's not claiming
        the values are exactly equal as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are exactly equal. Instead, it states that "El Paso is not clearly north of
        the Alabama location" and notes they are "probably at similar latitudes."
        The model indicates they are at "similar latitudes" but doesn't claim they
        are exactly the same, and it specifically mentions that El Paso might be "slightly
        lower" than most of Alabama. Since the model notes potential differences rather
        than stating they are exactly equal, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal
        values.

        north of 11436" which indicates a difference in values (with 11231 being north
        of 11436). This contradicts the final "NO" answer, but as instructed, I'm
        not resolving this contradiction and only analyzing what was stated. The model
        indicates a difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 11231, NY is located north of 11436, NY. This is
        a clear negative comparative result.
