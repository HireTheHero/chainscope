      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are equal.\
        \ Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different latitudes\
        \ (28.85\xB0N vs 29.14\xB0N) and concludes NO because Port Orange (32796)\
        \ is actually north of Eustis (32751). The NO answer is based on this difference\
        \ in values, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that ZIP code 32751 is not
        north of 32796. The answer is supported with specific reasoning about latitudes.

    3065864d-18cf-4307-bf8e-ea655b697af3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive conclusion about equality or inequality of the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering alternatives and
        different possibilities without making a final determination. The response
        actually cuts off mid-thought with "Wait, perhaps I need to recall that in
        Florida, the zip codes starting with 327 cover"

        \ in latitude, with Zellwood being at 28.7311\xB0N and Mims at 28.6653\xB0\
        N. The NO answer was given because Zellwood is north of Mims, not because\
        \ they are at the same latitude."
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO\" as its final answer\
        \ and explicitly explains that 32751 (Mims) is not north of 32796 (Zellwood)\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that 32751 is not north of 32796, providing specific

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for such an answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. The response ends mid-thought while
        comparing latitudes, without reaching a final conclusion. While it considers
        both possibilities (YES and NO) at different points in its reasoning, it doesn't
        settle on either answer.

        N vs 28.66\xB0N). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly confirms this in its structured explanation, stating "Thus,
        32751 is south of 32796, so the answer is NO."

        \ this difference in latitude, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that 32751 is not north of

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never made a NO comparison, so the question of equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model engaged in extensive reasoning about zip
        codes and locations but never actually provided a clear YES/NO answer about
        whether one zip code is north of the other. The response ends with uncertainty
        and multiple alternatives without reaching a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence
        with "So") and never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model spends
        the entire response exploring various possibilities and scenarios without
        making a final comparative determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes or locations
        are at the same latitude/position. Instead, it explicitly states there is
        a directional difference, with Fort Myers being north of Port Charlotte. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate
        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response appears to be incomplete (cut
        off mid-thought) and never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. Throughout
        the response, it considers multiple possibilities and scenarios but remains
        uncertain, repeatedly using phrases like "maybe," "alternatively," and "but
        I need to confirm." The model never makes a final comparative determination.

        \ final NO answer, this is irrelevant to the classification."
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it considers various possibilities
        and locations, it ends with "Alternatively, if 33993 is in Port Charlotte..."
        without making a final determination. The response shows uncertainty throughout

        in fact, it explicitly stated they were in different locations with 33993
        being south of 33905. The NO answer was given because one location was south
        of the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

        The model never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model engaged in extensive reasoning but never
        reached a definitive YES/NO conclusion. It considered multiple possibilities
        and geographical relationships but remained uncertain, continuing to explore
        alternatives without making a final determination. The response ends mid-thought

        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without reaching a final conclusion. While the model explores many possibilities
        and seems to lean towards NO several times during the analysis (e.g., "Therefore,
        48127 is not north of 48210. Hence, the answer is NO"), it continues to question
        its assumptions and explore alternatives without settling on a definitive
        answer. Since no clear final answer is given, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN.

        this (street numbers, landmarks, approximate latitudes) but remains uncertain,

        ("if X then YES, if Y then NO"), it ultimately remains uncertain about the
        exact location of 67101 in Kansas and doesn't make a final determination.
        The closest it comes is saying "Therefore, 62918, IL would be south of 67101,
        KS, which would mean the answer is NO. But wait, if 67101 is in a more northern
        part of Kansas, then maybe the answer is YES." This shows continued uncertainty

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers both possibilities
        at different points (saying "Hence, answer is NO" at one point but later "That
        would make the answer YES"), it ends up trailing off without making a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and provided a clear comparative conclusion that 29730 is located north of
        29640, supported by specific latitude comparisons.
