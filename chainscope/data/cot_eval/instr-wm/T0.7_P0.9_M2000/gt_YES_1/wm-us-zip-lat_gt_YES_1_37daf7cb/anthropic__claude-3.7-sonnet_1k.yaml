      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after determining that Maitland (32751) is positioned slightly further
        north than Titusville (32796) based on their latitude values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Titusville (32796)
        is at a higher latitude than Maitland (32751), and that Maitland is positioned
        south of Titusville. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly concludes that zip code 32751 (Maitland) is NOT north of zip code
        32796 (Titusville), but rather south of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    458eb213-5dab-4022-8044-0e7b204cd317:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Maitland (32751) is at a slightly higher
        latitude than Titusville (32796)" and "Maitland is slightly further north."
        The model is indicating there is a difference (Maitland is slightly north
        of Titusville), not that they are the same. The "NO" answer appears to contradict
        the model's own analysis, but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not resolving
        contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the question of whether 32751, FL is
        north of 32796, FL.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Titusville (32796)
        is "located farther north in Florida than Maitland (32751)." The model is
        indicating a difference in north-south positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that 32751, FL is not located north of 32796, FL. This is a direct

        NORTH of Maitland" and "Titusville (32796) is positioned slightly north of
        Maitland (32751)." The model is indicating a directional difference (Titusville
        being north of Maitland), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 32751, FL located north of 32796, FL?" The model clearly
        indicates that Titusville (32796) is positioned slightly north of Maitland
        (32751), not the other way around.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "These zip codes are at nearly
        identical latitudes, with 53080 being very slightly north of 97479, but the
        difference is negligible." This indicates the model is saying NO because it
        considers the difference to be negligible, but it does explicitly note that
        53080 is "very slightly north" - which means they are not exactly equal. Since
        the model notes a difference, even if described as slight, this does not qualify
        as stating the values are exactly/approximately equal as the primary reason
        for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the latitudes of the two zip codes. This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.

    28856f9b-9e81-4801-8cd4-7a9ec75cef21:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states "53080 in Wisconsin is slightly
        north of 97479 in Oregon" as the reason for its NO answer. Although it mentions
        they are at "very similar latitudes," it still identifies a difference in
        their positions, with 53080 being slightly north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the statement "97479, OR is further north than 53080,
        WI" is not true. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        it states that "Sutherlin, Oregon is very slightly further north than Saukville,
        Wisconsin by a tiny margin (about 0.01 degrees)." The model is noting a difference
        in values, even though it's described as "very slightly" and "tiny margin."
        The reason for the NO answer is that the Oregon location is slightly further
        north, not that they are equal.

        response after comparing the latitudes of the two zip codes. The model concludes
        that since "76148 in Texas has a higher latitude than 88330 in New Mexico,
        the Texas location is further north," and therefore answers "NO" to the question
        of whether 88330, NM is located north of 76148, TX.

        (which should mean IL is not north of OH), but I'm instructed not to resolve
        contradictions. Since the model notes a difference rather than equality, this
        doesn't qualify as equal values.

        zip code. The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 70665, LA located north of 78602, TX?" The model explicitly
        concludes "Therefore, the Louisiana zip code (70665) is located SOUTH of the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Delaware is north of Virginia,
        and even though one location is in northern Virginia and the other is in southern
        Delaware, the Delaware location is still north of the Virginia location. The
        model is indicating a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        It concludes that "20136, VA (Bristow) is NOT located north of 19933, DE (Dagsboro)"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that despite the higher numerical value
        of the Virginia ZIP code, Delaware's geographic position means that the Delaware
        location is north of the Virginia location. The model is indicating a difference
        in position (one is north of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - 20136, VA is not located

        is north of ZIP code 20136 in Virginia, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model's reasoning is based on Delaware being
        north of Virginia and the pattern of ZIP codes, not on the locations being
        equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not give a
        NO answer based on equal values; it gave a YES answer based on Bristow having
        a higher latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially made an error in its conclusion,
        stating "NO" despite finding that Bristow, VA has a higher latitude. However,
        it then corrected itself, explicitly stating "YES" as its final answer, indicating
        that 20136, VA is indeed located north of 19933, DE.

        model is indicating a directional difference (Virginia is south of Delaware),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 20136, VA is located north of 19933, DE. The model explicitly concludes
        with "Therefore, 20136, VA is NOT located north of 19933, DE. Virginia is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that Tennessee is north of North Carolina, and therefore the zip code in North
        Carolina would be south of the zip code in Tennessee. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 28658, NC is not located

        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says "62918 IL is likely south
        of (or possibly at similar latitude as) 67101 KS" which indicates a difference
        in position (with 62918 IL being south) or at best a similarity but not equality.
        The primary reason for the NO answer is that 62918 IL is likely south of 67101

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in latitude, stating "99206 has
        a higher latitude than 98311" and that "Spokane Valley area is actually slightly
        further north than the Silverdale/Bremerton area." The model is giving NO
        as an answer because 99206 is north of 98311, not because they are at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 98311, WA is not north of 99206, WA. This is a clear
        negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in latitude, stating "99206 has
        a slightly higher latitude than 98311" and "Spokane Valley is slightly north
        of Silverdale." The model gives a NO answer because it found that the opposite
        relationship is true (99206 is north of 98311, not the other way around).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 98311, WA is not located north of 99206, WA. The
        model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the primary reason for its NO answer. While it mentions they are
        at "very similar latitudes," it actually concludes that "Spokane Valley is
        typically slightly north of Silverdale" and that 98311 "is either slightly
        south of it or at approximately the same latitude." The mention of a directional
        difference (slightly south/north) means it's not claiming exact equality as
        the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 98311, WA is north of 99206, WA. The answer is clearly stated at
        the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 99206 has a "slightly higher latitude than
        Silverdale (98311)" and that 98311 is "actually slightly south of" 99206.
        The model is noting a difference in values (even if described as "slight"),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (98311 is not north
        of 99206; it's actually slightly south of it)" as its final answer. This is
        a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 98311, WA located north of 99206, WA?" The model clearly
        concludes that 98311 is NOT north of 99206.
