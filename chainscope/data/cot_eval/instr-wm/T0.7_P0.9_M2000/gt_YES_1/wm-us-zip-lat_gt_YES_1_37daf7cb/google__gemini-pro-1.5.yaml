      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that 32751 is numerically less than 32796 and used
        this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer was based on the relative
        positions being different (one being south of the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because it determines 32751 is likely
        south of 32796 based on zip code patterns. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because Louisiana is described as being
        east of Texas instead of north. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference ("east, not north"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal - rather, it's based on the geographical impossibility due to the east-west
        relationship between the states. The model explicitly states that Indiana
        is east of Iowa, making a direct north relationship impossible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing geographical reasoning for why one location cannot
        be directly north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences, stating that 50322,
        IA is "further west" and "further north" than 46761, IN. The NO answer is
        based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there are differences
        in position, with one location being "significantly east" and "slightly south"
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Iowa is "further north than
        Indiana overall" and gave this difference in position as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

    c337338b-8f90-42d2-b607-9aac407da62d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it concluded NO because Iowa is stated to be further
        north than Indiana, indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning about the relative positions of
        Indiana and Iowa.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c888be05-15de-4d0a-81db-07d425e1798e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't
        make the determination without more information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (unable to answer definitively
        without more information)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        without additional data. This is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it explains that while the locations are
        in different states (MS and AL), and while MS is generally west of AL, it
        cannot definitively determine the north/south relationship without more specific
        location information. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient evidence
        to support a northern relationship, not because the locations are at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes or locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning
        that 05477 is likely south of 05677 due to the numerical difference between
        the zip codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it concluded NO after reasoning that Florida is
        generally south of Texas, and specifically that the Florida location is "likely
        south of" the Texas location. Since it indicated a directional difference
        (even if uncertain), this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. Instead, it reasoned about relative geographical positions
        and likelihood, noting that Florida is east of Texas and suggesting the latitude
        relationship was "unlikely" rather than equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

    22bdeb4d-3dca-474f-9295-258fd55928d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the states
        being at equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "Florida sits
        further south" and notes that while some parts may be at similar latitudes,
        there are differences in positioning. The NO answer appears to be based on
        these differences rather than equality.

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there are differences
        in latitude, with Florida being "generally further south than Texas." The
        NO answer appears to be based on these differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its comparative result, making this a clear NO answer.

        difference in position ("Florida is south of Texas") as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Illinois being south of Massachusetts), not because the locations are at
        equal latitudes. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with Illinois being "generally south of Massachusetts".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Illinois
        is south of Massachusetts.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Illinois is south of Massachusetts
        and therefore a location in Illinois cannot be north of a location in Massachusetts.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is given as a direct comparative result based on geographical

        reasoning, stating that 98311 is likely south of 99206 based on zip code patterns.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes they are different (98311 vs 99206) and uses
        this difference to make a directional comparison. The NO answer is based on
        the conclusion that one location is south of the other, not because the values
        are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that 98311 is numerically less than 99206.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        - in fact, it explicitly noted that 98311 is numerically less than 99206.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this numerical difference rather than
        any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a straightforward
        classification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about different zip code values
        (98311 vs 99206) and concludes NO based on their relative positions. The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its reasoning steps, without any caveats about
        uncertainty or inability to determine.
