      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific geographical difference,
        stating that "Maitland (32751) is located south of Titusville (32796)" and
        "Titusville is closer to the Atlantic coast and farther north compared to
        Maitland." The NO answer is based on these geographical differences, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear comparative result.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Maitland (32751) is geographically
        located south of Titusville (32796)" and "Titusville (32796) is further north
        than Maitland (32751)". The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 32751 is not north of
        32796" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Maitland (32751) is south
        of Titusville (32796)" and "Titusville (32796) is north of Maitland (32751)".
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 32751 is not located
        north of 32796" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO response to the

        the same location or have equal values. Instead, it specifically states that
        "Titusville (32796) is actually farther north than Maitland (32751)" which
        indicates a difference in their positions, not equality. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 32751 is not located
        north of 32796" as its final answer. This is a clear negative comparative

        stating "Titusville (32796) is actually slightly north of Maitland (32751)."
        This indicates a difference in location (even if described as "slightly"),
        not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model determined that Windham (04062) is located

        (04096) is north of Windham (04062)". The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (one location being north of the other), not on equality of positions.

        'Is 04062, ME located north of 04096, ME?' is NO" in its conclusion. This

        Instead, it explicitly states that Champlin (55316) is located slightly southwest
        of Hugo (55038), and that Hugo (55038) is farther north than Champlin (55316).

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Champlin (55316) is south
        of Hugo (55038), so the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, stating that "19134 is actually located to the northeast of
        19131, not directly north" and "19131 is more westward, while 19134 extends
        toward the river in the northeast section of the city". The model is indicating
        a directional difference (northeast vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 19134 is not located

        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Since 19134 is not north

        19134 is in North Philadelphia/Kensington, and that 19134 is positioned more
        to the northeast rather than directly north of 19131. The NO answer is based

        Philadelphia (tending eastward but also somewhat north). The model specifically
        notes that "While 19134 is further northeast, it is not strictly 'north' of

        Instead, it explains that 19134 is "east and slightly north" of 19131, indicating
        there is a directional difference. The model says NO because 19134 is "not
        definitively north in a strict sense" - not because the locations are at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the best answer is NO"

        "in general, 40517 is positioned more to the south compared to 40514" which
