      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Haldia
        is west of Raichak, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "Answer: NO" at the end of its response. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since this only needs to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis determining that Haldia Energy Power Station
        is east of Raichak.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (south vs east), not on the locations being equal or the same. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference, with one location being south of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison that concludes Haldia Energy
        Power Station is south of Raichak, not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dc0fb296-b6f5-4e37-90d4-1dc09a24b348:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Haldia is south of Raichak,
        indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference (south vs east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Lake Ray Roberts is "positioned more to the northwest relative to Grapevine
        Lake," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Lake
        Ray Roberts is not located east of Grapevine Lake" as its final conclusion.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Ray Roberts is northwest of Grapevine Lake, not because the locations are
        equal/identical. It explicitly states a directional difference ("northwest
        of Grapevine Lake, not east").

        rather the non-existence of one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that since one station doesn't exist,
        the comparison is impossible. While it explicitly states "NO" as its final
        answer, this is a case where the model is rejecting the premises of the question
        by noting one location doesn't exist, making it impossible to compare. Per

        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise because one of the stations
        (Brockley Hill) doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. While it
        states "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting the premise
        rather than making a comparative determination, so this falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that YUL
        Condos is west of Maison Alcan, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("YUL
        Condos is west of Maison Alcan, not east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that YUL Condos is west (not east) of Maison Alcan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that YUL Condos is west of Maison Alcan,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations based
        on their street numbers (3050 vs 1188).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        This NO is a direct comparative answer to whether YUL Condos is east of Maison
        Alcan.

        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying the church is "west" of the dam. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Sarang Community

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying the power plant is "west" of the church,
        not because they're at the same location. Any directional difference, even

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in location, with Holy
        Trinity Church being west of 75 Rockefeller Plaza. The model describes distinct
        locations on opposite sides of Central Park.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Holy Trinity Church is not located east of 75
        Rockefeller Plaza. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Church is northwest of La Monnaie, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one location is east
        of the other. The model provides specific directional information (northwest
        vs east) to support this answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different relative positions (one is southwest of the other),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states the Outspan
        Hotel is southwest of the Beles Hydroelectric Power Plant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative directional analysis concluding that one

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the Outspan Hotel is southwest of the power plant), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly identifies a relative positional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Tadworth is south of Dollis Hill House (which is northwest),
        making a directional distinction. The model did not claim the locations were
        at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Tadworth railway station is east of Dollis Hill House. The answer
        is based on a directional comparison, not inability to determine or rejection
        of premises.

        difference, saying the General Walker Hotel is southwest of the Orangery Palace.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question about whether the General Walker
        Hotel is east of the Orangery Palace. The answer is definitive and provides
        directional reasoning (southwest vs east).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying "Berchtesgaden (General Walker Hotel)
        is further west than Potsdam (Orangery Palace)." The NO answer was based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result based on relative positions, stating
        that the General Walker Hotel is not east of Orangery Palace because Berchtesgaden

        are equal - it explicitly states that Potsdam (Orangery Palace) is east of
        Berchtesgaden (General Walker Hotel). The NO is because their relative positions
        are different, with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that the General Walker Hotel
