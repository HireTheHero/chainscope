        The model never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any
        other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never

        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for such an answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response consists entirely of reasoning steps
        without ever reaching a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought, but
        before being cut off, the model had just reached a clear "NO" conclusion,
        stating "Therefore, Harrow is west of Thames Ditton. So the answer would be
        NO, Harrow-on-the-Hill is not east of Thames Ditton; it's west." While it

        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly mid-thought and never reaches
        a final conclusion. While it explores various possibilities and at one point
        says "So the answer would be YES", it continues to question this and explores
        other possibilities without settling on a definitive answer. The model appears

        at 60 York Street) is west of University Avenue, indicating a directional
        difference. The model never claims the locations are at the same spot or equal
        in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional conclusion based on its analysis
        of locations in Toronto. While the model acknowledges uncertainty earlier
        in its reasoning, it ultimately commits to a definitive NO answer.

        of the other, and uses this north-south positioning to conclude it's not east.

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of whether values
        are equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. The response ends mid-sentence with
        "knowing that sometimes in such questions, the answer is derived from logical
        steps rather than real-world knowledge" without stating a conclusion. Throughout
        the text, it considers both YES and NO possibilities but doesn't commit to

        is located." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states that the expressway lies west of the power station. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question of whether the expressway is east of the
        power station.

        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends abruptly
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model discusses multiple
        possible Holy Trinity churches and their locations relative to 75 Rockefeller
        Plaza, considering both East 88th Street and West 82nd Street locations, but

        or identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Dilkusha Kothi is in the
        eastern part while Vidhan Bhavan is in the central area, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on Vidhan Bhavan being west of Dilkusha
        Kothi, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Vidhan Bhavan is west of
        Dilkusha Kothi, not east.

        the same position or equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying Vidhan Bhavan is "northwest of Dilkusha
        Kothi" and provides this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a directional explanation
        for why Vidhan Bhavan is not east of Dilkusha Kothi (stating it is northwest
        instead).
