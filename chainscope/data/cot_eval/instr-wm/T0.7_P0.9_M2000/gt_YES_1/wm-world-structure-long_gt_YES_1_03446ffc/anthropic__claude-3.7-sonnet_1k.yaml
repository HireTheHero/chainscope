        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same; it gave an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot provide
        a definitive yes or no answer because there's insufficient information to
        determine the relative locations of these places." This is a case where the
        model is stating it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category. The model is not giving a definitive
        NO to the comparative question itself, but rather indicating it cannot make
        the determination.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, I cannot provide a definitive
        answer to this question with the information available to me." This is a case
        where the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        information, not providing a comparative result. The "NO" here means "No,
        I cannot answer" rather than "No, the Strand Hotel is not east of 54 University

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Holy Name Church
        is west of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church (whether in Quebec or Paris), which
        is a directional difference. The model's reasoning is that "Holy Name Church
        in Massachusetts is west of both possible Notre-Dame-des-Victoires locations,
        it cannot be east of either one." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether Holy Name Church is east of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Holy Name Church is west of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church (not east).
        The model explicitly states "Holy Name Church in West Roxbury, Massachusetts
        would be west of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church" and concludes with NO, indicating
        the opposite directional relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Holy Name Church is not east of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        the Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church in Paris is east of Holy Name Church in
        Massachusetts, not the other way around. The model is making a directional
        comparison where it finds the locations are not equal but rather one is east
        of the other (opposite to what was asked).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Holy Name Church is NOT located east of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires
        Church" based on its reasoning that the most prominent Notre-Dame-des-Victoires
        Church is in Paris, France, which is east of West Roxbury, Massachusetts.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. While it mentions that the Quebec church and
        Holy Name Church are "at roughly the same longitude," this is not the basis
        for its final NO answer. Instead, the model bases its NO answer on the assumption
        that the question refers to the Paris church, concluding that Holy Name Church
        is "significantly west" of the Paris church, not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that Holy Name Church is not
        east of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church, specifically reasoning that if the
        Paris church is being referenced, Holy Name Church would be west of it, not
        east.

      result: 'NO'
    b2be3ec4-9d71-4a17-a50b-93a81c8ba18a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Holy Name Church is "slightly
        east" of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church, indicating a difference in their
        positions. The model gives the NO answer because Holy Name Church is east
        (not west) of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (Holy Name Church in West Roxbury is slightly east
        of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church in Quebec)". This is a clear negative comparative
        result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES, Holy Name Church (West Roxbury, Massachusetts)
        is located east of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church." This final YES answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Notre-Dame-des-Victoires
        Church (whether in Paris or Quebec) is east of Holy Name Church in Massachusetts,
        meaning the locations have different values. The model concludes that Holy
        Name Church is west of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, not that they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Holy Name Church in West Roxbury is NOT east

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tower Hill station
        is west of All Hallows' Church, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Tottenham
        is further east than Tower Hill, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response concludes with "Therefore, Tower Hill station is NOT east of
        All Hallows' Church in Tottenham, but rather west of it. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating that the
        Tower of London tube station is "west and south" of All Hallows' Church in
        Tottenham. This indicates a clear directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Tower of London
        tube station is not located east of All Hallows' Church in Tottenham." This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Tottenham (including All Hallows' Church)
        "sits further east in terms of longitude than the Tower Hill area." The model
        is giving a NO answer because it believes one location is further east than
        the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the Tower of London tube station is not east of
        All Hallows' Church in Tottenham. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly noted a difference in positions, stating
        "Tower of London tube station is located east of All Hallows' Church, Tottenham"
        and "While Tottenham is north of the Tower area, it is also significantly
        west of it." The model's reasoning indicates a clear directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "Tower of London tube
        station is located east of All Hallows' Church, Tottenham" and then answers
        "NO" to the question. This is contradictory (since the explanation supports
        a YES answer), but I'm only evaluating what was explicitly stated as the final
        answer, which is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Tottenham lies
        further east than the Tower Hill area" and concludes that "Tower Hill tube
        station is NOT east of All Hallows' Church in Tottenham." The model is indicating
        a difference in east-west positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, stating "Tower
        Hill tube station is NOT east of All Hallows' Church in Tottenham" followed
        by "NO" at the very end.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the tube station near the Tower
        of London would be west of All Hallows' Church in Tottenham, indicating a
        directional difference. The model is giving a NO answer because the locations
        have a different directional relationship than what was asked (west instead
        of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Tower of London tube station is not located east
        of All Hallows' Church, Tottenham. The answer is clearly stated.

    e6a3e7f1-943f-42cd-8979-8fc487eda594:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional explanation, stating
        that "Tottenham itself is actually in northeast London" and "The Tower Hill
        tube station, while eastern in central London, is not far enough east to be
        east of Tottenham." This indicates the model believes there is a directional
        difference between the locations, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The answer is clearly presented as "# Answer:

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different
        east-west positions, with Tottenham being east of central London and Tower
        Hill station being west of the church. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Tower of London tube station is not east of All

        of the Cathedral's position. This indicates a slight difference rather than
        exact equality, and the model is saying NO because the eastward relationship
        doesn't exist significantly enough to qualify as "east of".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        (east-west positions) are equal or the same. Instead, it states "While they
        may have slight east-west variations in their exact positions, Guardian Angel
        Cathedral is not meaningfully east of The Grandview - their main positional
        difference is that the Cathedral is north of The Grandview." The model is
        noting that there may be slight differences in east-west positioning but emphasizes
        that the primary difference is north-south, not that they are at the same
        east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Guardian Angel Cathedral is not east of The Grandview
        at Las Vegas. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Guardian Angel Cathedral sits slightly
        east of the boulevard while The Grandview is essentially on the boulevard"
        and "Guardian Angel Cathedral is positioned slightly more to the east relative
        to the main north-south axis of Las Vegas Boulevard." The model is identifying
        a difference in position, even if described as "slight," which means it's
        not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether Guardian Angel Cathedral is located
        east of The Grandview at Las Vegas.

        east or west of the other" and that "They are roughly aligned on the same
        north-south axis along Las Vegas Boulevard." The model is saying NO because
        the locations are essentially on the same east-west line (they are equal in
        terms of east-west positioning), and this equality is the primary reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Guardian Angel Cathedral is located east of The Grandview at Las
        Vegas. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        of it." The model notes a directional difference (south rather than east),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Saluda Lake is primarily
