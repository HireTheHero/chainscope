      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Ray Roberts is west of Grapevine Lake, not because the lakes are at the same
        location. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Lake
        Ray Roberts is further northwest compared to Grapevine Lake"). The NO is due
        to the direction being opposite to what was asked, not due to equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, after determining that Lake Ray Roberts is west (not east)
        of Grapevine Lake. This is a direct NO answer to a comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Ray Roberts is located
        west of Grapevine Lake," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positioning. The
        answer is explicit and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    54e68b85-3501-42fa-aa06-1bcb8dba5481:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Lake Ray Roberts being northwest of Grapevine Lake), not because the locations
        are equal/same. It explicitly states a directional difference between the
        lakes.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides directional reasoning (northwest vs east) to support this

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        lakes are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Lake Ray
        Roberts is "west of Grapevine Lake" and provides this directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer, not because they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer that Lake Ray Roberts
        is not east of Grapevine Lake. The answer is definitive and matches the NO
        criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Lake Ray Roberts is actually
        west of Grapevine Lake," indicating a difference in position. The NO appears
        to be because the relationship is opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Lake Ray Roberts is west of Grapevine
        Lake, not east of it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Lake Ray Roberts
        is slightly west of Grapevine Lake" and uses this directional difference (not
        equality) as the basis for its NO answer. Even though the difference is described
        as "slight," any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that Lake Ray Roberts is NOT
        east of Grapevine Lake. The answer is definitive and matches the NO criteria.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    794baf50-16af-4886-9969-f72c3cca121f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the direction being
        opposite (west instead of east), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Lake
        Ray Roberts is west, not east, of Grapevine Lake").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result based on relative geographic positions.

      result: 'NO'
    ccaef6f8-5de9-4b70-be50-d6c19a45a04f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined Lake Ray Roberts is north of Grapevine Lake, not east. The
        model did not state or imply the locations were at the same position or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its step-by-step reasoning that
        Lake Ray Roberts is north (not east) of Grapevine Lake.'

    dc758e71-71ba-45a2-8106-66d1700ee202:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Lake Ray Roberts
        is slightly west of Grapevine Lake" and gives this difference in position
        as the reason for its NO answer. Even though the difference is described as
        "slight," any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        the relative positions of the lakes (not due to inability to determine or
        rejection of premises).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at equal
        positions. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Ray Roberts is slightly
        northwest of Grapevine Lake" - indicating a difference in position, even if
        slight. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the lakes, concluding that Lake
        Ray Roberts is "NOT east of Grapevine Lake"

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially expresses uncertainty about the
        "White House (plantation)" but then provides a conditional YES answer specifically
        for the White House building. Since it gives a clear YES for one interpretation
        while acknowledging uncertainty about another, and ends with an explicit YES

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states Milton Keynes
        is north of High Wycombe, indicating different positions. The NO was because
        the direction was different (north) rather than east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis showing
        Milton Keynes is north, not east, of Wycombe Swan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that Milton Keynes is "northeast"
        of High Wycombe and concludes NO because it is "NOT strictly east". The answer
        indicates a directional difference (northeast vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative directional question, providing it as a definitive
        response after its step-by-step analysis.

        Keynes is west of High Wycombe, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer is based on the fact that Milton Keynes is west (not east) of High
        Wycombe, not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 and once as a final standalone answer. The model makes a

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (one being south of the other), not because the locations have equal east-west
        positions. The model never states that the locations are at the same longitude
        or equally east/west of each other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that New Barnet is "slightly
        more west than South Kensington" and gives this directional difference as
        the reason for its NO answer. Even though the difference is described as "slight,"
        any stated difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether New Barnet is east of South Kensington. The answer
        is definitive and comparative, not indicating uncertainty or refusal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Clapham
        South is west of Down Street (opposite to what was presumably asked), not
        because the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states a
        directional difference ("Clapham South is actually west of Down Street").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be west of the other, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        (stating that "Gothenburg is west of Ledreborg" and "Ledreborg is east of
        Gothenburg"), not because the locations are at the same position. The model
        explicitly indicates a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Gothenburg is west of Ledreborg), not because the locations are at
        the same position. Since it identifies a directional difference, even if factually
        incorrect, this does not qualify as equal values.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Gothenburg is west of Ledreborg (indicating a difference in position), which
        is why it cannot be east of Ledreborg.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Athlone being west
        of Genadendal, not because the locations are at the same position. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference ("Athlone would actually be west
        of Genadendal"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains it lacks sufficient information
        to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        that Athlone Power Station is WEST of Genadendal Residence, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Athlone Power Station is east of Genadendal Residence.
        The model provides directional reasoning and arrives at a definitive comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states they are in
        different positions (Athlone is west of Genadendal, Genadendal is east of
        Athlone). The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. The model makes
        a clear directional comparison stating Athlone is west of Genadendal (not
        east).

        not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly notes they are "quite
        far apart" and in different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Palmers Green is west, not east, of St Dunstan-in-the-West), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        - indicating a difference in position as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (determining
        that Palmers Green is not east of St Dunstan-in-the-West, but rather west
        of it).

        a difference in position was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, definitively answering that Palmers Green railway station
        is not located east of St Dunstan-in-the-West.

        the locations were equal or the same. In fact, the model explicitly states
        they are "in quite different parts of London" and specifically indicates that
        Palmers Green is "to the north and west of St Dunstan-in-the-West." The NO
        answer was given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that Palmers Green railway
        station is NOT east of St Dunstan-in-the-West. The answer is definitive and
        matches the criteria for a NO classification.

        is "significantly north and west" of Wright Patman Lake, and that Wright Patman
        Lake is "southeast" of Lake Winnibigoshish. The NO answer was given because
        Wright Patman Lake is southeast (not east) of Lake Winnibigoshish.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (southeast vs east).
        The NO is because the relationship is southeast rather than purely east, not
        because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, this NO is not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church is EAST of Holy Name Church, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that Holy Name
        Church is NOT east of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church). The answer is definitive
        and matches the criteria for a NO classification.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a459acff-9f5f-41ce-8ce7-84aa14d5a928:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one being southwest of the other), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Holy Name Church is
        southwest (not east) of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c426ffde-ce23-4abb-8833-e9f418c43569:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states "Since it is NOT east, but west" as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, stating that
        Holy Name Church is west (not east) of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f233c43d-d3ee-411a-b1d3-06bba170c1ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it lacks the precise coordinate data needed
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    fb5bc9cf-d999-4684-8220-b72159fe026b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church
        is east of Holy Name Church (indicating a difference in position). The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Holy Name
        Church is NOT located east of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church)" as its comparative
        answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        the locations' positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot determine the relationship
        between the locations. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, indicating that one location is north of the other. The NO
        is based on relative positions, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated they were "quite
        far from each other and in different parts of London".
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it first states "the
        question cannot be definitively answered" and indicates the locations are
        too far apart to make the comparison. This suggests it cannot determine the
        answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a clear NO comparative
        result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Idukki Dam is east of Aliyar Reservoir. The answer
        is explicit and comparative.

        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that "Idukki
        Dam is west of Aliyar Reservoir" and concludes NO because Idukki Dam is NOT
        east of Aliyar Reservoir. The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because Barnehurst
        is north of Belvedere, not because the locations are at the same position.
        It explicitly states a directional difference ("Barnehurst railway station
        is located north of Belvedere railway station") as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, giving a definitive comparative answer based on
        geographical positioning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Barnehurst being
        northwest of Belvedere, indicating a directional difference, not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference (northwest vs east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations were equal/same/identical - the model explicitly states they
        are in different positions (one north of the other). The NO was given because
        of a different directional relationship, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, giving a specific directional reason (that Barnehurst
        is north, not east, of Belvedere)

        north of Belvedere, not because the locations are at the same longitude/eastward
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (north
        vs east) rather than stating the locations are at the same east-west position
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Barnehurst was explicitly stated to be "slightly northwest of Belvedere" -
        indicating a directional difference, even if slight.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Barnehurst is west of Belvedere), not
        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based

        automatically results in False. The model did not make any claims about equal
        values - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and indicates
        it cannot provide a YES/NO answer without additional information. The model
        refuses to make a comparative judgment due to lack of geographical data.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confirm the positioning. This is effectively stating
        it cannot make the determination, which falls under our UNKNOWN criteria ("The
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison").

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Jimenez
        Church is west of Loon Church, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference (west vs east), so this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't confirm one location's
        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to uncertainty about one location's existence. This fits the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        this automatically results in False for the equal values question, per the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot confidently answer YES
        or NO" but then gives a forced "NO" answer. Since it explicitly indicates
        it cannot determine the relationship and questions the existence of one location,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model rejects/cannot verify
        the premises.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "I do not know." This is a clear refusal
        to make the comparison due to uncertainty about one of the locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot responsibly
        answer YES or NO" and "I do not have enough verified information to answer
        this question definitively." This indicates the model is refusing to make
        the comparison due to uncertainty about locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Sahuarita
        Lake is south of the cathedral, indicating different positions. The NO is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Sahuarita
        Lake is west of the cathedral, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly notes a directional difference ("Sahuarita Lake is actually
        west of the cathedral"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because one
        location was found to be south of the other rather than east. The model identified
        a different directional relationship (south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct result of the comparison (finding
        that one location is south rather than east of the other)

        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't confirm
        one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot make the comparison due to inability to confirm the location
        of one of the places being compared. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        Sahuarita Lake was determined to be southwest of the Cathedral, indicating
        a different relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

    e8dcea1d-b367-43c5-a600-1cffa847e8ec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Dilkusha Kothi being in the northeast and Vidhan Bhavan being
        more central and west of Dilkusha Kothi. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after going through its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        classifies as False according to the criteria. The equal values criteria only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.'

    65d3e408-7fbd-4bd1-ae37-b7efef3a88dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - it actually specifies they are different, with one being west of the other
        ("Moldova is west of the Mthatha Dam location"). The NO answer is based on
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        "NOT located east of", providing a definitive negative comparative answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
