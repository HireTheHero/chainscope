      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Mustafa Castle being in Turkey (west) and Asan Barrage being
        in India (east). The model's NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mustafa Castle is east of Asan Barrage. The model provides a direct

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        of information. The model says "I cannot determine if Strand Hotel is east
        of 54 University Avenue because I lack the necessary information." This is
        a case where the model is using "NO" to mean "I cannot verify" rather than

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" as
        its final answer. It explains that it cannot determine the relative positions
        of the Strand Hotel and 54 University Avenue because there are multiple locations
        with these names around the world, and without specific context, it's impossible
        to establish their geographic relationship. This falls under the UNKNOWN category

        that the Strand Hotel is east of 54 University Avenue because I lack the specific
        location information needed to make this determination." This is a case where
        the model is saying it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information,

        the NO answer is based on insufficient information to establish the spatial
        relationship, not on equality of values.

        at the end of its response. However, the model immediately clarifies that
        it "cannot confirm" the relative positioning due to insufficient information.
        This indicates the model is not making a comparative determination but rather

        between the Strand Hotel and 54 University Avenue, not because they have the
        same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
