    33c6e438-db03-4f36-8e4b-d41ec6fdb3ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, YES."
        after its step-by-step analysis determining that Haldia is south-east of Raichak,
        which includes an eastern component.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6f593ba2-4935-4bfd-aea5-55bb5c3cc94b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it actually stated there was a directional difference, noting
        that Haldia is "slightly southeast of Raichak" but concluded NO because this
        slight eastward component wasn't considered predominant enough.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Haldia
        is not predominantly east of Raichak.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    73daf89e-cbd8-4898-afda-d662354f6134:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Haldia is south of Raichak (not east),
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7c2c1198-60f6-4be0-9eca-e65b640edefa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (south vs east), not because the locations are at equal positions.
        The model explicitly states "South is not East" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Haldia is south of Raichak,
        not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, YES."

    b71a2ed1-4155-4840-9952-d3effdbca768:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" making this a clear YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b8d9f91e-b755-4dea-871f-8c50c726f1f5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because Haldia is described as being
        primarily south of Raichak (with possibly some southeast component). The model
        explicitly notes a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Haldia
        is primarily south rather than east of Raichak.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cbafaf71-b3fd-4b1e-aae7-a947b049f589:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after going through its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f5ec9e95-fc22-45a1-9620-7d2befd36dd5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Haldia being south of Raichak, and explicitly stating "South is not East"),
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model clearly indicates
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    5265e4a7-87b9-4cb0-a4f8-70fe38597584:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it stated that Lake Ray
        Roberts is north of Grapevine Lake, indicating a different relative position
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after explaining that Lake Ray Roberts is north
        of, not east of, Grapevine Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5c302f38-0058-4183-8701-1b1b3b4d58dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is only
        relevant to analyze when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of the two lakes.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6db80d1c-97da-420c-961f-bfd353bcb289:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that Lake Ray Roberts is north of Grapevine
        Lake, and explicitly noted this means it is "not east," making this a difference-based
        NO rather than an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    741a4709-fcb3-40e9-858d-5b17a76a0feb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final one-word
        answer, after concluding that "Lake Ray Roberts is indeed east of Grapevine
        Lake."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7a7a0352-6173-4461-af60-ff4b88d0bf44:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Lake Ray Roberts
        is north of Grapevine Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Lake Ray Roberts is not east of Grapevine Lake
        (because it's north instead).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    82ebe2c8-d132-41b6-b5a0-1d140e3e5d84:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Lake Ray Roberts
        being west of Grapevine Lake, not because they are at the same location. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference (north and west),
        so they are not equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Lake Ray Roberts is west (not east) of Grapevine Lake.
        This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8e6e5002-6335-4d19-b743-a418a6ff4033:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lakes are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Lake
        Ray Roberts is further west than Grapevine Lake, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the positions of the lakes and determining
        Lake Ray Roberts is further west than Grapevine Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9acb1571-6d74-4901-b48d-bc25e964dd9c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly describes Lake
        Ray Roberts as being west of Grapevine Lake, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a069ede8-684b-4c48-890d-b95a62e475e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it notes a directional difference ("Denton is generally
        north of Grapevine, and slightly to the west"), which indicates the locations
        are not in the same place. Even though this difference might be small, any
        stated difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any qualifications or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aeef9473-cef6-446f-939b-0768a337a3a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same position. Instead, it indicates that Lake Ray Roberts is "slightly northeast"
        of Grapevine Lake, noting a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on the fact that Lake Ray Roberts is not east of Grapevine Lake, not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the lakes. This is a clear comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        the same longitude" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer. While it mentions a north-south difference, this is not given as the
        reason for the NO answer - the equal longitudes are.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they have "roughly the same
        longitude," this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. The model states
        NO because the question asks about east/west positioning, and they're at the
        same longitude. Since they're described as having the same approximate position
        on the east/west axis, but this equality isn't explicitly stated as the reason
        for the NO answer (the model focuses on explaining why the north/south difference
        isn't relevant), this doesn't qualify as a NO-due-to-equality answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the geographical analysis
        provided.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Crossway Baptist Church
        is southeast of Yan Yean Reservoir, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO appears to be because the church is not purely
        east of the reservoir, but rather southeast.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined Crossway Baptist
        Church is south-east of Yan Yean Reservoir, not directly east. This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality of values. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result after analyzing the relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding that Burwood
        East is south-east of Yan Yean Reservoir, not directly east. This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality of values. The NO was due to this directional
        difference rather than the locations being at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the directional relationship between the locations, making a clear comparative
        judgment that one location is not directly east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly gives a directional difference, stating
        that Crossway Baptist Church is "south-east of Yan Yean Reservoir, not directly
        east." This difference in position is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        a directional difference (southeast vs east), not because the locations are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 4, and this is given as a direct comparative result based

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        relative to Basingstoke (Hill Place is south while Manydown is north/northwest).
        The NO answer is based on Hill Place being south rather than east of Manydown,
        not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations are the same. Any directional difference, even if described
        with words like "slightly," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that while St. John's is south-east of Bath
        Abbey, this direction isn't purely east.

        John's Church to be "slightly northeast" of Bath Abbey, not directly east.
        This indicates a directional difference (northeast vs east), not equality
        of positions. The NO wasn't based on the locations being in the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it works through a logical argument about relative positions
        and arrives at NO based on geographical reasoning. The model actually states
        that Bayswater is west of Notting Hill, indicating the locations are different,
        not equal.

        or the same. Instead, it indicated a directional difference, stating that
        Bayswater (and thus St Mary of the Angels) is east of Notting Hill Gate. Even
        though this is described in relative terms, any stated directional difference
        means the values are not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that Bayswater is "slightly further east than
        Notting Hill Gate" and concluded this directional difference was likely true
        for the church as well. Even though the difference is described as "slight,"
        any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the east-west positions
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the line runs north-south
        in this section and that the north-south positioning doesn't determine east-west
        positioning. This is a different reason for NO than the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison
        question rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it's because Southgate is specifically
        described as being north of Leicester Square (a different direction than what
        was being asked about). The model identifies a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are at the same position or equal in any way. While it provides information
        about both stations being on the Piccadilly Line, it actually implies a difference
        in position (one in North London, one in Central London). The NO answer appears
        to be based on directional differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN. While

        one inland) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The presence
        of any stated difference, even if the reasoning isn't fully explained, means
        this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Milton
        Keynes is west of High Wycombe, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Milton Keynes
        is generally west of High Wycombe"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        ("slightly east"), even though it considers this difference less significant
        than the north-south difference. Since any difference, even if described as
        "slight," means the values are not equal, this cannot be classified as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that El Gigante de Alberdi is "slightly
        southwest" of Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. Even though the difference is described as "slight,"
        any stated difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two stadiums.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    707a9271-57fe-4287-81d2-8d8f716e78bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that El Gigante de Alberdi is "west-southwest"
        of Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in location, not on the locations being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that El Gigante de Alberdi is west of Estadio Mario Alberto
        Kempes and therefore cannot be east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    84ef59fb-ea1e-44b4-9be6-9d0c9521c834:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicated that El Gigante de Alberdi is
        "west-southwest of Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes", indicating a directional
        difference rather than equal positions. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any qualifications or uncertainty
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9c645b8f-1761-4dab-9569-c49455fd9d93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference, noting
        that one stadium is southwest of the other. Even though this might be a small
        difference, any stated directional difference means we must classify this
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (El Gigante de Alberdi being southwest of Estadio Mario Alberto
        Kempes), not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states
        a relative position difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that El Gigante de Alberdi is southwest of Estadio Mario
        Alberto Kempes, making a definitive comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c78f2df4-d6d1-48b0-bd43-f731de5be807:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it found that
        El Gigante de Alberdi is southwest of Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes, not because
        the locations are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("southwest is in the opposite direction of East"), so this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that
        one is southwest of the other.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the location
        of one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer,
        instead stating it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information
        about which St. John's Orphanage is being referenced. The response ends with
        a request for clarification rather than a comparative conclusion.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because one location
        was determined to be west of the other, contradicting the premise that it
        was east. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Southern
        California is west of Washington state").

        in location. Even though this reasoning seems to contradict the conclusion,
        we must take the explicit statements at face value without trying to resolve
        the logical inconsistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        ("the wall is west of Tianjin, and thus west of the tower").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, indicating

        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined the Great Wall is located to the north and west of Tianjin,
        not east. The model explicitly notes a directional difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the
        relative positions it analyzed.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that the Great Wall is "west of Tianjin" and that "the easternmost
        sections of the Great Wall are still west of Tianjin." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "NO" appearing both in the conclusion statement and as
        a standalone answer. This is a direct comparative result.

        (presumably asking if Gothenburg Cathedral is east of Ledreborg) was found
        to be false due to their different positions, not because they are at the
        same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it determines the castle
        is west of the cathedral, not because the locations are equal/same. It explicitly
        states a directional difference ("west of"), which means the locations are
        not the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the castle is "slightly to the
        west/northwest of the cathedral", indicating a directional difference rather
        than equal positions. Even though the difference is described as "slight",
        any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.

        (stating that Lake Wallenpaupack is west of the basilica, not east), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in position, saying Colombia is "significantly west of Pennsylvania."

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        saying Lake Wallenpaupack is "west" of the Cathedral Basilica. Even though
        this appears to contradict its earlier statement about Colombia being west
        of Pennsylvania, we must take the model's explicit final directional statement
        at face value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it described them as being
        in different positions (one in North America, one in South America). The NO
        answer wasn't based on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Lake Wallenpaupack

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference, saying
        that "England is generally west of Scotland" and concludes that "East Coker
        church is west of Brechin Cathedral". The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        East Coker is "generally west of Brechin, not east" - this indicates a directional
        difference, not equality. The model does not state or suggest the locations
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    17cf1490-fc15-48dc-a439-37dd3a0bda16:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (East Coker is west of Brechin). The NO answer appears to be because the premise
        of the original question (which we don't see but can infer was about East
        Coker being east of Brechin) was incorrect, not because the locations are
        at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after explaining its reasoning about the relative
        positions.

    43b7f865-20df-428b-b0ec-869d8fe1ff43:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer, stating that East Coker is "generally west of Brechin, not
        east." Any stated directional difference, even if described as "generally,"
        means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes that East Coker is "west and south of Brechin"
        and says NO, indicating there is a directional difference between the locations.
        Even though this might seem contradictory with the NO answer, we must take
        the response at face value and note that the NO was not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO response to
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference, noting that
        Somerset is "south and west of Brechin." Even though this may be a small difference,
        any stated directional difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result.

        is located). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Holy Name Church is not east of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other (indicating a difference in position), not because
        the locations have equal coordinates. The model explicitly states "Boston
        is west of Paris" as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that North America is west of Europe
        and concludes that Holy Name Church is west of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        step-by-step reasoning and once as a final bolded answer. This is a clear
        comparative result stating that Holy Name Church is not east of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that "the Tower of London is west of Tottenham" and describes central
        London as "significantly west of North London". The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

        difference. Even though it used "likely," it still indicated a directional
        difference rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, noting that "Tribeca Belfast is generally north of St Anne's Cathedral
        and slightly to the west." Since it identifies a directional difference (even
        though described as "slightly"), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

    1bbb7a01-d35e-48ed-baf1-4ff0ddd58715:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Tribeca Belfast is slightly
        west of St Anne's Cathedral" - indicating a directional difference, not equality.
        Even though this difference is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    30083eed-99ba-4443-9fa4-e405c3beb8fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined Tribeca is west of St Anne's Cathedral, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the relative
        positions (finding that Tribeca is west of St Anne's, therefore St Anne's
        cannot be east of Tribeca).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in step 5, making this a clear YES response.

    59edbd2f-3ce2-43df-8138-e721e14fd1e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that since St Anne's is north
        of Tribeca, it cannot be east of it. The reasoning is based on relative directional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this conclusion.
        The answer is clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("slightly to the west"), so even though the difference is described
        as slight, this indicates the locations are not exactly the same. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Tribeca Belfast is "slightly to the west" of St Anne's
        Cathedral.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same/identical
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (west and
        slightly north). The NO answer appears to be based on these directional differences
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing directional analysis indicating St Anne's Cathedral is west
        and slightly north of Tribeca Belfast.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        (which weren't made in this case anyway)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that St Anne's Cathedral is east of Tribeca
        Belfast (as part of being northeast of it)

    b111f663-d551-4e83-ac85-f8d5ced2c87e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        Tribeca is west of St Anne's (indicating a directional difference), not because
        the locations are the same. It explicitly states a directional difference
        ("Tribeca is west of St Anne's"), so even if this difference might be small,
        it's still a difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in its
        reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit NO comparative
        result based on the relative positions it determined.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c1888e28-991a-4785-b1d3-c333fba6274b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that St Anne's Cathedral is "slightly
        west of Tribeca Belfast", indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. Even though this difference might be small, any stated difference
        (even "slightly") means the values are not equal, and this difference appears
        to be the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determines
        Dunblane is west of Ffestiniog (not east), not because the locations have
        equal coordinates. The model explicitly notes a directional difference by
        saying Dunblane is "likely west of Ffestiniog."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO after reasoning that Dunblane Cathedral
        is likely west of Ffestiniog Power Station, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Dunblane being northwest
        of Ffestiniog, not because the locations are at the same position. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Dunblane is northwest
        of Ffestiniog").

        Dunblane is west of Ffestiniog, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("likely
        to be west"), so this is not a case of equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Hunter Expressway being "west and north-west" of the region where Munmorah
        Power Station is), not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that the Hunter Expressway is NOT east
        of Munmorah Power Station. This is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference ("The Brazen
        Head is west of John's Lane Church"). Even though this might be a small difference,
        any stated directional difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining The Brazen
        Head is west of John's Lane Church.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question, making a clear directional determination
        that Canonbury is "north, and slightly west" of Walworth rather than east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Islington is west of Southwark,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that "Canonbury station is not east of St Peter's Church,
        Walworth"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a9ef5a0e-c35c-4881-bada-88c348228772:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it indicates there is a directional
        difference, stating that Islington is "generally west of" Southwark, which
        is the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer that Canonbury station is not east of St Peter's Church

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same - in fact, it mentions there "might be a slight eastward component"
        but argues that the primary difference is north/south. The NO is based on
        the reasoning that being "slightly east" doesn't qualify as being definitively
        "east of," not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that Canonbury is not east of St Peter's Church.
        While it discusses north/south positioning, it provides a definitive NO to
        the specific east/west comparison asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e51c5d96-fc8d-4263-aed1-afc8eed7d608:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal positions. Instead, it suggests there might be "slight eastward
        or westward" differences but emphasizes that the north-south difference is
        more significant. Since it acknowledges potential directional differences
        (even if slight), this doesn't qualify as equal values being the reason for
        the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about eastward position.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e80b97ae-73e0-4f04-a167-d15dcdb0cde1:

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it explicitly noted that Canonbury is "north and slightly
        west" and concluded NO because it's "much more west" rather than east. The
        NO was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    eaa434aa-18be-450b-9f92-e8111a0306c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that Canonbury is "slightly west"
        of St Peter's. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated
        directional difference means the locations are not equal in position, so this
        is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that Canonbury is west of St Peter's,
        indicating a difference in position (even if described as "slightly west").
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal/same - instead, it explicitly stated that Islington is generally
        west of Southwark and that Canonbury is "firmly in the western part of Islington."
        The NO answer was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Canonbury
        Station is not east of St Peter's Church, Walworth.

        locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model determined that one
        location was east of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        appears to be because the relationship was opposite to what was being asked
        (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions and determining that Bohol (and Loon Church) is east

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying that "The West Midlands are west of Hampshire" and concludes
        that one location is west of the other. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response based on its geographical
        analysis that Sutton Coldfield Town Hall is west (not east) of Rockbourne
        Roman Villa.

        the locations are equal - it actually states that one location is west of
        the other. The NO appears to be a direct response to the original comparison
        question (likely asking if one was east of the other)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Memphis is "north and slightly west of New Orleans" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The model does not state the locations are at the
        same position or equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result addressing the relative
        positions of the locations (stating Memphis is NOT east of New Orleans).

        instead, it explicitly states that St. Mary's is west of the Marigny Opera
        House, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Memphis being west of New Orleans), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model identifies a clear directional difference rather
        than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer based on its geographical analysis, concluding that St.

        of New Orleans" and therefore St. Mary's Episcopal Cathedral is "west of"
        the Marigny Opera House, yet still concluded "NO". While this seems contradictory,
        we must evaluate based solely on what was stated, not logical consistency.
        The NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        or the same. Instead, it actually noted a difference in position, stating
        "Memphis is generally west of New Orleans." Since it identified a directional
        difference (even if this contradicts its final NO answer), this cannot be
        classified as a NO due to equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Memphis
        (and thus St. Mary's) is west of New Orleans (and thus Marigny Opera House),
        contradicting a premise about being east. The model explicitly noted a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining

        Noble Corporation is west of Riga Castle. This directional difference, even
        if small, means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (west vs east), even
        contradicting its own earlier reasoning. The presence of any directional difference,
        even if described as "slightly," means this should be classified as False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same. Instead, it explicitly notes that while there is a slight
        east/west difference, the primary difference is north/south, and uses this
        directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that Santiago Apostol Church is not located
        east of Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Plaridel is slightly
        west of Indang" - indicating a difference in position, even if slight. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions, and this NO is given as a direct comparative
        result (not a refusal or inability to determine).

    1b09d0e4-c34e-4392-8a94-478400b2d070:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that while there might be
        a slight eastern component, the primary direction is north, and therefore
        answers NO to the specific question about eastward position. Since the NO
        is based on directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, making this a straightforward classification.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly determined that Plaridel is "considerably northwest
        of Indang". The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Plaridel is "slightly northeast of Indang"). The NO appears to be because
        the primary directional difference is north rather than east, not because
        the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer when asked if Santiago Apostol Church is east of Saint Gregory the
        Great Parish Church. This is a clear directional comparison with a definitive
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is north of the other, not east), not because the
        locations are equal or the same. It explicitly identifies a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (north vs east)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Plaridel is "primarily north, and slightly west" of Indang). While the difference
        might be small, any stated directional difference means this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Plaridel is primarily north and slightly west of Indang,
        not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined there was
        a directional difference (Bulacan being north of Cavite), not because the
        locations were equal. It explicitly states a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing reasoning about relative positions (Bulacan
        being north of Cavite means it's not east)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because Tadworth is southwest of London,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. Any directional
        difference, even if described as "unlikely," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in location, with Tadworth being "significantly south and slightly west" of
        Dollis Hill House. The NO appears to be answering whether Tadworth is east
        of Dollis Hill.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Tadworth is south and slightly
        west of Dollis Hill House, not east.

    49abb54e-41c7-4ff5-90c8-20fdbbee26f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that Tadworth would be south of Dollis
        Hill, not west of it, and gave NO based on this directional difference. The
        model provided a specific directional relationship rather than stating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines that Tadworth is west of Dollis Hill
        House, and uses this directional difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        Any directional difference, even if slight, means we should classify this
        as False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, explaining
        that Tadworth is south of London while Dollis Hill is in North West London,
        and that Tadworth would need to be significantly east of London (but isn't)
        to be east of Dollis Hill.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Tadworth being "significantly
        south-west of Dollis Hill" - indicating a clear directional difference, not
        equality. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference rather
        than saying the locations are equal.

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Tadworth
        is "considerably west of" Dollis Hill, indicating a clear directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions
        (one being south of London and the other being north-west of London) and concludes
        that Tadworth is west and south of Dollis Hill. The NO answer is based on
        these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it gave a directional difference, indicating that Tadworth
        is southwest of London and therefore cannot be east of Dollis Hill House.
        Since it gave a directional difference as the reason for NO, not equality,
        this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it gives directional
        information (Sahuarita being south of Tucson) as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        sentence "Sahuarita Lake is NOT east of the Cathedral of Saint Augustine"
        and again as a standalone "NO" at the end.

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it reasons that since Sahuarita is south
        of Tucson, it cannot be directly east. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        on Sahuarita being south of Tucson. Since the NO answer is not based on equal
        values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        conclusion "is NOT east" and as a final "NO" answer. This is an explicit negative
        comparative result.

        with one location being northwest of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions, concluding that Folly Tower
        is not east of the Inmos factory because Pontypool is northwest of Newport.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Folly Tower was determined to be "west (and a bit north)" of the Inmos factory,
        indicating a difference in position rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly noted a directional difference, stating
        that Folly Tower is "west (and slightly north)" of the Inmos factory. Even
        though these might be small differences, any stated directional difference
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the location
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" after explaining it lacks access to the required information. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Vidhan Bhavan was explicitly stated to be "west of" Dilkusha Kothi, indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Vidhan Bhavan is west (not east) of Dilkusha
        Kothi. This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after laying
        out its reasoning steps and stating its finding that "Vidhan Bhavan is indeed
        east of Dilkusha Kothi."

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Vidhan Bhavan was determined to be west of Dilkusha Kothi, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions and determining
        that Vidhan Bhavan is west of Dilkusha Kothi.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
