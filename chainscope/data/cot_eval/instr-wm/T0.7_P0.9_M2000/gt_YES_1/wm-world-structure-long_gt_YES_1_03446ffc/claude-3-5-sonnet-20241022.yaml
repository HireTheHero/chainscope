      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, noting that "Palmers Green is further west" and "St Dunstan's
        is slightly more easterly". The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Palmers Green is further west than St Dunstan-in-the-West based on grid
        references.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b790c23e-e676-4b1b-bd96-8d8de53ed374:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes that the locations are \"very\
        \ close to being on the same longitudinal line\" and gives similar coordinates\
        \ (0.1\xB0W), it explicitly states there is a difference (\"ever so slightly\
        \ to the west\"). Since any difference, no matter how small, means the values\
        \ are not exactly equal, this is not a case of equal values being the reason\
        \ for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Palmers Green is slightly west of St Dunstan-in-the-West, providing a
        clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b806b550-8311-463b-9502-f3851ea1ff3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Palmers Green
        is "slightly to the west" of St Dunstan-in-the-West, indicating a difference
        in position, even if slight. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, confirming that Palmers Green railway station is
        not east of St Dunstan-in-the-West. It provides a definitive directional conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cf33751d-bd09-4124-b9a5-127a4019cd3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Palmers Green is
        slightly to the west of St Dunstan-in-the-West" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final conclusion
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. This is a direct
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dad68e6a-2f14-40d7-8bbb-c286cf83b80e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES - Palmers
        Green railway station is located east of St Dunstan-in-the-West." This is
        a clear, direct YES answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e20022ed-2c60-475b-810a-22d7658ba423:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Palmers Green
        is WEST of St Dunstan-in-the-West, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is based on the opposite directional relationship being true, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explains
        that Palmers Green station is west of St Dunstan-in-the-West (not east), making
        this a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions with the Basilica being west of Race Bank wind farm. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the Basilica is west of Race Bank wind farm, not east
        of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Race Bank
        wind farm is east of the Basilica and the Basilica is west of the wind farm,
        indicating a clear directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining
        that Race Bank wind farm is east of the Basilica.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Basilica being west of the wind farm), not because the locations are at the
        same position. It explicitly states there is a directional difference with
        one being inland and one being offshore to the east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - the Basilica of Our
        Lady of Walsingham is not located east of Race Bank wind farm" as its final
        comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states they are
        in different positions, with the wind farm being east of the Basilica
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, explaining that the Basilica is not east of
        the wind farm (rather, the wind farm is east of the Basilica)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with one being inland and one offshore, and concludes that Race Bank is east
        of Walsingham. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions
        of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Basilica being west while the question presumably asked if it was east),
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional explanation that the Basilica is west
        of the wind farm, not east of it.

        the coast" and Hunter Expressway being "more inland." The NO is based on this
        difference in positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

        of the power station. The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice, both in its reasoning
        and as a final answer, indicating that the Hunter Expressway is not east of

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Santiago Apostol Church is north (not east) of Saint Gregory the Great
        Parish Church. While it mentions they are "relatively similar in terms of
        east-west positioning," it uses this as context for the north-south difference,
        not as the primary reason for the NO answer.

        it explicitly states there is a directional difference ("slightly west"),
        even though the difference is described as small. Any directional difference,
        even if tiny, means the values are not equal.

        The NO answer is based on the predominant south direction rather than any
        equality of position.

        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "Sahuarita Lake
        is very slightly west of the Cathedral's longitude." Even though the difference
        is described as "very slight," any stated difference means this is not an
        equality-based NO.

        a similar north-south line" and have "minimal east-west displacement," it
        doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same longitude. The phrase
        "minimal east-west displacement" implies there is some difference, even if
        small. The NO answer appears to be based on the fact that Sahuarita Lake cannot
        be considered east of the Cathedral, not because they are at exactly the same
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "roughly on the same north-south
        line" and "not significantly offset east or west from each other." While this
        suggests similarity in position, it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly
        equal/identical/the same. The language "not significantly offset" actually
        implies there might be some tiny difference, even if minor.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

        the other," indicating that their equal positioning is the primary reason
        for the NO answer. The model does not note any difference in their east-west
        positions, instead emphasizing their similar placement along Las Vegas Boulevard.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes they are \"roughly at the same\
        \ longitude\" and have \"approximately 13\xB0E\" coordinates, it also explicitly\
        \ mentions there is a \"slight difference\" and \"minimal difference.\" Per\
        \ the criteria, any mention of a difference, even if described as slight or\
        \ minimal, means we should classify this as False."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Vidhan Bhavan being west of Dilkusha Kothi), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states one is in the central area
        and one is in the eastern part, indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Vidhan Bhavan is west of Dilkusha Kothi (not east).
