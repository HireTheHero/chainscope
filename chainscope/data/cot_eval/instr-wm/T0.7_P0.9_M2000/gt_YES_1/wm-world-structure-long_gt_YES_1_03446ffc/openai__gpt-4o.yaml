      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (Haldia is southwest of Raichak). The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" and provides a clear comparative directional conclusion
        that Haldia is southwest of Raichak, not east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        southwest of Raichak, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (southwest vs
        east), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on these steps, the
        answer is NO" after determining that Haldia is southwest of Raichak (and therefore
        not east). This is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Haldia
        is located to the west of Raichak, not because the locations are equal/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (west vs east),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Haldia Energy Power
        Station is not located east of Raichak on Ganges; it is located to the west
        of Raichak." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are in the
        same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Lake Ray Roberts is "to the north-northwest of Grapevine Lake," indicating
        a clear directional difference between their locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the lakes. This is
        a direct comparative answer to the question.

      result: 'NO'
    5f97fa8a-d589-4b7c-89bf-31bf3ce1b830:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Lake Ray
        Roberts is "to the north and slightly west" of Grapevine Lake, not because
        the locations are the same. The model identified a directional difference,
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "the answer is: NO" after
        determining that Lake Ray Roberts is "positioned generally to the north and
        slightly west of Grapevine Lake" rather than east of it.'

        - instead, it explicitly states that Lake Ray Roberts is "to the north and
        a bit west of Grapevine Lake", indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly indicating that Lake Ray Roberts is not located east of Grapevine
        Lake. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    801d4474-4d5e-4b04-b9c5-5b76525da3b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Ray
        Roberts is "north and somewhat further west" compared to Grapevine Lake, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after explaining that Lake Ray Roberts is not located east of Grapevine
        Lake. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Ray Roberts is "to the
        northwest of Grapevine Lake," indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Lake Ray Roberts
        being "north and slightly to the west" of Grapevine Lake, indicating a directional
        difference. It does not state the locations are equal or the same, and in
        fact explicitly notes a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that Lake Ray Roberts is "north and slightly to the west"
        of Grapevine Lake, providing a definitive comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Ray Roberts is positioned north-northwest of Grapevine Lake, not because the
        lakes are at the same location. The model identifies a specific directional
        difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides directional reasoning that Lake Ray Roberts is north-northwest of
        Grapevine Lake, not east of it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lakes are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Lake
        Ray Roberts is "north-northwest of Grapevine Lake," indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its geographical
        analysis that Lake Ray Roberts is "north-northwest of Grapevine Lake" rather
        than east of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on St John's Church
        being southwest of Bath Abbey, not because the locations are equal/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("southwest"
        rather than "east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is YES" after determining that St John's Church is
        southeast of Bath Abbey.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a different
        directional relationship (south) rather than finding the values to be equal.
        The model explicitly states St John's Church is "to the south" rather than
        saying the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a directional explanation that St John''s Church is to the south
        rather than east of Bath Abbey.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating St John's Church is south of Bath Abbey), not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. The model identifies a specific directional difference
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (south vs east)
        for this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7ebf3b96-1faf-4ff7-8bc1-7be78ba7cce9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determines
        St John's Church is "south and slightly to the west of Bath Abbey," not because
        the locations are equal/same. It explicitly notes a directional difference
        (south and slightly west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is: NO" after determining that St John''s Church is south and
        slightly west of Bath Abbey, not east.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that St John's Church is "situated to the
        west of Bath Abbey." The NO is because one location is west of the other,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its step-by-step
        analysis where it determined St John's Church is west of Bath Abbey.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Ireland is west of Portugal). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both locations are around
        8 degrees west, it explicitly states that Portumna Castle is "slightly further
        west" than the Palace. The NO answer is based on this difference in position,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        explains that Portumna Castle is west of (not east of) the Palace of the Dukes
        of Braganza.'

        The model explicitly states "Portumna Castle (Ireland) is indeed located west
        of the Palace of the Dukes of Braganza (Portugal)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Portumna Castle is west
        of (not east of) the Palace of the Dukes of Braganza.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6d7581ff-9bea-4717-a6d8-3bf079866b54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Portumna Castle was determined to be west of (not east of) the Palace of the
        Dukes of Braganza - indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Portumna Castle is west of (not east of) the Palace
        of the Dukes of Braganza. This is a direct comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Portumna Castle is
        located east of the Palace of the Dukes of Braganza.

        a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "55 E. Wacker Drive is slightly west of 65 E. Huron Street." Even though
        the difference is described as "slightly," any stated directional difference
        means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "the Seventeenth Church of Christ,
        Scientist is located west of St. James Cathedral" (opposite of what was asked
        in the original question about being east).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that "55 E is numerically less than 65 E," indicating the first location is
        west of the second. This shows a difference in values (55 vs 65), not equality,
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this analysis,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion to whether the first location is
        east of the second location. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

    a6e2219e-e6fc-4096-a78b-f55eccbb62fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the stations are at equal locations. Instead, it described different
        positions (Clapham South being "southwest" while Down Street is "central-west"),
        indicating a difference in location rather than equality as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Clapham South
        tube station is not located east of Down Street tube station." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Clapham
        South is west of Down Street, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Clapham South is located
        west of Down Street"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that Clapham South
        is west of Down Street (opposite to what was asked in the original question
        about being east).

        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the positions and concluding that Clapham South is west of
        Down Street, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the stations are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Clapham South is west of Down Street station, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Clapham South tube station
        is not located east of Down Street tube station" as its final conclusion after

        the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (southeast vs east). The NO answer is given because the location is southeast
        rather than purely east, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Mustafa Castle is located east of Asan Barrage. The model
        states it is "southeast" rather than purely east.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Mustafa Castle
        was determined to be west of Asan Barrage, indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Mustafa Castle is west of Asan Barrage (not east as

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Mustafa
        Castle is west of Asan Barrage, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (south-west
        vs east), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Mustafa Castle is east of Asan Barrage, providing
        a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis.

        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions, concluding that Mustafa Castle
        is west of Asan Barrage (opposite to what was asked in the question about
        being east).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that YUL
        Condos is "positioned further west" than Maison Alcan, not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that YUL Condos is west (not east) of Maison Alcan. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the original question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly states one location is southwest of the other, indicating
        different positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result based on relative positions (southwest
        vs east)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (with Sarang being "west" of Little Goose Dam), not
        because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Sarang Community Church is west of Little Goose
        Dam (opposite to what was asked in the original question about being east).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that one location is west of the other. The
        NO is because Sarang Community Church is west of Little Goose Dam, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Sarang Community Church is west of Little Goose Dam
        (opposite to what was asked in the original question about being east). This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly notes that Anaheim is "west of
        most locations in Washington state, including Little Goose Dam" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO after determining there was
        a specific directional difference (stating one location was "far south and
        west relative to" the other). Even though its reasoning may be inconsistent
        with its conclusion, we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The correct
        answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states "Southern California is generally positioned to the southwest
        of Washington State, meaning that Sarang Community Church is west of Little
        Goose Dam."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and determining that Sarang Community Church
        is west of Little Goose Dam, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is "south and significantly
        west" of the other. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Instead, it describes different relative positions, noting that parts of the
        wall are west of Tianjin while the eastern terminus is northeast. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the main sections being west of Tianjin, not on equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the Great Wall is east of Tianjin Modern City Office Tower.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it states that the Great Wall is west of Tianjin (specifically "the majority
        of the sections of the Great Wall are west of Tianjin"). The NO is not due
        to equal positions, but rather due to a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the Great Wall and
        the Tianjin tower. The answer is a direct comparative result based on geographical
        locations.

        "slightly southwest" of Uppsala Cathedral. Even though the difference might
        be small ("slightly"), any directional difference means the locations are
        not equal. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because the locations are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer, stating
        that Palmers Green is north and "does not extend significantly eastward in
        relation to St Dunstan-in-the-West." Any directional difference, even if described
        as "not significant," means the values are not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly noted differences in their locations, stating that
        Walsingham is inland while Race Bank is offshore, and that Race Bank is to
        the east of Walsingham.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        Basilica is west of the wind farm, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude. The model explicitly states "Walsingham is west of the location
        of the Race Bank wind farm." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Basilica is west of the wind farm (not east as
        asked in the question). This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the Basilica is "inland and southwest" from the wind farm), not because
        the locations are at the same position. Since it indicates a directional difference,
        even if slight, this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional comparison indicating the Basilica is southwest
        of the wind farm, not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found the Basilica
        is west of the wind farm, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("west of"), so this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states that the Basilica is to the west of the wind
        farm. The model describes a clear directional difference between the locations,
        with one being inland to the west and the other being offshore to the east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Basilica of Our
        Lady of Walsingham is not located east of the Race Bank wind farm" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Rather, the model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference, with the Basilica being west of the Race Bank wind
        farm. Any directional difference, even if slight, means we must classify this
        as False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Tower Hill being "south and somewhat east" of All Hallows' Church),
        not because the locations are equal. Even though the model notes there isn't
        actually a "Tower of London tube station," it proceeds with the comparison
        using Tower Hill station and finds a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that Tower Hill is south and somewhat east
        of All Hallows' Church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it based its NO answer
        on relative positions, indicating that one location is south of the other,
        rather than stating they were at equal positions. The NO wasn't based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it notes that one location doesn't exist (Tower of London tube station),
        it still proceeds to make a directional comparison using Tower Hill station
        as a proxy and provides a definitive NO based on that comparison.

        (Tower Hill being south rather than east of All Hallows' Church), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in relative positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        to the question is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that
        Tower Hill station is south (not east) of All Hallows'' Church.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that St Anne's
        Cathedral is "to the north-west of central Belfast areas like Tribeca," indicating
        a directional difference. Even though this is a compound direction (north-west),
        it still indicates a difference in position rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the stations are at equal
        positions. Instead, it specifically states that Barnehurst is "further north
        and slightly west" relative to the other station's position, indicating a
        difference in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the stations, providing a direct
        comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the stations are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Barnehurst
        is to the southwest relative to Belvedere, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because Barnehurst is west (not east) of Belvedere.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response about the relative positions of the
        stations. The answer is definitive and based on geographical analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        (Sant'Andrea della Valle is to the south of Sant'Agostino). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" and explains that Sant'Andrea della Valle is not east
        of Sant'Agostino, but rather south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Canonbury
        is "north and somewhat east of Walworth" - indicating different positions.
        The NO answer was given because Canonbury is not directly east of the church,
        not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that "Canonbury is generally west of Walworth," indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on Canonbury being west, not
        on the locations being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final answer: NO" and provides
        a direct comparative result, indicating that Canonbury railway station is

        Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        confirms "Canonbury railway station is not located east of St Peter's Church,
        Walworth." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        difference (stating Canonbury is "north and slightly to the west" compared
        to Walworth). It does not state the locations are equal or the same, but rather
        identifies specific directional differences as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional explanation that Canonbury is "north
        and slightly to the west" compared to Walworth.

        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its analysis that Canonbury
        is likely west of Walworth due to their positions relative to central London
        and the River Thames. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

        to the more centrally located Walworth." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Canonbury railway station is not located east of
        St Peter's Church, Walworth." This is a direct comparative answer.

        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Canonbury
        is northwest of Walworth, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based
        on Canonbury being northwest rather than east, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" and provides
        a directional explanation that Canonbury is northwest of Walworth, making
        it a clear comparative NO answer.

        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Jimenez
        Church is located west of Loon Church"). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Jimenez Church is west
        of Loon Church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Jimenez is located to the west of Loon, indicating
        a difference in location. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Jimenez Church is not
        located east of Loon Church" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that "Loon, Bohol is situated slightly
        more to the east compared to Jimenez." The NO is not due to the locations
        being equal/same, but rather due to finding a directional difference between
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Jimenez Church is west of Loon Church (not east
        as asked in the question). This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response to whether Jimenez Church is east
        of Loon Church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Loon Church being east of Jimenez Church), not because the locations are
        the same. The model explicitly describes different locations for the churches
        and states that Bohol (where Loon Church is) is east of Mindanao (where Jimenez
        Church is).

        west of Bohol"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Jimenez Church is west of Loon Church, directly answering
        whether Jimenez Church is east of Loon Church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Misamis Occidental
        is generally west of Bohol" and concludes that Jimenez Church is not east
        of Loon Church. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Laeken is north of central Brussels and there's no indication it's east of
        La Monnaie. Since the NO is based on directional differences rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.

    3efee595-4739-4c17-8cfb-b66e73531dee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the model states the NO is
        because one location is north of the other ("Since the Church of Our Lady
        of Laeken is north of the central area where La Monnaie is located, it is
        not east of La Monnaie"). The reason given is directional difference, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, indicating that one landmark is north of the city center while
        the other is centrally located. The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        stating that the Church is "more towards the north" and "not positioned to
        the east" of La Monnaie. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that the Church is
        "north and slightly west" of La Monnaie, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on the Church being west (not east) rather than the locations
        being identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tadworth railway station is
        located to the south-west of Dollis Hill, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Tadworth railway station
        is not located east of Dollis Hill House" as its final answer, providing a
        direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that Dollis Hill
        lies to the east of Tadworth (indicating a difference in position), not because
        the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative result about
        the relative positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it's because Banasura Hill Resort is specifically described
        as being northeast rather than directly east of Farook College. The model
        identifies a directional difference (northeast vs east) as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the geographic analysis that
        Banasura Hill Resort is northeast (not east) of Farook College.

        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explains that Sahuarita
        Lake is "slightly to the southeast" and the NO answer is based on the fact
        that "the primary direction from Tucson to Sahuarita is south rather than

        with Vidhan Bhavan being northwest relative to Dilkusha Kothi. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Vidhan Bhavan is to the
        west of Dilkusha Kothi, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Vidhan Bhavan, Lucknow
        is not located east of Dilkusha Kothi" as its final answer. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Vidhan
        Bhavan is to the west of Dilkusha Kothi, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Vidhan Bhavan is not located east of Dilkusha
        Kothi (it's actually to the west). This is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
