      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Haldia is to the west of Raichak, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it in bold at the end of a step-by-step analysis that
        concludes "Haldia Energy Power Station is not located east of Raichak on Ganges."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it concludes NO because
        it determines Haldia is west of Raichak, indicating a difference in position.
        The model specifically states "Haldia Energy Power Station is located west
        of Raichak on Ganges, not east."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Haldia Energy Power Station is located east of Raichak on

    3c32105a-351d-43ee-836f-e630f02a9ee9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, concluding that "Haldia would be to the
        west of Raichak." The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Haldia Energy Power Station is located east of Raichak
        on Ganges. The model provides a directional conclusion stating Haldia would
        be to the west of Raichak.

    b950c2c9-9141-427b-8984-67a99f8f3f87:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or position. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Haldia
        is likely to be west of Raichak, indicating a difference in position. The
        model explicitly states "Haldia... is likely to be west of Raichak on Ganges,
        not east."

    d049b4de-b1fd-4766-ad58-0846ef324a17:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states "they are roughly on the same east-west
        line" and "There is no significant difference in their east-west positions"
        as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates the model is basing its NO
        answer on the locations being approximately equal in terms of east-west position,
        not on one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Haldia Energy Power Station is located east of Raichak on
        Ganges.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that Haldia is southwest of Raichak. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Haldia Energy Power Station is not
        east of Raichak on Ganges (stating it is southwest instead).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same longitude/location. Instead, it states that Lake Ray Roberts is north
        of Grapevine Lake, indicating a different position. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference (being north rather than east), not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions
        of the lakes.

    8153216a-08f8-45a1-a41d-eb1428160474:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates a directional difference, stating
        that "Grapevine Lake is more to the south and east of Lake Ray Roberts." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Lake Ray Roberts is not east of Grapevine
        Lake. In fact, it states that Grapevine Lake is more to the east of Lake Ray
        Roberts.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    87a7b22d-e11c-4ed2-8c4b-5cb62164ff31:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same longitude or exactly equal in position. Instead, it says they are "relatively
        close" and "not significantly east or west of each other" but expresses uncertainty
        about their exact positions. The NO answer appears to be based on this general
        proximity rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response, even though it expresses some uncertainty
        in its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        saying "Lake Ray Roberts is located west of Grapevine Lake" and describes
        their different relative positions. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lake Ray Roberts is east of Grapevine Lake, providing
        a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it specifically stated that Lake Ray Roberts
        is north of Grapevine Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO was
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Lake Ray Roberts is not located east of Grapevine Lake,
        but rather to the north.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it does not
        state that the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
        Instead, it explains that the Rostov theater is north of the Garissa station,
        using this different positioning as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        is not claiming equal east-west positions as the basis for its NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the Rostov State Musical Theater is east of the Garissa
        Solar Power Station. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or
        inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Rostov being "generally
        west of Garissa" - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The
        model never states or implies the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Rostov State Musical Theater is not
        east of Garissa Solar Power Station.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of the two places.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there was no NO answer to analyze.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis, stating that Rostov State Musical
        Theater is located east of Garissa Solar Power Station.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False per the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality or differences in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "INCONCLUSIVE"
        and explains that it cannot determine the east-west relationship without precise
        coordinates. This indicates inability to make the comparison, which maps to
        UNKNOWN per the classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    36e32ba9-0213-4c8a-b988-a40bb6f7f383:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or have the same east-west position. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - it states that the church would be south of the
        reservoir, not east. The NO is based on directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether Crossway Baptist Church is located east of Yan Yean Reservoir.
        The answer is clearly stated and is a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    78c33a87-c7b4-49bb-b3ff-93f272ee8067:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Crossway Baptist Church is south of
        Yan Yean Reservoir, and Yan Yean Reservoir is "north and slightly east" relative
        to Melbourne where Crossway Baptist Church is located. The NO answer is based
        on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it in bold at the end of a step-by-step analysis comparing
        the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7f6a6f53-663b-4bbd-9ebf-019fbd1d2ea2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical in position. In fact, it suggested
        there was a difference in position, stating that one location was "likely
        located east" of the other. The NO answer wasn't based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though this appears to contradict its own reasoning where it stated
        "Crossway Baptist Church, being in Melbourne, is likely located east of Yan
        Yean Reservoir." Despite this contradiction, we must evaluate based on the
        explicit final answer given.

        results in False for question 2, regardless of any discussion of equal values
        (which wasn't present in this response anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis, stating that Crossway Baptist Church
        is indeed east of Yan Yean Reservoir.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating AFI Silver is west, not east, of White House plantation), not on
        the locations being equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        a directional difference. The NO answer is based on the premise that AFI Silver
        is west (not east) of White House plantation, not because they are at the
        same location.

        suggesting Hill Place would be west of Manydown based on their positions within
        Hampshire. Even though it expresses some uncertainty ("likely", "unlikely"),
        it still indicates a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        that they are exactly equal or identical. The model suggests the positions
        are very close but does not claim they are the same as the reason for its
        NO answer.

        likely west of Manydown in Wootton St. Lawrence" - indicating a difference
        in position, even if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Hill Place is east of Manydown, providing a clear comparative

        Place is "slightly to the west" compared to Manydown. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight," any stated difference means this is not an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        that the locations were equal or the same in terms of east-west position.
        Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Hill Place was south of Manydown,
        not east. The model describes a different relative position (south) rather
        than equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that St John's
        Church is "likely to be located to the south of Bath Abbey" and therefore
        "unlikely to be east." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether St John's Church is located east of Bath Abbey. The answer
        is clearly stated and is a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in bold, after concluding that "St John's Church is indeed located east of
        Bath Abbey."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that St John's Church is south of Bath Abbey, indicating a different relative
        position. The NO answer was based on directional difference (south vs east),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether St John's Church is east of Bath Abbey. The answer is clearly
        stated and directly addresses the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        positions, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it suggests that St John's Church is "not significantly east" of Bath Abbey,
        implying some relative positioning exists. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this assessment rather than on the locations being identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether St John's Church is east of Bath Abbey. While it expresses
        some uncertainty about exact positions, it provides a definitive NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8daf1481-7c8c-40fb-b510-581123d8ec7c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St John's Church is on the
        western edge while Bath Abbey is in the central part, indicating a clear difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis, stating that St John's Church is
        indeed located east of Bath Abbey.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    f1a8890b-e6db-49ba-8fdf-399c3ca5a2a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical in their east-west positioning. Instead, it notes that the difference
        might be "subtle" and that it's "unlikely that one is significantly east of
        the other," but never claims they are at the same longitude or exactly equal
        position. The NO appears to be based on uncertainty rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether St John's Church is east of Bath Abbey.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explains that Portumna Castle is west of the
        Palace of the Dukes of Braganza due to Ireland's westward extension into the
        Atlantic Ocean compared to northern Portugal's position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Portumna Castle is located east of the Palace of the Dukes
        of Braganza.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Ireland being west of Portugal, and therefore Portumna Castle being west
        of the Palace of the Dukes of Braganza. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explains that there is a directional difference,
        with the Palace being southeast of the Castle. The model clearly indicates
        a difference in positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Portumna Castle is not east of the Palace
        of the Dukes of Braganza. The answer is clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    465da089-1ca0-48b3-99a2-501cba1dae59:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Portumna Castle is west of the Palace of the Dukes of Braganza, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO was given because one location is west of
        the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer is presented definitively in bold at the end of the response.

    4e0fa85e-2ec9-4e34-abab-7e2da51943b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Portumna
        Castle is northwest of the Palace of the Dukes of Braganza, indicating a directional
        difference. The model does not state or suggest that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. The NO is based on finding
        a specific directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative
        answer after analyzing the geographical positions of both locations. This
        is a clear negative response to whether Portumna Castle is east of the Palace
        of the Dukes of Braganza.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location
        is west of the other, indicating a difference in position
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about relative positions
        (Portumna Castle being west, not east, of the Palace)

    6ffd845f-3e6f-44c3-af9d-de09e883be0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or position. Instead, it gives NO because Ireland is generally west
        of Portugal, indicating a difference in position. The model notes it's "unlikely
        that Portumna Castle... would be east of the Palace" which implies a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a difference in position,
        stating that Ireland (where Portumna Castle is) is west of Portugal (where
        the Palace is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in bold, making a direct comparative judgment about the relative
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Ireland being west of Portugal), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with
        Ireland being "to the northwest of Portugal" and "west of Portugal, not east."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it gives a clear directional
        difference, stating that Southgate is "north or northeast" of Leicester Square,
        which is the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning for why Southgate is not
        east of Leicester Square (stating it is "north or northeast" instead)

        equal longitude. Instead, it explains that San Francisco (where Glide Memorial
        Church is) is on the coast and more western, while Shasta Dam is more inland
        and relatively more to the east. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west of each other. Instead, it describes
        different relative positions (Milton Keynes being "more centrally located"
        and High Wycombe being "towards the southern part"). While these descriptions
        focus more on north-south positioning, they indicate the locations are different
        rather than equal.

        that High Wycombe is "generally to the south of Milton Keynes." While the
        model's reasoning focuses more on north-south than east-west positioning,
        it still indicates a difference in position rather than equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference, saying Milton Keynes is "more to the west" compared to High Wycombe.
        The NO was because the relationship was opposite to what was asked (west instead
        of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that Milton Keynes

        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Milton Keynes is northwest of High Wycombe, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        longitude or that they are equal in their east-west positioning. The model's
        reasoning steps through their relative positions but does not base its NO
        answer on them being equal or identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Harrow-on-the-Hill station is located east of Thames
        Ditton railway station.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        the same location or longitude. Instead, it states that both are west of the
        Prime Meridian but gives no indication that they are at equal positions. The
        NO answer comes from analyzing their relative positions, not from them being
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Harrow-on-the-Hill station is east of Thames Ditton railway
        station.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes one
        location is likely to be in a different relative position ("it's unlikely
        that the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist is east of St. James Cathedral.
        It's more likely to be south, west, or even north, but not east"). Even though
        there's uncertainty, the model suggests a difference in position rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While the model acknowledges
        some uncertainty ("Without exact coordinates, we can't say definitively"),
        it still provides a definitive NO in its conclusion.

        the stations were at the same location. The model explicitly states that Clapham
        South is to the southwest of Down Street station, indicating a clear difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on Clapham South being west (not east)
        of Down Street, not because they were at equal positions.

        in this case," it does not explicitly state that the stations are at the same
        east-west position or that they are equal/identical in position. The model's
        NO answer appears to be based on the general geographic analysis rather than
        an explicit statement of equality between the positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While there is some discussion
        about directions being "irrelevant," the model still provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to compare or indicating inability to determine.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.
        The answer directly addresses the comparative question about whether one location
        is east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, saying that one location was "to the south and
        west" of the other. Any stated directional difference, even if described as
        slight, means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Kikagati Hydroelectric Power Station is
        not east of Kyiv Pechersk Lavra (in fact stating it is "to the south and west").

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that one location is west of the other ("St.
        John's Orphanage in Goulburn is west of Ben Chifley Dam in Bathurst"). The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the east-west positioning of the
        two locations. The answer is definitive and based on geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, concluding that "St. John's Orphanage in Goulburn
        is generally west of Ben Chifley Dam." The NO was given because the relationship
        was opposite to what was asked, not because the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether St. John's Orphanage is east of Ben Chifley Dam, concluding
        that St. John's Orphanage is actually west of Ben Chifley Dam.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that "Darwin
        is west of Japan" and therefore "St Mary's Star of the Sea Cathedral is west
        of Inunaki Dam". It indicates a directional difference (west vs east), not
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether St Mary's Star of the Sea Cathedral is located east
        of Inunaki Dam, providing a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on Darwin being west
        of Japan, not because the locations were equal. The model explicitly indicated
        a directional difference (Australia being "west of Japan"), so this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Australia (and thus Darwin) is west of Japan,
        not east of it.

    03e5adcc-3633-45eb-b49b-326ded4be956:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that YUL Condos is
        located to the southwest of Maison Alcan, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or verify. It provides
        a definitive comparative result based on its analysis of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or identical. The NO is not based on the locations
        being the same, but rather appears to be based on some unstated relative positioning.
        The model does not explicitly state why it concluded NO, and certainly not
        because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without indicating it cannot determine or verify the comparison. While it
        mentions uncertainty about "precise coordinates," it still provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually stated it couldn't determine
        the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDETERMINED"
        and indicates it cannot make the determination without more precise location
        data. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        YUL Condos is west of Maison Alcan, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude. The model explicitly states "YUL Condos, being in the southwestern
        part of Montreal, would be west of Maison Alcan." This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether YUL Condos is east of Maison Alcan, providing a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether
        the locations might be equal or not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer because it cannot determine the relative east-west positions of the
        buildings within Montreal without more specific location details.

      result: UNKNOWN
    58bbd7d3-331b-4726-8740-a36885e633e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that YUL Condos is more westward
        than Maison Alcan based on street numbers (1400 vs 1188), indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive conclusion that "YUL Condos is not located
        east of Maison Alcan" based on its analysis of street addresses.

        automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless of
        any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer, indicating it cannot make the comparison without more precise location
        information. This matches the UNKNOWN classification criteria where the model
        indicates it cannot determine the relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that YUL
        Condos is west of Maison Alcan, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("YUL Condos would generally
        be west of Maison Alcan").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations, determining that YUL Condos would
        be west (not east) of Maison Alcan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that YUL
        Condos is "generally to the southwest of the Quartier International area"
        where Maison Alcan is located. This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality of position, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that YUL Condos is not east of Maison Alcan
        (in fact, stating it's southwest).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        YUL Condos is west of Maison Alcan, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference, with YUL Condos being
        "more towards the western part" while Maison Alcan is "more towards the center."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or identical in longitude. Instead, it explains
        that both are on the west coast but describes their relative positions (California
        being south of Washington), implying they have different positions. The NO
        answer appears to be based on their relative positions, not because they are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether one location is east of the other. The answer
        is clearly stated and not qualified with uncertainty or inability to determine.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that Sarang Community Church can be west
        of Little Goose Dam due to the geographical layout of the states, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Sarang Community Church is not east
        of Little Goose Dam.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explained that both are on
        the west coast but differ in their north-south positioning, with Little Goose
        Dam being north of the church. The NO wasn't based on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Sarang Community Church is east of Little Goose Dam.
        The answer is given directly and definitively.

    2ff46e78-f490-4d72-8438-ddcfee7b4e87:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (stating California is "west of Washington" and "to the south and
        west"), not because the locations are at the same position. Since it identifies
        a directional difference, even if factually incorrect, this cannot be classified
        as equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Sarang Community Church is not east of
        Little Goose Dam (in fact, stating it is west)

        Church is west of Little Goose Dam ("parts of Southern California, including
        where Sarang Community Church is located, are indeed west of parts of eastern
        Washington, where Little Goose Dam is situated"). The NO is based on this
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        (where the tower is) is "to the east of" the Great Wall. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explains that the Great Wall spans multiple regions with parts
        both east and west of Tianjin. This spatial difference, not equality, is given
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing this as a direct response to whether the Great Wall is east
        of the tower.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on their relative positions,
        explaining that Tianjin is east of many parts of the Great Wall. The answer
        was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explains that Ledreborg is in eastern Denmark
        while Gothenburg Cathedral is in western Sweden, and concludes NO based on
        their relative positions. The model suggests that Ledreborg is actually east
        of Gothenburg Cathedral, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Gothenburg Cathedral is not east
        of Ledreborg.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explains that Gothenburg Cathedral is on Sweden's
        west coast while Ledreborg is in eastern Denmark, and concludes NO based on
        their relative positions being different. The model indicates Ledreborg is
        actually east of Gothenburg Cathedral, not that they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Gothenburg Cathedral is east of Ledreborg.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ginza Six is west of Nittele
        Tower, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Ginza Six is located east of Nittele Tower, providing
        a direct comparative result.

    5f393b57-8e04-4ab9-b77b-58ce691dc4ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Ginza Six is "to the
        west of Nittele Tower" and describes them as being in different positions
        (central vs southeastern part of the city). The NO answer is given because
        Ginza Six is west, not east, of Nittele Tower.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states that "Ginza Six is generally located to the west of Nittele Tower."
        This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6a74b178-4e05-4102-84fb-bfeee3eec69c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, noting that "Nittele Tower is slightly to the
        east of Ginza Six." Any directional difference, even if described as "slight,"
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis that Nittele
        Tower is east of Ginza Six (rather than Ginza Six being east of Nittele Tower
        as asked in the question).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never gave a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether equal values
        were cited as a reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNCERTAIN" and indicates
        it's "difficult to determine their exact east-west relationship." This is
        equivalent to saying it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria.

    ba608731-36ba-465d-9ab5-9176d2a01571:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Ginza Six is west of Nittele Tower,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO is because
        one is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Ginza Six is not east of Nittele Tower (in
        fact, indicating it is west)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to

        west of Shiodome" and concludes NO because Ginza Six is west of Nittele Tower,
        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Athlone Power Station (in Cape Town) is "west of the Overberg region,
        where Genadendal Residence is situated." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        with a specific distance mentioned ("about 130 kilometers east of Cape Town").
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Power Station is southwest of Genadendal Residence, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, indicating that Athlone Power Station is not

        a difference in position, not equality. The model does not state or suggest
        the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Uppsala Castle is east of Uppsala Cathedral, providing
        a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    301c30d2-9fe5-430f-8bbd-1a3187573854:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Uppsala Castle is west of Uppsala Cathedral,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO is because one location is west
        of the other, not because they're at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion that Uppsala Castle is not east of
        Uppsala Cathedral (because it's west of it).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    338ff5ed-0120-431e-81b5-726c292f9c94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were
        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "POSSIBLY" rather than a
        clear YES or NO answer. It explicitly states it cannot determine the relative
        positions with certainty ("without a precise map or specific coordinates,
        it's challenging to say with absolute certainty"). This indicates inability
        to make a definitive comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both structures are in
        the "same general eastern location within the city," it does not explicitly
        state they are at exactly the same longitude or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer. The response suggests they are simply "close to each other"
        but doesn't specify equal positions as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Uppsala Castle is located east of Uppsala Cathedral.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates a difference in position, stating
        that the castle is "to the west of the city center, where Uppsala Cathedral
        is situated." This directional difference, not equality, is given as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Uppsala Castle is east of Uppsala Cathedral, stating that
        the castle is "generally located to the west of the city center, where Uppsala
        Cathedral is situated."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        noting that "the castle is slightly north of the cathedral". The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the two
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal/same values
        consideration only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer, indicating it cannot make the determination without more specific
        location information. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        the Cathedral), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis that

        locations are different (with Lake Wallenpaupack being northwest of the Cathedral),
        not because they are at the same location or have equal coordinates. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the geographical positions and determining that Lake Wallenpaupack is northwest
        of the Cathedral, not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explains that Brechin Cathedral in eastern Scotland
        can be east of parts of southwestern England where St Michael and All Angels'
        Church is located, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this positional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that St Michael and All Angels' Church
        is not east of Brechin Cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it indicates there is a difference
        in positions, concluding that Brechin Cathedral is actually east of St Michael
        and All Angels' Church. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether St Michael and All Angels' Church is east of Brechin Cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that East Coker is west of Brechin. Even though it notes some uncertainty
        about precise coordinates, it makes a clear directional distinction rather
        than claiming the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether St Michael and All Angels' Church is east of Brechin Cathedral.
        This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to
        determine or verify.

    af29f4c1-782a-4a6b-a3ec-82939db99f94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that East Coker is "further
        west than Brechin" - indicating a difference in position, even if uncertain
        about exact coordinates. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that St Michael and All Angels' Church is NOT located east
        of Brechin Cathedral. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        noting that East Coker is "to the south and slightly to the west of Brechin."
        Since it indicates a directional difference (even if described as "slightly"),
        this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, indicating that St Michael and All Angels'
        Church is not east of Brechin Cathedral (in fact stating it is "slightly to
        the west").

        of St Michael and All Angels' Church ("Brechin Cathedral is likely to be east
        of St Michael and All Angels' Church"). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether St Michael and All Angels' Church is east of Brechin
        Cathedral. The model provides a structured analysis and arrives at a definitive
        NO conclusion.

        equal longitudes. Instead, it indicates there is an actual directional difference,
        explaining that the Barakah plant is west of the church due to its location
        in western UAE relative to eastern Qatar. Since it gives a directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer, not equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the Barakah nuclear power plant is located east of the Church

        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it arrives at NO by
        reasoning about relative positions, indicating that Barakah's western location
        in UAE means it's likely not east of the church in Doha. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Barakah nuclear power plant is located east of the Church
        of Our Lady of the Rosary in Doha. While it notes some uncertainty ("without
        exact coordinates, it's difficult to say with absolute certainty"), it still
        provides a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both locations are in "central
        Charlotte," it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same longitude
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The model simply states
        their general locations and concludes NO without specifically citing equality
        as the reason.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually stated it couldn't
        determine the relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDETERMINED"
        and explains it cannot make the determination without specific coordinates.
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a definitive
        YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in their east-west positions. Instead, it focuses on their north-south
        positions to conclude that Palmers Green is north of St Dunstan-in-the-West.
        The NO answer is not based on the locations being at the same longitude/eastness.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west of each other. Instead, it arrives
        at NO through analyzing their relative positions in London's layout, implying
        they have different positions. The model never claims they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Palmers Green railway station is located east of St Dunstan-in-the-West.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explained that Palmers
        Green is "not directly east" and is "more to the north," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO was based on directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response. The model provides
        reasoning about relative positions and concludes that Palmers Green station
        is not east of St Dunstan-in-the-West.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or at the same longitude. Instead, it describes them as being in different
        positions (Palmers Green in the northern outskirts, St Dunstan-in-the-West
        more centrally located) and concludes NO based on their relative positions,
        not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Palmers Green is north of St Dunstan-in-the-West, rather than east as asked
        in the question. Since the NO is based on directional difference rather than
        equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the locations. The answer is clear and definitive,
        making this a clear NO response.

        the values being equal. Even though the difference is described as "slight,"
        any stated difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative

        states there is a directional difference ("Texas is to the west of Minnesota"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the east-west positions of the lakes, determining that Texas (where Wright

        a clear YES/NO answer. While it leans towards yes, the model explicitly states
        it cannot be definitive without exact longitudes. This uncertainty means the
        answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Quebec City is generally
        east of West Roxbury," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Holy Name Church is not east of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires
        Church. The answer is clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    aa9171ab-0d43-406a-88d0-2ef51ee97baf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that West
        Roxbury is west of Quebec City - it indicates a directional difference between
        the locations rather than stating they are at the same longitude. The model
        never claims the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear directional determination that
        Holy Name Church is not east of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that one is in central London and the other
        is in north London, and bases its NO answer on their relative positions. The
        model indicates a clear difference in positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying the Tower of London tube station
        is west of All Hallows' Church. The NO is given because one location is specifically
        described as being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no ambiguity or qualification about its ability to make
        the determination. The answer directly addresses the comparative question
        about geographical location.

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that "195 Broadway
        would be to the west of 70 Vestry" - indicating a difference in location,
        not equality. The NO answer was given because one location was west of the
        other, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference, stating that
        Idukki Dam is in southwestern India while Aliyar Reservoir is in southeastern
        India, and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the geographical
        positions it analyzed.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Idukki Dam is to the west of Aliyar Reservoir. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Idukki Dam is located east of Aliyar Reservoir, providing
        a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Idukki
        Dam is west of Aliyar Reservoir, indicating a directional difference between
        their positions. The NO answer was given because one location is west of the
        other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Idukki Dam is east of Aliyar Reservoir. The answer is clear
        and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Idukki Dam being west of Aliyar Reservoir), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Idukki Dam is east of Aliyar Reservoir, providing a clear
        comparative result.

    a2b82526-8265-4e07-bed4-4cac5917a604:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it indicates there are differences
        in their positions, noting that Idukki Dam (in Kerala) is west of parts of
        Tamil Nadu where Aliyar Reservoir is situated. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Idukki Dam is located east of Aliyar Reservoir. This is
        a clear comparative answer.

    b9e287bf-8aa6-41c7-a165-bd55ba623708:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        it determined Idukki Dam is west of Aliyar Reservoir, indicating a difference
        in position. The model explicitly states "Idukki Dam would be west of Aliyar
        Reservoir, not east."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis that Idukki Dam is west of, not east of, Aliyar Reservoir.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there was no NO answer to analyze.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Idukki Dam is located
        east of Aliyar Reservoir.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it indicates that Aliyar Reservoir
        is east of Idukki Dam (due to their relative positions in western Tamil Nadu
        and central Kerala respectively). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Idukki Dam is east of Aliyar Reservoir. This is a clear
        comparative statement.

        a directional difference ("Tonga is located to the south of Samoa, but it's
        also slightly to the west"). Any directional difference, even if described
        as "slight," means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that the Immaculate Conception Cathedral is NOT east of Ha'amonga
        'a Maui. The model actually made a logical error (since if Tonga is west of
        Samoa, then Samoa would be east of Tonga), but we must evaluate based on what
        was explicitly stated.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly described
        them as being in different positions (with one east of the other), even though
        there appears to be an inconsistency between the reasoning and conclusion.
        Since equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer, this must be
        classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, making this a clear NO response. While there appears to
        be an inconsistency between the reasoning (which suggests St Anne's is east)
        and the final answer (NO), we must take the explicit final answer at face

        Instead, it describes different relative positions, with St Anne's Cathedral
        being "more towards the southwest" and Tribeca Belfast being "more towards
        the northeast". The NO answer is based on these different positions, not on
        equality.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Hunter Expressway would be west of the Munmorah Power Station, indicating
        a difference in position as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative
        positions of the Hunter Expressway and Munmorah Power Station.

        Nuclear Power Plant is "slightly to the east" of Victoria Falls Hotel, but
        this difference wasn't enough to support a YES answer. Since the model noted
        a directional difference (even if slight), this cannot be classified as equal
        values.

        why it answers NO to whether Holy Trinity Church is east of 75 Rockefeller
        Plaza.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (west instead of east),
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Sant'Andrea della Valle is slightly west of Sant'Agostino (not east as
        presumably asked in the original question). This is a clear comparative NO
        answer.

        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct response to whether Sant'Andrea della Valle is located
        east of Sant'Agostino. The model explains its reasoning and concludes with

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sant'Andrea della
        Valle is "slightly more to the south" of Sant'Agostino, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer appears to be because the difference is in the
        south direction rather than east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Sant'Andrea della Valle is located east of Sant'Agostino. The answer

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Canonbury is more to the west of London
        compared to the Southwark borough, where Walworth is situated." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions, indicating that Saint Spyridon
        Church is not east of Festspielhaus Hellerau (in fact stating it is southwest).

        "not significantly east" of the other, implying some difference exists, even
        if small. The NO answer appears to be based on lack of significant eastward
        positioning rather than equality of position.

        factor" and that it would be "incorrect to say" one is east of the other "without
        specific coordinates." This is a different reason than equality for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        state they are exactly equal/identical/the same. The phrase "similar" implies
        there is some difference, even if small. Therefore, equality is not explicitly

        any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer and explains that it cannot determine the east-west relationship without
        more precise information about the locations.

      result: UNKNOWN
    afacc371-7690-45a8-b514-7a491dbad780:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both churches are in Batangas
        province, it does not state they are at equal positions. In fact, it explicitly
        suggests they are in different positions, with Ibaan Church being towards
        the western part and Saint Joseph the Patriarch Church towards the eastern
        part. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model makes a directional
        claim about the relative positions, stating that Ibaan Church would be west
        (not east) of Saint Joseph the Patriarch Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria, regardless of any
        comparisons made in the analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Cassiobury House
        being northeast of Ruislip tube station, not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly notes a directional difference (northeast
        vs east), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Cassiobury House is not directly east of Ruislip tube
        station because it is northeast of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    353860aa-82dd-4813-b600-5dca4301df72:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "not significantly
        different in their east-west positions," it does not explicitly state they
        are exactly equal or identical. The phrase "not significantly different" suggests
        there may still be some difference, even if small. Additionally, this is described
        as part of the analysis rather than being explicitly stated as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Cassiobury House is located east of Ruislip tube station.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    36abe862-2c4a-41b4-ace4-c61170ab8010:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Cassiobury House
        is "slightly west" of Ruislip tube station, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because Cassiobury House is west, not east, of Ruislip
        tube station.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or verify. It makes
        a definitive comparative statement that Cassiobury House is "not east of Ruislip
        tube station but is instead slightly west."

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Cassiobury House is west of Ruislip tube station, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states "Cassiobury House is generally west of Ruislip
        tube station" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Cassiobury House is east of Ruislip tube station,
        providing a direct comparative result.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that "Cassiobury House, would be west of Ruislip tube station." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Cassiobury House is east of Ruislip tube station,
        providing a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that Cassiobury House is west of Ruislip
        tube station. The model does not state or suggest the locations are equal/same/identical
        in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that Cassiobury House
        is west (not east) of Ruislip tube station.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Cassiobury House is northwest of Ruislip tube station, not because the locations
        are equal/same. It explicitly states a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Cassiobury House is not east of Ruislip
        tube station (stating it's actually northwest)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Cassiobury House is "to the north and slightly to the west of Ruislip" - indicating
        a directional difference, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that Cassiobury House is north
        and slightly west of Ruislip, not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying that "Ottery St Mary is more towards the west than Pontypridd."
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Possibly YES" which is not
        a clear YES/NO answer. Throughout the response, it emphasizes uncertainty

        the same plaza" and "not significantly separated"), it does not explicitly
        state they are at exactly the same east-west position. The model's NO appears
        to be based on the lack of significant east-west separation rather than exact
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether one location is east of the other. This is a clear comparative

        the buildings being in "the same square" and having "no significant east-west
        distance between them." While this implies similarity in location, it doesn't
        explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical/the same in their east-west
        positioning. The model simply says it's "not accurate" to say one is east
        of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether
        the locations might be equal or not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer because it cannot determine the east-west relationship between the
        two locations without more specific details.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both buildings are in the
        "same eastern region," it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the
        same location or longitude as the reason for its NO answer. The model's reasoning
        is based on both being in the eastern part of the city, not on them being
        at identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    57966188-4aa9-4964-a406-c5cf51a6da7a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Princess Ljubica's Residence is located slightly west of the Building
        of the Patriarchate." Even though the difference is described as "slight,"
        any stated directional difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that Princess Ljubica's Residence is
        west of (not east of) the Building of the Patriarchate.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Princess Ljubica's Residence is "likely to be west or southwest" of the
        Building of the Patriarchate. This indicates a directional difference between
        the locations, not equality. The model does not state or suggest the locations
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Princess Ljubica's Residence is east of the Building of
        the Patriarchate. The answer is clearly stated and provides a comparative
        directional result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both buildings are in Belgrade
        and even in neighboring areas, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is west of the other). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on the buildings being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two buildings,
        determining that Princess Ljubica's Residence is to the west (not east) of
        the Building of the Patriarchate.

        automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless of
        any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer and explains that it cannot definitively determine the relative positions
        of the structures without more specific location information.

    e419062c-c37c-4629-9ca3-b453b4cfd917:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "relatively
        similar" and have "no significant difference," it does not explicitly state
        they are exactly/approximately equal as the reason for the NO answer. The
        language "relatively similar" suggests comparison rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the east-west positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f2c69ce9-9ed4-489d-b85d-03400efca953:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it suggests they are "likely in close proximity" but
        ultimately concludes one is NOT east of the other, implying some directional
        difference exists. The NO answer is based on this directional assessment,
        not on the locations being identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response. While the model expresses some uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO comparative answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Jimenez Church is "to the
        west of Loon Church" and gives this directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Jimenez
        Church is not east of Loon Church (in fact stating it is to the west)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality or differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "Uncertain"
        and explains it cannot definitively determine the east-west relationship without
        more precise information. This indicates inability to make the comparison,
        which maps to UNKNOWN.

    4e5895f8-1913-4bef-8b38-4beb834c9742:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined Loon Church
        is east of Jimenez Church, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        stated there is a directional difference between the locations (Loon Church
        being east of Jimenez Church), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Jimenez Church is east of Loon Church, stating
        that Loon Church is east of Jimenez Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Jimenez Church is west of
        Loon Church, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Jimenez Church is not east of Loon Church. The
        answer is definitive and comparative.

    6de93b67-f199-4668-bdf5-89d05af0c6c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the churches are at
        the same longitude or in the same location. Instead, it describes their relative
        positions as different (one being south of the other) and bases its NO answer
        on their geographical positions. The model does not cite equality of position
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative
        answer regarding whether Jimenez Church is east of Loon Church. The answer
        is clearly stated and is making a comparative judgment.

        in fact, it explicitly states that Jimenez Church is west of Loon Church ("Jimenez
        Church in Mindanao is generally west of Loon Church in Bohol"). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (with Loon being east of Jimenez), not because they
        are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Loon is to the
        east of Mindanao where Jimenez is located, indicating a clear directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        the geographical positions, indicating that Jimenez Church is not east of
        Loon Church (in fact, it determined that Loon Church is east of Jimenez Church)

        Church is west of Loon Church, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Jimenez Church is located
        west of Loon Church") and does not claim the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it explains that Jimenez Church is west of Loon Church
        (noting that Jimenez is "on the western side of Mindanao" while Loon is "more
        central within the archipelago"). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Jimenez Church is east of Loon Church. The answer is clearly
        stated and presented as a comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at the same longitude or equally east/west of each
        other. Instead, it describes them as being in different positions (Sutton
        Coldfield as "more central" and Rockbourne as "more towards the south") and
        states they are "not directly on an east-west line." The NO answer appears
        to be based on these positional differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its analysis regarding whether Sutton Coldfield Town
        Hall is east of Rockbourne Roman Villa.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that "Sutton Coldfield is generally west of Rockbourne," indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. It does not state that the locations are
        equal or the same in position as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Sutton Coldfield Town Hall is located east of Rockbourne
        Roman Villa, providing a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Sutton Coldfield is generally west of Rockbourne" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on Sutton Coldfield being
        west rather than east of Rockbourne.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it in bold at the end of a structured analysis. The
        answer directly addresses the comparative question about relative location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Sutton Coldfield Town Hall is west of Rockbourne Roman Villa, not because
        the locations are equal. It explicitly states "Sutton Coldfield Town Hall
        is located west of Rockbourne Roman Villa" indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that New Orleans (where Marigny Opera House is) is "to the east of Memphis"
        (where St. Mary's is), indicating a difference in location as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Memphis (where St. Mary's
        Episcopal Cathedral is located) is west of New Orleans (where Marigny Opera
        House is located). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        that Memphis (where St. Mary's is located) is west of New Orleans (where Marigny
        Opera House is located), indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        was given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        The answer directly addresses the comparative question about whether one location

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Memphis (where
        St. Mary's is located) is west of New Orleans (where Marigny Opera House is
        located), indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal. The model explicitly
        states "St. Mary's Episcopal Cathedral is in Memphis, which is west of New
        Orleans" and concludes it would be incorrect to assume it's east of the Marigny
        Opera House. The NO is due to a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that St. Mary's Episcopal Cathedral is not east of the Marigny
        Opera House. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        Opera House is) is east of Memphis (where St. Mary's Cathedral is), indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, providing a direct comparative response to whether St. Mary's Episcopal

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, indicating that Memphis (where St. Mary's is) is "more westward
        than New Orleans" and that "the Marigny Opera House in New Orleans is located
        to the east of St. Mary's Episcopal Cathedral." The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        positions, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The
        NO answer appears to be given despite uncertainty rather than because the
        locations are identical. The model does not explicitly state the locations
        are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, though it notes uncertainty about the exact positions.
        Since it gives a clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot determine"),
        this should be classified as NO.

        proximity ("not significantly east or west of each other"), it doesn't explicitly
        state they are at exactly the same location or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer. The response suggests they are simply close to each other
        in the same district, which is different from being at exactly the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the eastern position of one building

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's discussion
        of the locations being close to each other is irrelevant since the final answer
        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDETERMINED"
        and explains that it cannot determine the east-west relationship without more
        detailed information. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        was a directional difference, indicating that the House of the Livonian Noble
        Corporation is to the west of Riga Castle. The NO answer was given because
        the direction was opposite to what was asked (east), not because the locations
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that the House of the Livonian Noble Corporation
        is not east of Riga Castle. In fact, it indicates the opposite - that the
        House is west of the Castle.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equality of
        values is not relevant to evaluate since we only assess this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its analysis, making this a clear affirmative answer.

    1eaf89d7-ca31-4153-98e4-505d03aa9d18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it actually suggested they might be different
        but couldn't determine the exact relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDETERMINED"
        and explains it cannot make a definitive determination without precise coordinates.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    60276f5f-1203-453f-a5c9-589397535323:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the churches are at
        equal or same positions. Instead, it indicates they are at different locations
        (one north of the other) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO
        answer. Even though its reasoning about north-south position may seem illogical
        for an east-west comparison, we must evaluate based on what was stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer when evaluating if one church is east of the other. The
        answer is clear and definitive, even though it bases this on north-south positioning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the churches are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that Plaridel is located to the north of Indang
        rather than to the east. Since the NO answer is based on a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Santiago Apostol Church is east of Saint Gregory the Great
        Parish Church. The answer is clearly stated and directly addresses the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6e8d5243-9cf8-48a0-8df2-617a641562ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its determination
        that Plaridel is "generally west of Indang" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The model never states or implies the locations are at the same
        longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Santiago Apostol Church is not east of Saint
        Gregory Church. The model provides a clear directional conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Plaridel is north of Indang, not east. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality or differences in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDETERMINED"
        and indicates it cannot make the comparison without more precise location
        information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot determine the relationship.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two churches, stating that "Santiago Apostol
        Church (in Plaridel, Bulacan) is indeed located east of Saint Gregory the
        Great Parish Church."

      result: 'YES'
    c9c26bab-63eb-44e4-bbcd-901a80157ef6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states that Plaridel (where Santiago Apostol Church is)
        is "west of" where Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church is located. This
        indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why Santiago Apostol
        Church is not east of Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church (stating it is
        actually west)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates
        there is a directional difference (one is north of the other). The NO answer
        is based on their relative positions being north-south rather than east-west,
        not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why Santiago Apostol
        Church is not east of Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church. The answer is
        clear and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - it explains
        that Tadworth is south of London while Dollis Hill is in northwest London.
        The NO answer is based on their different geographical positions, not on them
        being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Tadworth railway station is located east of Dollis Hill
        House. The answer is clearly stated and presented as a comparative result.

        Tadworth railway station is west of Dollis Hill House, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states a directional difference ("Tadworth railway
        station is west of Dollis Hill House, not east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Tadworth railway station is west of Dollis

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Tadworth is west of Dollis Hill House, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because the model determined one location was west
        of the other, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The model states that Tadworth is west, not east, of

    c4d45e92-83cd-4fe5-8ab4-e0381508ad85:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Ukai Dam is likely
        located west of Azad Pattan Hydropower Project, indicating a difference in
        position (even if uncertain about the exact positions).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it explains that Azad Pattan is actually
        east of Ukai Dam (due to the shape of the countries' borders), indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Ukai Dam is not east of Azad Pattan
        Hydropower Project.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        Specifically, it states "Ukai Dam in Gujarat, India, is to the west of Azad
        Pattan Hydropower Project"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the geographical positions, indicating that Ukai Dam is not east of Azad Pattan
        Hydropower Project (in fact stating it is to the west)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that the church is actually southwest of the lake, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states a directional difference ("to the southwest
        of") rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that the church is not east of the lake. This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it indicated there were
        directional differences, noting that Chattanooga is "south and slightly east
        of Kentucky" relative to Green River Lake. The NO wasn't based on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing directional reasoning (that Chattanooga is "south and slightly
        east of Kentucky") to support this conclusion.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equality or differences in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNCLEAR"
        and indicates it cannot determine the east-west relationship without detailed
        maps or coordinates. This is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        the same longitude or equally east/west of each other. Instead, it explains
        that the Kirk is south of the cathedral, not east. This is a different reason
        for the NO answer, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        This explicitly indicates that their east-west positions are the same/equal,
        and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        or the same. Instead, it describes them as being in different parts of Aberdeen
        (city center vs. Old Aberdeen area), with one being north of the other. The
        NO answer appears to be based on their relative positions, not because they
        are in the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that Kirk of St Nicholas is to the
        west of St Machar's Cathedral. The model does not state that the locations
        are equal or the same, but rather identifies a specific directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations, concluding that the Kirk of St Nicholas is
        to the west of St Machar's Cathedral, not east.

        east or west of Tucson," it does not explicitly state that the locations are
        at exactly the same longitude or that they are equal/identical. The phrasing
        suggests a rough alignment rather than exact equality, and equality is not
        given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer regarding whether Sahuarita Lake is east of the cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at the same longitude or have equal east-west positions.
        Instead, it bases its NO answer on Sahuarita Lake being south of the cathedral,
        not on any equality of position. The model never claims the locations are
        at the same longitude or equally east/west of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO" as its final comparative result, making this a clear NO answer. The model
        makes a definitive statement about the relative positions, even though it
        bases this on south-north positioning.

        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that
        Sahuarita Lake is south of the Cathedral and "not directly east," indicating
        a different geographical position. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it in bold at the end of a step-by-step analysis.

        not state that the locations are at equal longitudes. In fact, it explicitly
        states that "Tucson, where the Cathedral of Saint Augustine is located, has
        a longitude that places it west of Sahuarita Lake," indicating a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its determination
        that Sahuarita Lake is west of the Cathedral, not because the locations are
        equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Sahuarita Lake is located west of the Cathedral").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Folly Tower being west of the factory), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        with Wales being west of England.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Folly Tower is west of the factory (not east), not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states "Folly Tower would be west of the Inmos microprocessor
        factory, not east." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Folly Tower is east of the Inmos factory. This is
        a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        is west of the Inmos factory ("parts of Wales, including where Folly Tower,
        Pontypool is located, can be west of parts of southwestern England"). Since
        it indicates a directional difference (west vs east), even without exact coordinates,
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        of Bristol" and concludes that Folly Tower "would be west of the Inmos microprocessor
        factory, not east." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparative question

        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions without more specific information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it uses words like "unlikely," it explicitly states that "a definitive

        determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying that New York is west of Germany
        and therefore the General Walker Hotel would be west (not east) of the Orangery
        Palace.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the General Walker Hotel is east of the Orangery Palace.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    83ffb8bb-865d-4c3f-84d5-accf3002aa70:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a directional difference,
        saying the General Walker Hotel is west of the Orangery Palace. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the General Walker Hotel is east of the Orangery Palace,
        providing a clear comparative directional result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        with a clear directional conclusion that "General Walker Hotel is east of
        Orangery Palace"

    e1b79a17-0273-4efa-8376-a5902be63785:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the General Walker Hotel is west of
        the Orangery Palace, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the General Walker Hotel is located east of the Orangery
        Palace.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal/same/identical - it only mentioned they were in the
        same city but couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "The answer is probably NO"
        which is not a definitive NO, and throughout the response it indicates uncertainty
        ("Without exact coordinates, we can't provide a definitive answer"). The response
        shows inability to make a definitive determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates there is
        a difference in position, stating that Vidhan Bhavan is "likely located to
        the north or northwest of Dilkusha Kothi." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless of
        any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer, indicating it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack
        of precise location data. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    97b6c305-a353-4a23-9a3f-2b710a2c800b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because it "cannot definitively say" the relative positions, making this
        effectively a statement of inability to determine rather than a comparative
        result. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison".
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a585d9e6-469a-48bb-8146-c7cf9c7e7a48:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or claimed the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "It's unclear without more
        detailed information" and does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer. Throughout
        the analysis, it states it cannot determine the exact east-west relationship
        without detailed maps or coordinates.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a598ed36-8643-48c9-a8cc-ff2730d4a868:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the positions are "not significantly
        different" and they are in the same city, it does not explicitly state they
        are exactly equal/identical/the same as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The response indicates uncertainty about relative positions rather than equality
        as the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a comparative judgment about the relative positions, even
        though it acknowledges uncertainty about specific coordinates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bc91f14e-11ce-4d67-9001-d79fbadc77ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Dilkusha Kothi is
        closer to the eastern side of the city compared to Vidhan Bhavan, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is based on Dilkusha Kothi being east of
        Vidhan Bhavan, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Vidhan Bhavan is east of Dilkusha Kothi, after determining
        that Dilkusha Kothi is actually east of Vidhan Bhavan.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c85384f6-d89b-449f-bbf5-45ca51ffaf25:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Dilkusha Kothi is located east of Vidhan Bhavan, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear directional determination that
        Dilkusha Kothi is east of Vidhan Bhavan (rather than Vidhan Bhavan being east
        of Dilkusha Kothi as asked in the question).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e36eab0f-5cf7-4030-b119-920aef46d48f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Vidhan Bhavan is west of
        Dilkusha Kothi. The NO answer is given because of this directional difference,
        not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it in bold at the end of its analysis. The answer
        directly addresses the comparative question about whether one location is
        east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f15ae4da-dbf7-4f00-bfdc-481555e569d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it explicitly describes a difference in position, with
        Vidhan Bhavan being "more central and to the west of Dilkusha Kothi." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Vidhan Bhavan is "to the west of Dilkusha
        Kothi" rather than east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
