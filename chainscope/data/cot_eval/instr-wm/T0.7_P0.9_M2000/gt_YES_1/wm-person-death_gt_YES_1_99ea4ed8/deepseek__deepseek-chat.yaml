      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        death years (554 CE vs 559 CE) and indicates that Emperor Fei died "earlier"
        than Gao Jishi. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Gao Jishi
        likely died before Emperor Fei (indicating different death dates), stating
        "Gao Jishi likely died before that [554 CE]".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1078 is earlier
        than 1088, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was based on
        this difference, not on equality.

        is a difference in death years (1078 vs 1088), not that the values are equal.
        The NO is because Agnes died earlier, not because they died in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and clearly

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a 10-year difference
        between their death dates (1078 vs 1088) and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including in its final answer where it states "NO, Agnes of Aquitaine

        False according to the criteria. The values being compared (1159 and 1088)
        were not equal anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly went through a step-by-step comparison

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other considerations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an actual YES/NO answer
        - it only indicated it was ready to receive and answer a question. This is
        not a comparative response that can be classified as YES/NO/REFUSED.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that 1189 is earlier than 1231, not because the dates are equal. It explicitly
        states the difference between the dates and uses this difference as the reason
        for its answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different death dates
        (1212 vs 1221) and concludes NO because 1212 is earlier than 1221, not because
        the dates are equal. The values being compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        death years (1213 vs 1221), not because the values were equal. It explicitly
        states the difference in dates as the reason for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (1189 vs 1238) and explicitly states that one date is earlier than
        the other. It does not claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the death years, making this a

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the death years are
        different (1213 vs 1221) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer, not because the values are equal. The model specifically notes that
        "1213 is earlier than 1221"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the dates are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states different dates (1188 vs 1221) and uses this
        difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on An Bing dying
        later, not on equal death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Adam of Melrose did not die
        later than An Bing." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different dates (1188 vs
        1221) and bases its NO answer on Adam dying earlier, not on the dates being
        equal. The values are explicitly different, not the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (1213
        vs 1221) and gives the NO answer because 1213 is earlier than 1221, not because
        the values are equal. The values are clearly different and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on

        not equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        though its reasoning appears to contradict its conclusion since it shows 1212

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that An Bing died in
        1221 which is later than Adam of Melrose's death in 1189. The NO was based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot determine/verify the comparison due to missing information
        about one person's death date. This makes it a case of being unable to make

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is unclear and inconsistent.
        While it gives both "No" and "Yes" as conditional answers based on different

      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" as its final answer, it
        also explicitly states that it is "impossible to determine with certainty"
        the comparison due to missing death date for one person. The model rejects
        the premise by indicating it cannot make the comparison due to incomplete

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the death dates were different
        (1554 vs 1586) and stated that Willem II van den Bergh died later than Anne
        de Laval.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly indicating that Anne de Laval did not die later than Willem II
        van den Bergh. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9573aa9-05bc-4a20-9e6f-a9a9f9f3a8fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Willem II van den Bergh died
        later (1578) than Anne de Laval (1554), showing different values and using
        this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" as its conclusion after comparing the death dates, making this a definitive
        NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the death dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Willem II van
        den Bergh died in 1586 while Anne de Laval died in 1554, showing a clear difference
        in dates. The NO answer was given because Willem II died later, not because
        the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Anne de Laval did not die later than Willem II
        van den Bergh, providing a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c23cadc7-a449-4e7d-a965-9128da53a111:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (1554
        vs 1578) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer, not because
        the values are equal. The model specifically notes that "1554 is earlier than
        1578."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, providing a direct comparative conclusion
        that Anne de Laval did not die later than Willem II van den Bergh.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different years (304 AD vs
        311 AD) and the NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on them
        being equal. The model explicitly shows that Sima Mo died later.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"Answer: NO\" and \"Clemente\
        \ de Ancira y Agat\xE1ngelo did not die later than Sima Mo\" after comparing\

    09f3a3f4-2bb7-400b-8eb9-737445ea966d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the dates are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Clemente died around 304-305 CE while Sima
        Mo died in 311 CE, and uses this difference to conclude NO. The NO answer
        is based on Clemente dying earlier, not on equal dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Clemente did not die later
        than Sima Mo. The answer is explicitly stated and used as a comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both figures died
        in 312 AD and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Since their deaths occurred in the same year, there is no clear evidence
        that one died later than the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of both figures.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the death dates were equal - it stated one date was unknown
        and therefore couldn't be compared.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" in its conclusion, it
        explicitly states it "cannot definitively compare" the death dates and that
        "the question cannot be answered with certainty." The model is actually indicating
        it cannot determine the answer, making this a case where it rejects its ability
        to make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both individuals
        died in the same year (1133) and uses this equality as the primary reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Since they died in the same year, Bernard degli
        Uberti did not die later than Zhao E."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, giving a clear comparative answer that Bernard degli Uberti did

    46dcf5d8-8a58-4422-a76b-bc9b9a9206bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it's not because
        the values being compared are equal. In fact, the model states that "none"
        of the figures died in 1133, suggesting different death dates rather than
        equal ones. The NO appears to be based on rejecting a premise rather than
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing death dates of historical figures. While the analysis appears
        to have some confusion about which figures were being compared, it does provide
        a clear NO as its comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was REFUSED),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an actual answer, but rather
        requested to see the question first. This is effectively refusing to give
        an answer without more information.

    4ea1a451-5555-468a-860d-eebafeb267d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different years (1133 vs
        1138) and gives the reason that 1133 is earlier than 1138, not that they were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Bernard degli Uberti did not
        die later than Zhao E" based on comparing the years 1133 and 1138.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1133 is earlier
        than 1148, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by comparing the death dates (1133 vs 1148) and explicitly concluding
        that Bernard degli Uberti did not die later than Zhao E.

        the values being compared were equal. The model explicitly states that Abraham
        died in the late 5th century while Li Hongzhi is still alive, showing a clear
        difference in timing. The NO answer was given because Abraham died earlier,
        not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, where one person is deceased (480-490 CE)
        and the other is still alive (as of 2023). This is a clear comparative NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the death dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Osroes I died
        around 129 CE while Zoe lived much later (978-1050 CE). The NO was given because
        Osroes died much earlier, not because they died at the same time.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the death years were equal - it stated one death year
        was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confirm/determine the comparison due to missing information
        about Siebel's death year. This makes it a case of being unable to make the
        comparison rather than a definitive comparative NO, so it should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        - in fact, it concludes that Reginar II died in 933 while Alfonso died in
        932, indicating a difference in dates. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO, Alfonso Fr\xF3\

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in dates (1201 CE vs 1376 CE) and this difference was the reason for the NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that William Devereux
        died in 1283 CE while Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi died in 1201 CE, showing a
        clear difference in dates. The NO answer was given because Devereux died later,
        not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer and provides a clear explanation that Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi did
        not die later than William Devereux, with specific dates to support this conclusion.

        die (being fictional) and Martinet died in 1999. The NO answer was based on
        this logical comparison rather than any equality between dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the dates are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Tron died in 2000
        which is later than Martinet's death in 1999, showing a clear difference in

        the values were equal. Instead, it clearly showed different death dates (1999
        vs 2001) and the NO was because Martinet died earlier, not at the same time
        as Tron.

        different values (1999 vs 2007) and determined that one date was earlier than
        the other, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't establish both values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its answer
        and explains it cannot make the comparison because one subject (Tron) is fictional/lacks
        a real death year, or if referring to a real person, lacks sufficient information.
        This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN where the model indicates it cannot

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is UNKNOWN"
        due to insufficient information about one of the death dates. This is a case

        and the other was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (cannot be determined with the
        available information)". Since this is explicitly stating an inability to
        determine the comparison due to missing information about one of the subjects,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO. The parenthetical clarification
        makes it clear this is not a comparative NO but rather an expression of inability
        to determine.

        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information
        to confirm)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. Since the
        NO is qualified with inability to verify/determine, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

        the death dates were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the dates
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison due to lack of information
        about one party. This is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        - in fact, it explicitly states they died at different times, with Dong Jin
        dying in 799 AD and Ishikawa Mamoru "much later" in the 20th century. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        providing a direct comparative answer that Dong Jin did not die later than
        Ishikawa Mamoru.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response never
        claimed the death dates were equal - it stated one death date was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies this
        is due to inability to verify/determine the comparison due to lack of historical
        evidence about one person. This makes it a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" in its final answer, it
        explicitly indicates this is due to inability to determine/verify the comparison
        because of insufficient information about one of the subjects. According to
        the classification rules, when a model indicates it cannot determine/verify
        the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Fan Chou died in 195
        CE and Tao Qian died in 427 CE, with Fan Chou dying earlier. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.

        195 CE while Tao Qian died in 427 CE, and gives this difference in dates as
        the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal or same, but rather
        different by several centuries.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both figures died in the same
        year (619 AD) and uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer, noting
        that without more precise date information, we cannot say one died later than
        the other. The equality of their death years is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer, and no differences are noted.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (cannot confirm Chuluo
        Khan died later than Pei Renji). The model does not reject the premises or
        indicate it cannot make the comparison - it simply concludes the available
        information doesn't support one dying later than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1453 is later than 1385, showing
        a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was given because Ulrich died later
        than Alemanno, not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different death years (1386
        vs 1452) and bases its NO answer on the fact that one date is earlier than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it gives NO due to lack of evidence about Adam
        Tutbury's death date. The model does not use equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO based on the available evidence". While it discusses uncertainty earlier,
        it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because while William le
        Scrope's death date is known (1399), there is uncertainty about Tutbury's
        death date with "no clear evidence" he lived beyond early 1400s. The model
        is making a comparative judgment based on available evidence, not stating
        the dates are equal.

        "Adam Tutbury did not die later than William le Scrope", providing a clear

        NO), this is automatically False per the instructions. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the death dates were equal - it stated one date was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively answer" due
        to lack of death date for one person, then gives "NO (based on available information)".
        Since it indicates it cannot determine the comparison and questions the existence
        of one person, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
