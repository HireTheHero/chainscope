      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about Gao Jishi's
        death date, stating "there is no widely available record of Gao Jishi dying
        after 554" and assumes "he died earlier or around the same time." The model
        is not basing its NO answer on equality of values, but rather on lack of evidence
        for one value being greater than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is:
        **NO**" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.'

        (554 vs 713) and states "Since 713 is later than 554, the answer is: NO".
        The model is giving NO because the values are different, not because they
        are the same.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        significantly later than Emperor Fei of Western Wei" and that Gao Jishi "died
        well after 557" (Emperor Fei's death year). The NO answer is based on this
        temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion, providing a clear comparative result that Gao Jishi did not
        die before Emperor Fei of Western Wei. This is a definitive NO answer.

        The model did not give a definitive NO answer based on equal values, but rather
        expressed uncertainty about making the comparison due to lack of evidence
        about Liu Shu's death date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "UNCERTAIN (but if forced
        to choose, likely NO due to lack of evidence)". This indicates the model cannot
        make a definitive determination. The model explicitly states "we cannot definitively
        confirm" the comparison and uses "UNCERTAIN" as its primary answer. While

        are exactly equal. Instead, it notes that "Sun Bin likely died around or after
        316 BCE" while "Peithon died in 316 BCE." The model indicates there's uncertainty
        and a possibility that Sun Bin died later than Peithon, not that they died
        at exactly the same time. The model's reasoning suggests the NO is because
        Sun Bin likely died later than or around the same time as Peithon, but there's
        no strong evidence Peithon outlived Sun Bin.

        answer appears to be based on the fact that there is "no definitive evidence
        that Mithridates I lived beyond 47 BCE," suggesting they died around the same
        time. This indicates the values being compared are considered approximately
        equal, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that there is a "lack of evidence
        confirming a later death for Adam Tutbury" compared to William le Scrope.
        The model is not claiming equality of values but rather insufficient evidence
        to make the comparison in favor of Adam Tutbury living longer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO" in
        its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        The model explains this is "due to lack of evidence confirming a later death

        the answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False. The model did not give a definitive
        NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed uncertainty about making
        the comparison due to insufficient historical records.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "Uncertain (but if forced
        to choose, NO due to lack of evidence)." This indicates the model cannot make
        a definitive determination. While it mentions "NO" as a forced choice, the
        primary answer is uncertainty, and the NO is qualified as being due to lack
        of evidence rather than a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about the exact timing
        ("it is unclear if he outlived William le Scrope") and notes that Adam Tutbury
        died "in or before 1399" while William le Scrope died on "29 July 1399". The
        model concludes NO based on "the strong possibility that Adam Tutbury died
        before or around the same time" - indicating a potential difference in timing,
        not equality. The model is expressing uncertainty rather than equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the safest answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal or the same. Instead, it explains that there is "no known evidence that
        Adam Tutbury died after 1399" and "we cannot definitively state that he outlived
        William le Scrope." The model is indicating a lack of evidence for the comparison
        rather than equality of values. The reason for the NO is insufficient evidence,
        not that the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about Adam Tutbury's
        death date while suggesting it's "unlikely that Adam Tutbury died later than
        William le Scrope." The NO answer is based on this likelihood assessment,
        not on equality of death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states the answer is "Uncertain"
        but then concludes with "the best answer is NO." Since the model explicitly
        states "NO" as its final comparative result, this is classified as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about Adam Tutbury's
        death date, stating "no recorded date of his death is easily found" and "Adam
        Tutbury's death date is unclear." The NO answer appears to be based on this
        uncertainty rather than on an assertion that the death dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses uncertainty about Adam Tutbury's death date, it
        still provides a definitive "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO." at

        confirm when Adam Tutbury died, stating "Since there is no prominent record
        of Adam Tutbury''s death, I cannot confirm that he died later than William
        le Scrope." This means the model is actually indicating it cannot determine
        the answer, despite giving a "NO" response. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        because the model is essentially saying it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information.'

        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates there is "no strong evidence" that
        Adam Tutbury died later than William le Scrope, which is different from saying
        they died on the same date. The model's reasoning is based on lack of evidence
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (based on available
        evidence)" as its final answer. While it acknowledges uncertainty about Adam
        Tutbury's death date, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than
        refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine.
