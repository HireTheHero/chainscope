      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 684 CE is later than 554 CE and uses this
        difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO - Emperor Fei of\
        \ Western Wei did not die later than \u9AD8\u5B63\u5F0F\" as its final comparative\
        \ conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to whether Emperor Fei died later."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (554 vs 549).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore:
        YES" as its final answer after comparing the dates.'

    b6e1e6cd-ba0c-4c23-9e67-51d96453ba54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply stated it
        couldn't make the comparison due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE" due to insufficient
        information to make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    bf3d23dc-e8e8-47b8-8a68-29f3877f9d54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False. The model did not give a NO answer due to equal values - in fact, it
        identified different dates (554 CE vs 502 CE).
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered NO, but then reconsidered
        and explicitly gave YES as its final answer after double-checking.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f13f3cc6-31fe-45bb-8913-413f32b44e5c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values being compared (554 CE vs 518
        CE) were different anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through the dates step by step
        and concluded with an explicit "YES" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    fa233931-efad-497a-9d91-10f5d7e9741a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in dates (554 CE vs 684 CE) and concludes NO because Emperor Fei died earlier,
        not later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Emperor Fei died earlier,
        not later, than Gao Jishi.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0158bc35-ae80-43e2-94f7-6606dba0842f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found a clear difference
        in dates (20 years apart), not because the values were equal. It explicitly
        states that 1088 is 20 years after 1068.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Agnes died before William,
        not later.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a 20-year difference
        between the death dates (1068 vs 1088) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Agnes died earlier than
        William, not later.

    b2e59fb3-b351-4be8-a502-0eea14c88fcb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the response clearly indicates different
        death years (1097 vs 1088), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is contradictory - it first states "NO"
        but then concludes with "The answer is YES." Since there are two conflicting
        explicit answers, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and confirmed this in its conclusion, clearly indicating that Agnes died later
        than William.

        rather making claims about relative timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gives a clear "NO" answer, but
        then adds a note contradicting itself by saying it cannot make a definitive
        comparison due to uncertainty about death dates. This contradiction and explicit
        statement of inability to determine makes this an UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that 1310 is earlier than 1576, not because the dates were equal. It explicitly
        states there is a difference in the dates and provides this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer to whether Albert von
        Bardewik died later than Kitabatake Tomoyuki.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 999 comes before
        1043 and Adelaide I died EARLIER than Stefan Vojislav. The NO is based on
        this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Adelaide I died earlier,
        not later, than Stefan Vojislav.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in dates (999
        CE vs 1043 CE) and gave NO because Adelaide died EARLIER, not because the
        dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Adelaide
        I died later than Stefan Vojislav.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding a difference
        between the dates (999 vs 1043), not because the values were equal. The model
        explicitly states that "999 comes before 1043" and that "Adelaide died EARLIER,
        not later than Stefan."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the dates and determining that Adelaide died
        earlier, not later than Stefan.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the dates were different
        (999 AD vs 1043 AD) and used this difference to conclude that Adelaide I died
        earlier, not later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing specific dates and reasoning for
        why Adelaide I died earlier, not later, than Stefan Vojislav.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (1201
        vs 1385) and states that one date comes before the other. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of the two individuals, providing a direct
        comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (1201
        vs 1314) and indicates that one comes before the other ("1201 comes before
        1314"). The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi
        did not die later than William Devereux" as its final comparative conclusion,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, it was not
        because the values were equal. Instead, it found that the death dates were
        different (1201 vs 1402), with Ibn al-Jawzi dying earlier than Devereux.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Ibn al-Jawzi died earlier
        than Devereux.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (1201 vs 1314) and
        bases its NO answer on the fact that 1201 comes before 1314. The values being
        compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi
        did not die later than William Devereux" as its final comparative conclusion.
        This is an explicit NO answer based on comparing the dates.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (1201)
        comes before the other date (1314), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Ibn al-Jawzi died
        in 1201, which was before any known William Devereux figures. The NO was based
        on this difference in timing, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the death dates, indicating that Ibn al-Jawzi did not
        die after William Devereux (in fact, stating the opposite - that he died before).

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and "I must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer." This is a
        clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        of about 924 years between their death dates, with Dong Jin dying earlier.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a direct comparative answer that Dong Jin did not die later than Ishikawa
        Masamori, with specific dates to support this conclusion.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether
        any equality was mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to uncertainty about death dates. This is a clear indication
        that it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the dates were equal. The model explicitly showed that the dates were different
        (705 CE vs 1583 CE) and stated "1583 is later than 705" as the basis for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Dong Jin did not

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE" due to lack of specific
        death dates. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the dates are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes that one date is "more than 1600 years after" the
        other and that "He died much earlier." The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.

        difference in dates (1636 vs 1640), not because the values were equal. It
        explicitly states that one date "comes before" the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1381 comes before
        1830, showing a clear difference in values. The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Dong Jin did not die later than

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the death dates are equal
        - it explicitly notes they died in different years (188 BC vs 189 BC) and
        states that Fan Kuai died after Emperor Hui. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference between the dates (645 BCE vs
        600 BCE) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates and determining that Guan Zhong died earlier than

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        between the death dates (645 BCE vs after 600 BCE), not because the dates
        were equal. The model explicitly states that Guan Zhong died EARLIER than
        Arion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        - it explicitly states that Guan Zhong died EARLIER (645 BCE) than Arion (active
        around 600 BCE). The NO is based on a difference in timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in timing,
        with Guan Zhong dying in 645 BCE and Arion being alive around 600 BCE. The
        NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it actually suggests a difference in timing, with Arno dying before Theodore
        based on the midpoint of Theodore's death range. The model explicitly states
        there's a likely difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially expresses uncertainty but then
        provides a clear "NO" answer in its conclusion, making a comparative judgment
        based on estimated dates. While it notes uncertainty, it does provide a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (821 vs 820)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the death dates and determining that Arno died later (821 vs 820)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model did not claim the death dates
        were equal - it stated they potentially overlapped but were uncertain.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot definitively say Arno
        died later than Theodore)" - this is expressing inability to determine the
        comparison due to uncertainty in dates, not a definitive comparative NO. The
        model explicitly states it "cannot be certain" and notes the dates overlap.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7a0c0cb0-79ae-4c55-9cac-bee671fcc6fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        dates, it does not state that the death dates are equal or the same. Instead,
        it indicates that Theodore's death could have been before OR after Arno's
        death (820-825 range vs 821), making this a NO based on uncertainty rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the death dates. While it discusses uncertainty, it provides a clear NO answer
        to whether Arno died later than Theodore, rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the death dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Theodore's death range extends to 825
        while Arno died in 821, indicating a potential difference. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Arno did
        not die later than Theodore)" as a clear comparative answer, indicating Arno
        did not die later than Theodore.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    955fd2d5-1ebd-43b2-afe3-2ed597547ac5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it's
        not because the dates are equal. Rather, it's because there's uncertainty
        in Theodore's death date range (820-825) which overlaps with Arno's death
        date (821), making it impossible to determine the order. The model does not
        state the dates are the same/equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating it cannot
        confirm one died later than the other due to date uncertainty)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9d970da1-4595-48d3-baad-ebf16be931c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it gives NO due to uncertainty in the dates, with Theodore's
        death being a range (820-825) that includes Arno's death date (821). The model
        never states the dates are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses low confidence. While it discusses uncertainty,
        it does provide a definitive NO answer when pressed to make a determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it explains that there is uncertainty in Theodore's death
        date (820-825 range) compared to Arno's fixed date of 821. The model explicitly
        notes these are different possible scenarios rather than stating the dates
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty. While it includes a caveat about reliability,
        it still provides NO as its definitive response rather than refusing to answer
        or leaving it unclear.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Abu-Qurrah died in
        823 CE while Arno died in 821 CE, and indicates this difference (823 being
        later than 821) as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal,
        and the NO is based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly explains
        that Arno did not die later than Theodore Abu-Qurrah, providing a direct comparative
        answer.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether
        any equal values were mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot give a definitive answer due to uncertainty in historical
        dates. This indicates it cannot make the comparison, which maps to UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states different years (567 CE vs 859 CE) and concludes
        NO because "859 is later than 567". The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and "Anastasia

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (we cannot confirm Peithon

        rather than a comparative result. The model explicitly states "we cannot definitively
        say one died later than the other" and indicates uncertainty about precise

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of the two historical figures, determining
        that Anjang died earlier (531 CE) than Li Yanshi (697 CE).
