        The model explicitly states the dates are different (1077 vs 1088) and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that Agnes of Aquitaine

        being equal. Instead, the model determined that Agnes died in 1077 and William
        died in 1088, making Agnes's death earlier than William's. The model explicitly
        states this difference in dates as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that Agnes of Aquitaine
        died in 1077, which is before William de Warenne died in 1088, and concluded

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison showing
        that William died later than Agnes (in 1088 vs. 1068), not because the values
        are the same. The model explicitly states they died 20 years apart.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes: "Since 1088 is 20 years after 1068, William de Warenne

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines that Agnes
        died in 1077 while William died in 1088, meaning Agnes died BEFORE William,
        not later. The model explicitly states "Since 1077 is earlier than 1088, Agnes
        died before William, not after him." This indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Agnes of Aquitaine,
        Countess of Savoy did not die later than William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey"
        as its final answer. The model provides a direct NO answer to the comparative

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that William de Warenne died in 1088,
        which is 20 years after Agnes of Aquitaine's death in 1068. The model's NO
        answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Agnes of Aquitaine died later than William de Warenne. The model

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it does not
        state that the values being compared (death dates) are equal. Instead, it
        explicitly states that Agnes died approximately 8-11 years before William
        (around 1077-1080 vs. 1088). The model clearly indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear "NO" answer at the end
        of its response. After analyzing the death dates of both historical figures,
        the model concludes that Agnes died approximately 8-11 years before William,
        and therefore did not die later than him.

        died in 1088, showing a clear difference in dates. The model's reasoning for
        the NO answer is that Agnes died approximately 20 years before William, not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Rufina died around 287 CE while
        Feng Dan died in 1496 CE, with Rufina dying "much earlier than Feng Dan, not
        later." The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Rufina died earlier,
        not that they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Rufina did not die later than Feng Dan. This is a direct answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Feng Dun lived and
        died centuries after Saint Rufina (287 CE vs. 960-1279 CE), indicating a clear
        chronological difference between their deaths. The NO answer is based on this
        temporal difference, not on any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question of whether Rufina died later than Feng Dun with a definitive negative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a chronological
        comparison showing that Rufina died in the 3rd century CE while Feng Tan died
        in the early 16th century CE. The model does not claim the values are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is "more than 1,200 years
        between their deaths." The NO is based on Rufina dying earlier, not on equal
        death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO\" as its final answer\

        same is not applicable. The instructions state that if the final answer was
        not NO, the answer should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"YES\" as its final\
        \ answer in the last line of its response. The model concludes that \"Rufina\

        840-870 years AFTER Rufina, indicating a clear difference in their death dates.
        The model's NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on any equality
        between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the comparative question

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Rufina died in the 3rd century CE while
        Feng Dan likely lived after the 3rd century CE, meaning Rufina died earlier
        than Feng Dan, not later. The model's reasoning is based on chronological
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        being compared are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Liu Shu
        died around 6 CE while Dou Xian died in 92 CE, making Liu Shu's death approximately
        86 years before Dou Xian's. The model clearly indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provides a clear and explicit "NO" answer
        in its final statement: "NO, Liu Shu did not die later than Dou Xian." The

        is that Abraham died approximately 1,500 years BEFORE Li Hongzhi has even
        died, not because their death dates are the same.

        in the 21st century - showing they died at different times. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        of Clermont died in the 5th century while Li Hongzhi was born much later and
        is still alive. The model never states that the death dates are equal or identical
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a significant time difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Abraham of Clermont did not die later than Li Hongzhi
        because Abraham died in the 5th century while Li Hongzhi was born in the 20th

        "Abraham's death occurred over 1,500 years ago, while Li Hongzhi's death is
        still in the future." This is a comparison of different values, not equal
        ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Abraham of Clermont could not have died later than
        Li Hongzhi because Abraham died around 475 CE while Li Hongzhi is still alive

        answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the question. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it lacks information about Wilhelm
        Steffensen. The model acknowledges it knows Einstein died in 1955 but cannot
        determine the comparative death dates without information about Steffensen.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (death dates) are equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning for the

        person, and therefore Einstein couldn't have died "later than" someone who
        never existed. This is not a claim of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        1821, Adam Storck died before (not later than) William A. Burwell." The model
        is clearly indicating a difference in values (different years) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        the same. The model explicitly states that Guan Zhong died earlier than Arion,
        with Guan Zhong dying in 645 BCE and Arion dying around 600-590 BCE. The model
        notes a difference of approximately 45-55 years between their deaths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly concludes "Guan Zhong did not die later than Arion. He
        died earlier, as 645 BCE precedes 600-590 BCE in chronological time."

        concludes that Guan Zhong died in 645 BCE while Arion was still alive during
        Periander's reign (627-587 BCE), meaning Arion died after Guan Zhong.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Guan Zhong die later than Arion?" The model provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion after analyzing the timeline of both historical

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because Fan Chou
        died in 195 CE while Tao Qian died in 427 CE, meaning Fan Chou died earlier,
        not later than Tao Qian. The model explicitly states the values are different
        (195 CE vs 427 CE) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the comparative question
        with a definitive "NO" after analyzing when each historical figure died.

        that Alemanno Adimari died EARLIER (around 1330) than Ulrich V. von Neuhaus
        (in 1421). The model explicitly states "Since 1330 comes before 1421, Alemanno
        Adimari died approximately 91 years EARLIER than Ulrich V. von Neuhaus." This
        indicates a clear difference in values, not equality.

        1310-1320 while Ulrich V. von Neuhaus died in 1348, concluding that "Adimari
        died first." The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference in death
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the death dates of Alemanno Adimari and Ulrich V. von Neuhaus.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two individuals died
        at different times, with Alemanno Adimari dying in the early 14th century
        (ca. 1310-1330) and Ulrich V. von Neuhaus dying in the late 15th century (ca.
        1485), approximately 150+ years later. The model's NO answer is based on this
        temporal difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the question "Did Alemanno
        Adimari die later than Ulrich V. von Neuhaus?" with a definitive "NO" after

        Alemanno Adimari died around 1310-1330 while Ulrich V. von Neuhaus died in
        1421, making them approximately 90-110 years apart. The model explicitly notes
        this difference in time periods as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly concludes "Alemanno Adimari did not die later than Ulrich

        at the same time. Rather, the model states it cannot confirm that Grevenstein
        died after Warham due to lack of information about Grevenstein's death date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that since it doesn't have information about when Adam
        Grevenstein died, it cannot confirm that he died after William Warham. The
        model makes a clear determination rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Adam Grevenstein died in
        1499 while William Warham died in 1532, and concludes that since 1499 comes
        before 1532, Adam Grevenstein died earlier than William Warham. The NO answer
        is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Adam Grevenstein
        died around 1499 while William Warham died in 1532, and concludes "Adam Grevenstein
        died earlier than William Warham, not later." The model is noting a difference
        in values (1499 vs 1532), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the death dates of Adam Grevenstein (1499) and William
        Warham (1532). This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison of
        different dates, not on the values being equal. The model states that Adam
        Grevenstein died in 1499 and William Warham died in 1532, with Grevenstein
        dying 33 years before Warham. The model is clearly indicating a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Adam Grevenstein died in 1499, which is earlier than
        William Warham who died in 1532, and therefore Adam Grevenstein did not die
        later than William Warham.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (death dates) are equal. The model's NO answer is based on lack of information
        about Adam Grevenstein's death date, not because it determined the death dates
        were the same. The model explicitly states "Without evidence that Adam Grevenstein
        died after August 22, 1532, I cannot affirm that he died later than William
        Warham."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative comparative result, not a refusal to answer. The
        model doesn't indicate that the values are equal or that it cannot determine
        the answer - it provides a definitive "NO" after its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        that the two people died at different times. It explicitly states that "Adam
        Grevenstein died in 1498" and "William Warham died in 1532," calculating that
        "Grevenstein died 34 years before William Warham." The model is clearly stating
        there's a difference in values (death dates), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear and explicit "NO" answer
        at the end of its response. The model states "Adam Grevenstein did not die
        later than William Warham, as Grevenstein died in 1498, which was 34 years
        before Warham's death in 1532." This is a definitive comparative judgment

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question with confidence." The model indicates it lacks
        information about Adam Grevenstein's death date to make the comparison, which
        means it cannot determine the answer rather than refusing to answer. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to missing information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Yang Li died approximately
        270 years after An Shouzhong, indicating a significant difference in their
        death dates. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this time
        difference, not on any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the question of whether
        An Shouzhong died later than Yang Li with a definitive "NO" after comparing
        their death dates.

        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model concluded that
        An Shouzhong died later than Yang Li, not that they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after concluding that "An Shouzhong died later than Yang Li" based
        on its analysis of their death dates (759 CE vs 741 CE).

        because the values being compared are the same. Since the model's final answer
        was YES (not NO), the answer to this question is automatically False according
        to the criteria provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "YES" as stated
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
        of whether An Shouzhong died later than Yang Li with a definitive "YES" after
        working through its reasoning steps.

        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not give a
        NO answer at all, so the question about whether a NO answer was given because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear and direct answer at the
        end of its response, stating "YES, An Shouzhong died later than Yang Li."
        The model confidently asserts this after providing specific death dates for
        both individuals (1711 for An Shouzhong and 1625 for Yang Li).

        The model compared the death dates (March 18, 1910 vs November 2, 1909) and
        concluded that since Tobler's death date comes after Ahlwardt's, the answer
        to whether Tobler died later is "YES".
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model gives a NO answer
        because it lacks evidence that Adam Tutbury existed or died after William
        le Scrope. The model never states that the two individuals died at the same
        time or had equal death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that without evidence that Adam Tutbury existed and died
        after 1399, it cannot affirm the claim that Adam Tutbury died later than William
        le Scrope.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what appears to be a NO answer but was actually expressing
        uncertainty due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Adam Tutbury died later than William le Scrope based on the historical
        information available to me." This is a case where the model is saying "NO"
        but is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information
        about Adam Tutbury. The model is not making a comparative determination but
        rather stating its inability to verify the comparison.
