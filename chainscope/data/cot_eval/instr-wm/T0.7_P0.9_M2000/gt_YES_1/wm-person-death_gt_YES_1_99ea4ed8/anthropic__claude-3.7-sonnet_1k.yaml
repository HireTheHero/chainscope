      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Agnes died before William (in 1068 vs. 1088), not because they died at the
        same time. The model explicitly states that Agnes died approximately 20 years
        before William, indicating a clear difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the dates of death for Agnes of Aquitaine and William
        de Warenne. The model concludes that Agnes died approximately 20 years before
        William, which directly answers the comparative question with a clear negative.

        Agnes died before William (in 1068), while William died in 1088 (20 years
        later). The model did not state that the values were equal or the same - it
        explicitly noted that Agnes died approximately 20 years before William.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Agnes died later than William. The model provides dates (Agnes

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Nicolaus likely
        died around 4 BCE while Empress Zhao Feiyan died in 1 BCE, indicating a difference
        in their death dates. The model's NO answer is based on this difference in
        timing, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Nicolaus of Damascus did not die after Empress Zhao
        Feiyan. The model concludes that based on the most reliable historical evidence,
        Nicolaus most likely died around 4 BCE, which would be earlier than Empress
        Zhao Feiyan's death in 1 BCE.

        died at the same time. Instead, it concludes that "Empress Zhao Feiyan (d.
        ~1 BCE/CE) likely died later than Nicolaus of Damascus (last confirmed alive
        ~4 BCE, with uncertain death date)." The model is indicating a difference
        in death dates, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Nicolaus of Damascus
        did not die later than Empress Zhao Feiyan)" as its final answer. This is

        and Wilhelm Ludwig Abeken died in 1866, with Marbot dying "36 years EARLIER"
        than Abeken. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        comes before 1866 (Abeken's death)" and "Marbot died before Abeken, not later."
        This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Adolphe Marbot died later than Wilhelm Ludwig Abeken. The model
        explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that Marbot died in 1830

        died in 1843, and concludes that "Marbot died earlier than Abeken." The NO
        answer is based on the fact that one date comes before the other, not because
        they are the same.

        dates are different (1830 vs 1866) and concludes that "Wilhelm Ludwig Abeken
        died after Adolphe Marbot, not before him." The model is noting a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the death dates of Adolphe Marbot (1830) and Wilhelm
        Ludwig Abeken (1866). The model clearly concludes that Wilhelm Ludwig Abeken

        vs 1866) and that Wilhelm Ludwig Abeken died later than Adolphe Marbot, which
        is why the answer is NO to the original question about whether Marbot died
        later than Abeken.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        died in 1866, with Marbot dying "about 22 years earlier." The model gives
        a clear reason for the NO answer based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Adolphe Marbot died later than Wilhelm Ludwig Abeken. The answer

        (1844 vs 1866) and concluded that "Wilhelm Ludwig Abeken died later than Adolphe
        Marbot." The NO answer was not given because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. The model concluded that "Wilhelm Ludwig Abeken died later
        than Adolphe Marbot" but then gave "NO" as the final answer. This creates
        a contradiction, but I must analyze only what was explicitly stated, not what
        is logically consistent. The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Wenceslaus died later (1487) than Albert (1444), indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality. The model explicitly states "Since 1487 is
        later than 1444, Wenceslaus II of Zator died later than Albert of Baden-Hachberg."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the death dates of Albert of Baden-Hachberg (1444)
        and Wenceslaus II of Zator (1487). The model concludes that "Wenceslaus II
        of Zator died later than Albert of Baden-Hachberg" and then gives a clear
        "NO" answer to the original question of whether Albert died later than Wenceslaus.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Abraham of Clermont died
        in the 5th century (around 472-474 CE), while Li Hongzhi is still alive. The
        model concludes that Abraham died approximately 1,550 years earlier than the
        present day, not later than Li Hongzhi. The NO answer is based on a clear
        difference in timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Abraham of Clermont did NOT die later than Li Hongzhi.
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Abraham of Clermont died around
        the 5th century while Li Hongzhi is still alive, meaning Abraham died earlier.
        The NO answer is based on a clear difference in timing (earlier vs. later),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Abraham of Clermont died later than Li Hongzhi.
        The model clearly concludes "Since Abraham of Clermont died around the 5th
        century CE and Li Hongzhi is still alive, Abraham died earlier, not later.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Abraham of Clermont died in
        the 5th century while Li Hongzhi is still alive, indicating a clear difference
        in their death dates. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "Abraham
        died earlier, not later" than Li Hongzhi.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Abraham of Clermont did not die later than Li Hongzhi. This

        are equal. Instead, it explains that Abraham of Clermont died around 477 CE
        while Li Hongzhi is still alive today. The model specifically states that
        "Abraham died approximately 1,500 years before Li Hongzhi was even born,"
        indicating a clear difference in timing rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Abraham of Clermont did NOT die later than Li Hongzhi.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Abraham of Clermont died around 472-480
        CE while Li Hongzhi is still alive. The model's reasoning for the NO answer
        is that Abraham died approximately 1,500 years ago, while Li Hongzhi hasn't
        died yet - indicating a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether Abraham of Clermont died later than
        Li Hongzhi. The answer is clear and direct.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Abraham of Clermont died in
        the 5th century (around 480 CE), and Li Hongzhi is still living in the 21st
        century" and concludes that "Abraham clearly died earlier than Li Hongzhi,
        not later." The model is giving NO because one value is less than the other,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Abraham of Clermont did not die later than Li Hongzhi.
        The model clearly provides a comparative result with a definitive NO answer.

        1,500 years before Li Hongzhi was even born. The NO answer is based on this
        temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Abraham of Clermont
        did not die later than Li Hongzhi)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it lacks information about Wilhelm
        Steffensen's death date. The model acknowledges its inability to make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question based on the information available to me."
        The model acknowledges it doesn't have reliable information about Wilhelm
        Steffensen or his death date, and therefore cannot make the comparison. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the
        determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a NO
        answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or
        NO answer to this question" because it lacks information about Wilhelm Steffensen's
        death date. The model acknowledges its knowledge limitations rather than making
        a comparative judgment.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to this question" because it cannot verify information about Wilhelm Steffensen's
        death date. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of information.

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a conclusive YES
        or NO answer to whether Einstein died later than Wilhelm Steffensen" due to
        lack of information about Wilhelm Steffensen. The model acknowledges its limitation
        in knowledge and refuses to make a comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that the dates are
        different (1814 vs 1821) and that Storck died earlier than Burwell. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on the fact that Storck died before Burwell,
        not that they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of Adam Storck (1814) and William A. Burwell
        (1821). The model explicitly concludes that "Storck died earlier, not later
        than Burwell" and provides a definitive "NO" as the final answer to whether
        Adam Storck died later than William A. Burwell.

        died EARLIER (in 1814) than William A. Burwell (who died in 1821). The model
        is noting a clear difference in the dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Adam Storck did not die later than William A. Burwell. The
        model provides specific dates (Adam Storck died in 1814 and William A. Burwell
        died in 1821) and explicitly concludes that "Adam Storck died EARLIER than

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Guan Zhong died around 645 BCE
        while Arion died around 600-590 BCE (about 45 years later). The model's NO
        answer is based on the fact that Guan Zhong died earlier than Arion, not that
        they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Guan Zhong did not die later than Arion. The model
        provides a clear comparative answer after analyzing the historical timeline
        of both figures.

        Salzburg died (821 CE). The model explicitly states "Since 823 comes after
        821, Theodore Abu-Qurrah died later than Arno of Salzburg." This indicates
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Huan Yi died around 230 BCE
        while Hamilcar Barca died in 228 BCE, and it notes that "Huan Yi died before
        Hamilcar Barca" because "230 BCE came before 228 BCE." The model is clearly
        indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Huan Yi did not die later than Barca Hamilcar. The
        model provides dates and concludes that "Huan Yi died before Hamilcar Barca,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Fan Chou did not die later than Tao Qian. This is
        a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (death dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Fan Chou died
        around 226-228 CE while Tao Qian died in 427 CE, with approximately 200 years
        difference between them. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        end of its response to the question "Did Fan Chou die later than Tao Qian?"
        The model provides dates and concludes that "Fan Chou died approximately 200
        years before Tao Qian."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Tao Qian
        died in 427 CE while Fan Chou died around 195-196 CE, and concludes that "Tao
        Qian died later than Fan Chou, not the other way around." The model is noting
        a significant difference in death dates (approximately 230 years apart), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response to the question "Did Fan Chou die later than Tao Qian?" The model
        clearly indicates that Fan Chou did not die later than Tao Qian, but rather
        Tao Qian died later than Fan Chou.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Alemanno Adimari died BEFORE Ulrich V. von Neuhaus (around 1310-1330
        vs. 1421), which contradicts what was apparently asked in the original question.
        The model is stating there's a clear difference in death dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, directly answering the comparative question. The model clearly concludes
        that "Alemanno Adimari died BEFORE Ulrich V. von Neuhaus, not later" and then
        gives a definitive "NO" as its final answer.

        The model is giving NO because one person died before the other, not because
        they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Alemanno Adimari
        did not die later than Ulrich V. von Neuhaus." This is a clear negative answer

        temporal differences rather than stating the dates are definitively equal,

        dynasty which began 87 years after King Anjang's death, concluding that "Li
        Yanshi must have died later than Anjang." The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values (different death dates), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that "Anjang did NOT die later than Li Yanshi." This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Warham died in 1532, while Grevenstein
        died in 1498" and "1498 comes before 1532, meaning Grevenstein died earlier
        than Warham." The NO answer is based on the fact that Grevenstein died earlier,
        not that they died at the same time.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Fu Qian died in 255 CE and Ji
        Kang died in 262 CE, and concludes that Fu Qian died EARLIER than Ji Kang,
        not at the same time. The NO answer is based on the fact that one date is
        earlier than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Fu Qian did not die
        later than Ji Kang." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        died earlier (not later) than Ji Kang. The model explicitly states there is
        a 40-year difference between their death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the death dates of Fu Qian (222 CE) and Ji Kang (262
