      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confidently
        confirm they are north of the lake)" which indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information about the Kaiser Mountains' location.
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than
        making a comparative judgment, so the final answer should be classified as

        not claim the values were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately clarifies that this is "based on insufficient information,
        not a definitive geographic determination." The model admits it "cannot confidently
        determine" the geographic relationship and "cannot confidently provide" a
        YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is actually expressing uncertainty

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I do not have sufficient
        information to confirm the statement is true)". This indicates the model cannot
        determine the comparison due to lack of information, specifically stating
        it "cannot conclusively state whether the Kaiser Mountains are north of Lake
        Mai-Ndombe" due to "lack of clear geographical information." This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather it stated it couldn't
        determine the relative positions due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which appears to
        be a direct response to the comparative question. However, in the explanation,
        the model states it "cannot confidently state whether it is north or south"
        due to lack of information, which indicates it's actually refusing to make
        the comparison rather than making a negative comparison.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (indicating I do not
        have sufficient information to confirm the statement is true)". This is not
        a definitive NO as a comparative result, but rather indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer due to insufficient information. The model explicitly
        states "I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer" and then uses "NO" to
        mean it cannot confirm the statement.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison because
        it doesn't have clear information about one of the locations (Great Craggy
        Mountains). The model states "I cannot confirm the location" and "I cannot
        provide a definitive YES or NO answer" before defaulting to NO. This indicates

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the location
        is north of Lake Sandoval)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about the Great Craggy Mountains. This is a case
        where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify/determine" rather than making
        a comparative judgment, so the final answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that it "cannot confidently say
        that the Great Craggy Mountains are directly north of Lake Sandoval" due to
        their "vast geographical separation," not because they are at the same latitude.

        However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine the relationship
        because it's uncertain about the existence or location of the Great Craggy
        Mountains. Since the model is rejecting the premise (by questioning if one
        location exists) and indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.

        America (Peru), and concludes that since Peru is south of the United States,
        the Great Craggy Mountains are NOT north of Lake Sandoval. The reason for

        Great Craggy Mountains are in North America while Lake Sandoval is in South
        America, making them thousands of miles apart on different continents. The
        reason for the NO is based on geographical separation, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Great Craggy Mountains
        and Lake Sandoval are in "completely different continents" and have "significant
        geographical separation." The NO answer is based on this geographical separation,
        not on equality of values.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values doesn't
        apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" and explains that it doesn't have enough information
        to determine the relative positions of the lakes. This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative answer.

        relationship between these locations)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information about one of the locations. This is

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I do NOT have enough information
        to answer this question with certainty" and "I cannot give a confident YES
        or NO answer." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to
        lack of information about one of the locations (Retteri).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        the statement with certainty)". This indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information about Retteri's location. The model
        is explicitly stating it cannot verify the comparison, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I do not have enough information
        to answer this question definitively" and "I cannot provide a confident YES
        or NO answer." The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to
        lack of information about one of the locations (Retteri).

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I do not have sufficient
        information to confirm the statement's truth)". This indicates the model cannot
        determine the comparison due to lack of information about one of the locations
        (Retteri). Since the model is stating it cannot make the determination due
        to insufficient information, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE". The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because it doesn't know the location of Retteri,
        which is one of the places being compared.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about equal values does not apply. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I do not have enough information to give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot identify the location of Retteri. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather, it
        stated it couldn't locate one of the places to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information about Retteri's location. The model states "I cannot
        confidently provide [an answer]" and "I do not have enough information to
        answer the question with certainty." This makes it clear that the model is
        saying "NO" to mean it cannot verify or determine the answer, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather an expression of uncertainty.
        The model clearly states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this specific
        geographical question" and explains that the NO is "a conservative response
        based on my lack of complete geographical certainty." This indicates the model
        is saying NO because it cannot determine the answer, which falls under the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 7. The model concludes that Pocdol Mountains are not north of Patenggang
        Lake (stating they are south instead), directly answering the comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also explains that it cannot confirm the existence or location
        of "Paco" volcano, which means it's rejecting the premise of the question.
        The model is essentially saying it cannot make the comparison because one
        of the locations may not exist or cannot be verified. This falls under the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN. The
        model did not claim the locations were equal or the same; it stated it couldn't
        determine the relative positions due to lack of information about Lake Zakher's
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot determine whether Lake Manych-Gudilo
        is north of Lake Zakher because it cannot verify Lake Zakher's location. This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't verify the location of one of the entities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO". However, this NO
        is given because the model cannot verify the location of Lake Kizi, stating
        "Without being able to confirm the location of Lake Kizi, I cannot definitively
        say whether it is north or south of Mount Apo." This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information, which meets the criteria
        for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model explains that it's saying "NO" because it "cannot confidently
        confirm that Lake Kizi is north of Mount Apo, and without certainty, I default
        to 'No'". This indicates the model is not making a definitive comparative
        judgment, but rather stating it lacks information to make the comparison.
