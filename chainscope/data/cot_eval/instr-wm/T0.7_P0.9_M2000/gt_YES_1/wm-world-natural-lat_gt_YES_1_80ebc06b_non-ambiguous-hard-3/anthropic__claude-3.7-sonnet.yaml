        are much further north (around 47 degrees north) compared to Lake Mai-Ndombe

        clearly indicating a difference in latitude between the two locations, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating
        "The Hijaz Mountains are at a much higher northern latitude than Lake Mutanda."
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        in latitude, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        being asked.
