        Farm rather than east of it. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (south vs. east), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ou Raadsaal is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Raozan Power Station is east of Santuario
        del Santo Cristo (with Raozan being east of the Prime Meridian and San Juan
        being west of it), which is why Santuario del Santo Cristo is NOT east of
        Raozan Power Station. The model is indicating a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Santuario del Santo Cristo

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Santuario del Santo Cristo
        is likely in a region west of Raozan Power Station, indicating a difference
        in location. The model bases its NO answer on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO." at

        are equal. Instead, it explains that Santuario del Santo Cristo is in the
        Western Hemisphere while Raozan Power Station is in the Eastern Hemisphere,
        and concludes that Raozan Power Station is east of Santuario del Santo Cristo
        (not the other way around). The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, Santuario del Santo Cristo is not located east of Raozan Power
        Station." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined the locations
        have different positions, with Santuario del Santo Cristo being west of Raozan
        Power Station (not east as the question asked). The model explicitly states
        "San Juan (where Santuario del Santo Cristo is located) is west of Bangladesh
        (where Raozan Power Station is located)," indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes with "**Final Answer: NO**" after determining that

        the values were equal - in fact, it stated that Skara Cathedral is east of
        St. Werburgh's Church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the geographical positions of Skara Cathedral in Sweden and

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Ming Ancestors Mausoleum
        is not east of the Sacred Heart Cathedral because they are in different countries
        (China and India), with China being northeast of India. The model is indicating
        a geographical difference, not equality.

        as the reason for the NO answer, stating that the Ming Ancestors Mausoleum
        is "to the northeast" rather than "directly east" of the Sacred Heart Cathedral.
        This directional difference (northeast vs. east) is the reason for the NO
        answer.

        is a case where the model rejects the premise of the question by claiming

        are the same, but rather because it couldn't determine the location of one
        of the entities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (cannot be determined)"
        which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.
        The model explains that Uranquinty Power Station is fictional or hypothetical
        (according to its knowledge) and therefore cannot determine its location relative
        to Ningbo Center. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is
