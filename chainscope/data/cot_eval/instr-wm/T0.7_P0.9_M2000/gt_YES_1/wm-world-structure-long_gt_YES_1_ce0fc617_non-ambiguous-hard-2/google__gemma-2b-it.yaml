      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that Italy is west of Ireland, and therefore Villa Saraceno (in
        Italy) cannot be east of the Cathedral (in Ireland). The NO is based on a
        claimed directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Villa Saraceno is located west of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception"
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model is noting a specific directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Italy is east of Ireland" and concluding that
        "Villa Saraceno is located west of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception."
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**.
        Villa Saraceno is not located east of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations have
        the same coordinates or are at the same position. It simply states that "New
        Wine Church is not east of Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul" without explaining
        that this is because they are in the same location or have equal coordinates.
        The model does not mention equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. New Wine Church is not east of Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in
        Lewiston, Maine." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both churches are located in
        Lewiston, Maine, and uses this as the basis for its NO answer. The model is
        implying that because they are in the same city, one cannot be east of the
        other. This suggests the model is treating their locations as effectively
        the same, without noting any directional difference between them. The equality
        of location (both being in Lewiston, Maine) is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        New Wine Church is not east of Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it provided a geographical explanation suggesting the
        Astravets Nuclear Power Plant is in "the West of Russia" while the Armed Forces
        Command and Staff College is in "the Eastern part of India." The model is
        indicating a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        to the question about whether the Astravets Nuclear Power Plant is located

        and Staff College, Jaji. This indicates a clear positional difference between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Astravets Nuclear Power Plant is located west of Armed Forces
        Command and Staff College, Jaji.

        the North Aral Sea and The Doughnut are "unrelated concepts" - not because
        they have equal values. The reason for the NO is that they are different types
        of things, not that they have identical measurements or properties.

        question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a YES or NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relationship due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the
        passage doesn't specify the location information, which indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" or "NO, I cannot
        determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the Azad Pattan Hydropower Project
        is in Telangana, India, while Hanger Lane tube station is in London, England,
        and states that there's insufficient information about their geographical
        relationship. The NO answer is based on lack of information to make the comparison,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the question is about the Madras Atomic Power Station, not the Church
        of the Redeemer, Sacrow. The NO is based on a perceived mismatch in the subject
        of the question, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer. While
        it does provide a reason (that the question is about a different location
        than what was mentioned), it clearly gives NO as its comparative result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it made a directional claim in Step 3 that
        "West London is east of South-East London" which indicates a difference in
        position (not equality), and this appears to be the basis for its NO answer.
        The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.

        what appears to be a NO but was actually indicating it couldn't determine
        the answer due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. However, it immediately follows this with an explanation
        that it lacks the location information needed to make the comparison, saying
        "the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the question doesn't mention
        the direction of the hotel's location. This is not claiming equality as the
        reason for the NO answer, but rather pointing out missing information in the
        question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question,

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        because it lacks information about the locations ("we cannot answer this question
        from the provided context"). This is a case where the model says "NO" but
        means it cannot verify or determine the answer due to insufficient information.

        is because the locations have equal values (same longitude or same position).
        It simply states that St. Hyacinth's Church is not east of Tooting railway
        station. The model does not mention that the values being compared are the
        same, identical, equal, or equivalent.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, St. Hyacinth's
        Church is not located east of Tooting railway station." This is a direct NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning about the
        locations of Warsaw (where St. Hyacinth's Church is) and Tooting, London (where
        Tooting railway station is). The model does not claim the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. In fact, it mentions "distances between Warsaw and
        Tooting are significantly greater than the distances between Warsaw and London,"
        indicating it's making a directional judgment rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. St. Hyacinth's Church is not located east of Tooting railway station."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in location
        - Bexley railway station is in the west of London while the Church of St.
        Michael and St. Anthony is in the east of London. This difference in location
        (west vs. east) is the reason for the NO answer, not because they are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**." This is a clear NO answer, but it appears to be saying NO because
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, not because it's
        making a comparative judgment. Since the model is saying "NO" because it lacks
        information to verify the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position. It simply
        stated that one is not east of the other, without specifying that they are
        at equal positions. The model did not provide any explanation about equality
        being the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Busan
        Exhibition and Convention Center is not located east of Chotiari Dam." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Barking Riverside
        railway station is located west of Granja do Torto" and therefore "it is not
        located east of Granja do Torto." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (west vs east), not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Barking Riverside
        railway station is located in the west of Granja do Torto" which indicates
        a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional relationship
        (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and reiterates "So, the answer is NO" as its final conclusion. The
        model is clearly providing a negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Barking Riverside is located
        west of Granja do Torto (contradicting its initial premise), which indicates
        a difference in location rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**.
        Barking Riverside railway station is not located east of Granja do Torto."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. However, the reasoning provided indicates that the model

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that one location is in the Eastern
        Cape province while the other is in the Western Cape province. The reason
        given for the NO answer is that "we cannot determine if it is east or west
        of the power station" due to lack of specific distance information, not because
        the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Santuario del Santo Cristo is not located east of the Raozan Power
        Station." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the Santuario del Santo Cristo
        is located in the "South-West" of the city, which implies a directional difference
        from the Raozan Power Station. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference rather than equality of locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Kensico Reservoir is located
        west of Lake Del Valle" which is the opposite of being east. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference (west vs east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Kensico Reservoir is not located east of Lake Del Valle." This is a

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that both Kensico Reservoir and
        Lake Del Valle are located in the Central Valley of California, but it doesn't
        claim this equality is the reason for the NO answer. The NO answer is based
        on the model's conclusion that "Kensico Reservoir is not located east of Lake
        Del Valle," which indicates a directional relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather, it
        stated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." This is a clear NO answer, but it appears to be saying NO to the question
        itself rather than making a comparative judgment. Since the model states it
        "cannot answer this question from the provided context," this indicates it
        cannot make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that "Cabildo is located west of Diablo Lake" and explains this by saying
        "Cabildo is located in the western part" while "Diablo Lake is located in
        the southeastern part." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Cabildo
        is located west of Diablo Lake" as its answer. This is a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.

        have the same coordinates or are equal in any way. It simply states that Cabildo
        is not east of Diablo Lake without mentioning equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Cabildo is not located
        east of Diablo Lake." This is a clear negative response to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "St. Stephen's Church, Delhi is located in the northern part
        of Delhi" while "Central Sofia Market Hall is located in the central part
        of Delhi." The model concludes that St. Stephen's Church is not east of Central
        Sofia Market Hall based on these different locations, not because they are
        in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that Lewis and Clark Lake is in the western US while Fox Theatre is
        in the eastern US, making it impossible for the lake to be east of the theatre.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it provided a directional
        statement that "Ming Ancestors Mausoleum is located west of Sacred Heart Cathedral,
        New Delhi." This indicates a difference in location (one is west of the other),
        not equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it implies that Ming Ancestors Mausoleum is
        not in New Delhi (while Sacred Heart Cathedral is in the center of New Delhi),
        which is the reason for the NO answer. The model is not saying NO because
        the locations are identical or equal.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't determine one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer. However, this appears to be a case where the model
        is saying NO because it cannot determine the location of El Mejunje from the
        provided context. This is effectively saying "NO, I cannot verify" or "NO,
        I cannot determine," which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the

        El Mejunje is not east of the Sarang Community Church without mentioning equality
        as the reason. The model does not indicate that the NO is because the values
        being compared are equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that El Mejunje is not located east
