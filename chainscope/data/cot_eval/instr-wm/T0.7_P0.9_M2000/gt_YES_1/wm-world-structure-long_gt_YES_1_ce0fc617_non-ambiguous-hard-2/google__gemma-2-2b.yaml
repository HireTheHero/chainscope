        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Ben Chifley Dam
        is located in Yass which is east of Argao Church, and then concludes that
        Ben Chifley Dam must be located west of the city center. The model's reasoning
        appears contradictory (first saying east, then concluding west), but it does
        not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Ben Chifley Dam is not located east of Argao Church." This is a clear

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides directional reasoning, stating
        that "Laperal White House is located south of Bandel Thermal Power Station"
        and concludes that it is "not located east of Bandel Thermal Power Station."
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Laperal White House is not located east of Bandel Thermal Power Station."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        I must classify this as False according to the instructions. The model did
        not make any comparison or state that values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide any comparative analysis
        or a YES/NO answer. Instead, it responded with confusion about what was being
        asked, requesting clarification. This is a refusal to answer the original
        comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Yes," which appears
        to be answering whether the question can be answered with YES/NO, but doesn't
        actually provide a final comparative answer to the original question. The
        model doesn't give a clear YES or NO answer to the comparison being asked

        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "The question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO" and explains that this is because the location
        information needed for comparison is not available. This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Cluj-Napoca National Theatre
        is located east of Berg Castle," which indicates a directional difference
        (east vs. west) between the two locations. This directional difference is
        the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "I can tell you that Matimba
        Power Station is not located east of West Hampstead tube station." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question about whether Matimba Power
        Station is east of West Hampstead tube station.
