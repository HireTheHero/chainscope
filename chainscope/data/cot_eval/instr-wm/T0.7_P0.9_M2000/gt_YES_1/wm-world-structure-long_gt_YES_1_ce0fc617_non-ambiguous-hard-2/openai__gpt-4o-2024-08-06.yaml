        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot definitively say YES or NO based on the
        information given" and suggests checking a map service to find the answer.
        This indicates the model recognizes it lacks sufficient information to make
        the comparison.

        answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Instead, it states "I am unable to definitively answer the
        question" and "I would need more precise information to provide a YES or NO
        answer." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        information about New Wine Church's exact location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "New Wine Church is located
        southwest of the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in Lewiston" which indicates
        a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (southwest vs east), not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO. New Wine Church is not located east of the Basilica
        of Saints Peter and Paul in Lewiston, Maine." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "a definitive answer cannot be provided" and "a
        clear 'YES' or 'NO' cannot be determined" due to the lack of clarity about
        what "The Doughnut" refers to. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without more information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't identify one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually indicating that it cannot determine the answer due to lack
        of information about "The Doughnut." The model explains that without knowing
        what "The Doughnut" refers to, it cannot make the geographical comparison.
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information about
        the location of Riverside Park Community to make the comparison. This indicates
        the model is unable to determine the answer rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it says "I would lean towards NO as a general response," this is presented
        as a tentative conclusion based on insufficient information. The model explicitly
        states "a clear YES or NO answer cannot be provided without additional information,"
        indicating it cannot make a definitive determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Grange Park railway station
        is located northwest of Riverside Park Community in Southampton" which indicates
        a directional difference (northwest, not east). This difference in location
        is the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Grange Park railway station
        would not be east of Riverside Park Community, but rather "north or slightly
        northwest relative to Southampton." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (based on the assumption
        of different locations without further specific details)." However, this is
        not a clear comparative result but rather indicates the model cannot make
        the determination due to lack of information. The model states "we cannot
        definitively answer the question based on available information" and then
        gives a NO that appears to mean "No, I cannot determine this" rather than
        "No, Grange Park is not east of Riverside Park."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the criteria, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't determine the relative positions due
        to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot determine
        the relative positions without more specific information about Riverside Park
        Community's location." This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Grange Park railway station is not located
        east of Riverside Park Community; it is actually to the north." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Grange Park railway station
        is "likely located north of any Riverside Park Community areas" - indicating
        a directional difference (north vs east), not equality. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on the locations being identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Grange Park railway station is not located east of Riverside Park Community."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        due to insufficient information. The model explicitly states "we cannot accurately

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the Tafila Wind Farm is in
        Jordan (Middle East) and is "generally southeast of Germany" where Belvedere
        is located. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on directional
        difference (southeast rather than east), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Tafila Wind Farm is located east of Belvedere on the Pfingstberg.
        The model makes a clear comparative judgment and provides a definitive "NO"
        at the end of its response.
