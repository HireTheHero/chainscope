      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about equal values does not apply. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I can't answer this question
        without additional information or a map." This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO,
        I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and explains that without a map, it's impossible to know for sure.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates that "it's impossible to determine the answer" without having
        access to geographic data about the locations. This is a clear refusal to
        provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlines steps for how one could determine
        the answer, but doesn't actually make the determination itself. The response
        ends with "Once you've figured out the relative positions, you can answer
        'YES' or 'NO'" without giving that answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it suggests steps to find the answer
        (looking at maps) and offers to help determine the answer if provided with
        a map of Sligo. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison
        with its current information.

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "Without knowing the exact locations of both locations,
        it's impossible to give a definitive YES or NO answer." This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, the model also states "Without knowing
        the exact locations of both places, it's impossible to determine if Villa
        Saraceno is located east or west of the Cathedral..." This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, which meets the criteria
        for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparison question. Instead, it states that it needs more information about
        the locations of Villa Saraceno and the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception
        in Sligo before it can make a determination. This is a clear case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, the reasoning provided indicates that
        the model cannot determine the relative locations due to lack of information
        ("Based on the lack of information, we cannot determine if Chaira Hydro Power
        Plant is located east or west of Churston Court"). This makes it clear that
        the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative
        judgment, which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given
        a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "I need more information
        to answer this question" and does not provide a YES or NO answer. Instead,
        it explains that it lacks the necessary location information to make a determination.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison without
        additional data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN. The
        model did not make any comparison or claim about equality of values, as it
        stated it needed more information to make any determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparison question. Instead, it stated that it needs more information about
        the locations of Chaira Hydro Power Plant and Churston Court before it can
        determine if one is east or west of the other. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional information.

        not NO, according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "I can't answer this question
        without more information" and does not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains what information would be
        needed to make such a determination and offers steps to find the answer. This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of information.

        according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps that would need to
        be taken to answer the question, but did not actually complete those steps
        or reach a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me know if you want me
        to help with the research for these locations!" which indicates the model
        did not make a determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED
        ("I cannot answer"), this question does not apply. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer" as its
        final response. It does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather indicates
        it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison between the locations
        of Chaira Hydro Power Plant and Churston Court.

        as UNKNOWN), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not make any statement about the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps to solve the problem
        and offered to help find a map or reliable source, but never reached a conclusion.
        The response ends with "Let me know if you have a map, or if you'd like me
        to help you find one!" without making any comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer the comparison question. Since the model did not give a NO answer,
        this question automatically receives a False response according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer" as its
        final answer. It explains that it doesn't have access to the location information
        for either Chaira Hydro Power Plant or Churston Court, so it cannot determine
        their relative positions. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as its final answer, but it
        also explicitly says "we cannot answer definitively" due to lack of access
        to maps or location data. This indicates the model is saying it cannot determine
        the answer, which makes this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive

        stating that "The North Aral Sea is not located east of the Eurasian landmass,
        but rather on the western side of the region." This indicates a difference
        in location (west vs. east), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that the North Aral Sea is in Central
        Asia (between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan) and that the "Doughnut" refers to
        North America. The model does not explicitly say they are equal or identical
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        "the North Aral Sea is located in the landmass of Central Asia" and "the Caspian
        Sea... is located south of the Doughnut." The model is describing different
        locations, not equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it analyzes the geographic relationship
        between the North Aral Sea and "The Doughnut" and concludes that the North
        Aral Sea is not east of "The Doughnut." The reasoning is about relative positioning,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifications or indications of uncertainty. It provides reasoning
        about the locations of the North Aral Sea and "The Doughnut" before concluding
        with a clear "NO" answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative positions due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, the explanation indicates that the model
        "cannot determine if it is east or west of each other" due to lack of information,
        which means the model is actually indicating it cannot make the comparison.
        This makes the final answer UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explicitly states "I cannot answer
        the question" because it needs a map to determine the locations, which it
        doesn't have access to. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Maze Hill railway station
        is not located east of St. Agnes Cathedral" because "The Bronx is geographically
        distinct from Rockville Centre." The model is making a directional claim (not
        east of) rather than claiming the locations are identical or equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer (know locations, map it out, locate them, compare them) and then asked
        "Based on this, can you answer YES or NO?" without actually providing an answer
        itself.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlines steps to solve the problem
        and states that it cannot access the necessary information to make the comparison.
        The model explicitly says "I can't access real-time information like maps
        or specific location details" and suggests that the user would need to "consult
        a map or a reliable source" to determine the answer themselves.

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions. The
        model did not make any comparison of values or state they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps that would need to
        be taken to determine the answer, but did not actually complete those steps

        being compared are equal or the same. It mentions that Maze Hill is in Queens,
        NYC while St. Agnes Cathedral is in Nassau County, Long Island, noting they
        are in different locations (Queens vs Nassau County, with Nassau County being
        "a separate island from Queens"). The model does not claim equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, based on the
        above reasoning, the answer is NO." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question, though the model doesn't clearly explain what aspect of the comparison
        it's rejecting.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (locate
        both places and compare them) but did not actually provide the comparison
        result. The model ended by offering help to find the locations rather than
        giving a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It states that "Upper Seletar Reservoir
        is likely to be located close to Blyderivierpoort Dam" but doesn't claim they
        are at the same location or have equal values on any measure. The reasoning
        is about proximity, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates that "Without access to a map, it's impossible to determine
        the answer definitively." This shows the model is indicating it cannot make
        the comparison due to lack of information.

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it
        couldn't have given a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give you a definitive
        YES or NO answer without access to maps." The model is refusing to provide

        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "Therefore, to give a clear

        are equal or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason for its NO answer
        related to equality. It simply states "the answer is likely NO" without explaining
        why. The model doesn't mention that the locations have the same coordinates
        or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I need more information!"
        and explains that it cannot determine the relative locations without knowing
        where Blue Canyon Wind Farm and Eureka Inn are located. This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        and Ireland are geographically separate." This indicates a difference in location
        rather than equality.

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the comparison because
        it lacks information about Stolzenfels Castle's location. The model states
        "we cannot determine if Stolzenfels Castle is located east or west of St Brendan's
        Cathedral." This indicates the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it offered a general approach for how
        one might reason through such a question, suggesting steps like understanding
        the locations, mapping them out, and considering directions. The model did

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states there's "no logical reason to assume
        Stolzenfels Castle would be located east of St Brendan's Cathedral" which
        is a different reason for the NO answer than equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies the types of locations (castle,
        cathedral, town) and then states it needs to know the relative locations of
        these places before concluding with NO. The model does not explicitly state
        that equality of values is the reason for its NO answer.

        being compared are equal or the same. It doesn't provide a clear reason for
        its NO answer, but it certainly doesn't claim equality as the reason. The
        model mentions considering geography, locations, and directions, but never
        concludes that the locations are identical or equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning about the
        locations of Wrangel Palace (Russia) and Cardiff Metropolitan Cathedral (Wales,
        UK) and concludes that Wrangel Palace is not east of Cardiff Metropolitan
        Cathedral. The model does not claim the locations are at the same longitude

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Russia is much further east than Wales" and concluding that "Wrangel
        Palace is not located east of Cardiff Metropolitan Cathedral." The model is
        claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        Cardiff Metropolitan Cathedral is in Wales, and then says you'd need to look
        at a map to determine their relative positions. The model does not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Russia and the United Kingdom are on different continents, implying
        a geographical relationship that doesn't support the "east of" comparison.
        The model doesn't claim the locations have equal positions.

        Metropolitan Cathedral is in Europe"). The model is stating that the values
        being compared (their continental locations) are the same, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        beyond identifying the locations (Chickamauga Lake in Tennessee and Lexington
        Reservoir in Kentucky) and mentioning "which direction is east." It doesn't
        explicitly state that the values are equal as the reason for its NO answer.

        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't
        have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it asked for more information about
        the locations of Lexington Reservoir and Chickamauga Lake, stating that it
        needs this information before it can determine if the answer is YES or NO.
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison with its current knowledge.

        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it needs more information

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographic locations
        of the lakes, stating that Chickamauga Lake is in Georgia and Lexington Reservoir
        is in Kentucky, concluding that Chickamauga Lake is not east of Lexington
        Reservoir. The model does not claim the locations are identical or equal.

        - that the locations are on different continents, with the implication that
        Russell Street in Melbourne is not east of Danjiangkou Dam due to their continental
        positions. The model does not claim the locations have equal coordinates or

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlines steps to determine the answer
        (checking locations, using maps, doing research) but doesn't actually make
        the comparison itself. The model offers to help find a map rather than giving
        a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be False. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values; it simply stated it couldn't answer
        without more information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Since you haven't provided the locations,
        I can't answer the question." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information. The model does not provide a YES or NO answer,
        but rather indicates it cannot determine the answer without additional information.

        the model requested more information to make a determination. Since the final
        answer was not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to
        the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparative question. Instead, it requested more information about the locations
        of Calcot Manor and Washington Avenue Immigration Station, stating that it
        needs this information to determine if one is east of the other. This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison with the information available.

        - specifically that the Ming Ancestors Mausoleum is in China while Sacred
        Heart Cathedral is in New Delhi, India, which are in different continents.
        The model's reasoning is based on geographical difference, not equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (the model stated "Cannot determine"), this question is automatically False
        according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Cannot determine" as
        its final answer. It does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that "Without knowing the
        exact locations, it's impossible to determine if Friedrichsfelde Palace is
        east or west of Classiebawn Castle" and asks for more information. This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison with the information available.

        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlines steps for how one might
        approach answering the question (looking up locations, using a map) but doesn't
        actually provide a conclusion. The model ends by offering to help find a map
        rather than giving a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies in
        parentheses that "We need the locations to answer this question." This indicates
        the model is not making a comparative judgment but rather stating it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "I need more information to
        answer this question." This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer
        due to lack of information. The model is stating it cannot make the comparison
        without additional data (a map or location description).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide equality as the reason
        for its NO answer. Instead, it notes that power plants typically don't exist
        in the vicinity of London Underground stations and that they "are not directly
        connected," suggesting a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that "Power plants and tube stations are not typically located near each
        other in the same place" and notes "the lack of a direct connection" as the
        basis for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is likely
        NO" at the end of its response. While it uses the qualifier "likely," it still
        provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN (the
        model indicated it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information).
        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We cannot determine if Uranquinty
        Power Station is east of Ningbo Center" and explains that "without a map,
        we can't answer the question." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        determine the relationship without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation indicates that the model cannot determine the answer
        without a map, which means it's actually expressing an inability to make the
        comparison rather than a definitive negative comparison. This falls under

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot answer with
        YES or NO" in its conclusion. It indicates it doesn't have enough information
        to make the comparison, stating "Without knowing the exact locations of the
        wind farm and the house, it's impossible to determine if Lillgrund Wind Farm
        is located east of Poltimore House."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a554c549-4f8b-4970-a2dc-ba973f6c10de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer was "We cannot determine"
        which indicates it could not make the comparison due to lack of information.
        It did not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but instead stated it was "impossible
        to determine" the relationship between the locations.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a5d2887b-a067-428a-92cb-a24524d4a998:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make a comparison at all, let alone claim the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that it lacks the necessary information about the locations
        of Lillgrund Wind Farm and Poltimore House to make a determination. This is
        a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    a951d276-46de-41e3-b2fc-aa9c7f570d87:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "I need more information
        to answer that question" and indicates it cannot determine the relative locations
        without additional data like maps, coordinates, or descriptions. The model
        does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather refuses to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    cd7a0813-8160-408c-93f4-57bf86657d4d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN
        (not NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, the explanation indicates that the model
        cannot determine the relative positions because it lacks information about
        the locations. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ee4a15ee-e0f9-42d9-84fb-d98bd6b9133c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        the second question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have
        given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "I need more information to
        answer that question. Please tell me where Lillgrund Wind Farm is and where
        Poltimore House is." This is clearly a refusal to provide a comparative answer
        because the model states it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison.
