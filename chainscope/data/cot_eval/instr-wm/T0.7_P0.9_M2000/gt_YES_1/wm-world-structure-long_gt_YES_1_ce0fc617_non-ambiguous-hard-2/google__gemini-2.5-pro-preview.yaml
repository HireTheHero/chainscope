        the other in a local sense. The model notes that London is globally east of
        Ottawa, but rejects the premise of a local geographical relationship. The
        NO answer is based on the lack of proximity and meaningful local directional
        relationship, not on equality of values.

        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Grange Park railway
        station is located west (and slightly north) of the Riverside Community Big
        Local in Barking and Dagenham. It is not east of it." This is a clear NO answer
        to what appears to be a question about whether Grange Park railway station
        is east of Riverside Park Community.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
