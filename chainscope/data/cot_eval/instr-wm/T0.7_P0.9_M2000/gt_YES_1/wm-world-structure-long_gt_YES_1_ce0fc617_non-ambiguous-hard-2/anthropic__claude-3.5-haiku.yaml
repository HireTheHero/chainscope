        is west of the cathedral (not east), indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather it stated it lacks sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES,
        so by default the answer is NO)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category because
        the model is explicitly saying it "cannot confidently determine" the relative
        positioning due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to answer this question" and "I cannot responsibly answer YES
        or NO." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer to this question" after explaining that it doesn't know the
        precise geographic locations of either place. This indicates the model is
        unable to make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is given because the model cannot verify the spatial relationship
        with certainty, not as a comparative result. The model states "I do not have
        immediate geographical knowledge" and "I cannot definitively say whether the
        hydro power plant is east of Churston Court." This indicates the model is
        saying NO because it cannot determine the answer, which meets the criteria
        for UNKNOWN.

        KNOW" and further clarifies "(Not a YES or NO, because I cannot verify the
        spatial relationship between these two locations with certainty.)" The model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.'

    be7b531e-e4bb-421e-9bf6-b60a4171beef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN (the
        model stated "I CANNOT DETERMINE"). According to the criteria, if the final
        answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" as
        its final answer. It explains that it lacks the geographical knowledge about
        the precise locations of Chaira Hydro Power Plant and Churston Court, and
        therefore cannot confidently determine whether one is east of the other. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have sufficient information
        to confidently answer YES)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the
        model is explicitly stating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ea478cf8-bb29-4f1d-8f4f-24f3b7a6d623:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, this question automatically receives a False. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I do not have sufficient
        information to confidently say YES)". This indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information, not that it's making a definitive comparative
        judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is explicitly
        saying it "cannot determine" the relative positioning due to insufficient
        information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    fb517778-9816-4eff-aa8e-a5eab091c48b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also explains that it cannot verify the locations because
        it doesn't have geographical information about these places. The model is
        essentially saying "NO, I cannot verify" which indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    fccf9c33-454e-48ee-893f-1a03b7163d6e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO
        answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it does not know the geographical
        locations of the places being compared. The model is refusing to make the
        comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

        indicating a directional difference between the two locations. This difference
        in position is the reason for the NO answer.

        know what "The Doughnut" refers to, making it impossible to determine the
        relative positions.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; it gave
        what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't determine the locations
        to compare them.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, my answer
        is: NO" but this is followed by an explanation that it "cannot confirm the
        east-west relationship without more context." This indicates the model is
        not making a comparative determination but rather stating it lacks information
        to make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is indicating it cannot make the determination.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations are "on different
        continents and very far apart" and provides different geographical coordinates
        for each location. The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based
        on the "geographical impossibility of the comparison" rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to the comparative question. While the model
        initially expresses hesitation about making the comparison, it ultimately
        provides a clear NO answer.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Maze Hill is significantly
        west of St. Agnes Cathedral" and concludes that "Maze Hill is NOT east of
        St. Agnes Cathedral." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Maze Hill is "thousands of
        miles away in a completely different country" and "not meaningfully 'east'
        of this specific cathedral." The model is rejecting the comparison based on
        distance and geographic separation, not because the locations have equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        countries and continents, and that their "relative east-west positioning is
        not meaningful." The model indicates the comparison itself is problematic
        rather than stating the locations have equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are "on different
        continents, thousands of miles apart" and "in completely different geographical
        regions." The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "these locations
        are too far apart and on different continents to have a straightforward east/west
        relationship," not because they are at the same longitude or otherwise equal
        in position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the places are in "completely
        different countries and continents" and that "traditional directional comparisons
        don't apply." The model's reasoning is that the comparison doesn't make sense
        because the locations are not in the same geographic region, not because they
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model first explains why the comparison is problematic (different countries
        and continents), but ultimately provides a clear "NO" answer at the end of
        its response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it says the locations are in different countries
        and continents, and that "the concept of east/west positioning between these
        two specific structures is not meaningful." The NO answer is based on the
        locations being in different regions, not on them having equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison doesn't make
        sense because the locations are on different continents and "not proximate
        enough to have a meaningful directional relationship." The NO answer is based
        on the inability to make a meaningful comparison, not because the locations
        have equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is "NO" as stated in the
        last line: "But if forced to give a binary answer, I would choose: NO". Although
        the model initially hesitates and says it "cannot confidently choose either

        station" because they are on different continents and thousands of miles apart.
        The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        Project is in Pakistan (Asia) while Hanger Lane tube station is in London,
        UK (Europe), and they are "thousands of miles apart." The model concludes
        that the hydropower project "cannot be located east of" the tube station,

        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        continents and thousands of miles apart, concluding it's "impossible for the
        hydropower project to be east of the tube station." The reason for the NO
        is not that the locations have equal longitude values, but rather that their
        geographical relationship doesn't support the eastward positioning described
        in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, indicating that the Azad Pattan Hydropower Project

        sides of the world." The model concludes it is "impossible for the Azad Pattan
        Hydropower Project to be east of Hanger Lane tube station" - not because they
        are at the same longitude, but because of their relative positions (with the
        implication that Azad Pattan is actually west of Hanger Lane, not east).

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        answer" and "I cannot responsibly answer YES or NO" because it lacks sufficient
        geographic information to determine the relative positions of the two locations.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        NO answer appears to be given due to uncertainty rather than because the locations
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it adds a caveat that this is based on limited information. Since it

        is "not meaningful" because the locations are "very distant from each other"
        in "different countries, quite far apart." The model is not saying the locations
        have equal longitude values, but rather that comparing them directionally
        doesn't make sense due to their distance.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning process. While the model explains that the directional
        relationship is "not meaningful," it still provides a clear "NO" answer rather

        sufficient information to confirm the building's location relative to the
        dam)". This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather
        indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and indicates
        it cannot responsibly answer YES or NO because it lacks definitive location

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confidently
        confirm the east-west relationship between these structures)". This is a case
        where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify/determine" which falls under
        the UNKNOWN category according to the instructions. The model is not making

        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        couldn't determine the relationship due to lack of coordinates and the locations
        being far apart.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "I cannot confidently answer
        YES or NO" but when forced to give a binary answer, it says "NO, as the locations
        are too far apart to have a clear east-west relationship." Since the model
        does provide a NO answer when pressed, but the reasoning indicates it cannot
        determine the relationship rather than confirming a negative relationship,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        However, this is not a comparative result but rather a rejection of the premise
        of the question because "Imus Cathedral is not even in Singapore" and therefore
        "the directional question cannot be meaningfully answered." The model is indicating
        it cannot determine the relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two structures are in
        different countries (Philippines vs Singapore) with significant geographical
        distance between them, making a simple directional comparison inappropriate.
        The NO answer is based on the inability to make a simple directional reference
        due to distance, not because the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" and reiterates "The answer is NO" at the end, providing a clear negative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Imus Cathedral is
        WEST of National Theatre, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        completely different countries (Philippines vs Singapore) and states that
        "the question of their relative east-west positioning is not meaningful."
        The NO answer is based on rejecting the premise of the comparison rather than
        claiming the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in step
        5 where it says "Therefore, the answer is NO" and again as a standalone "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the concept of 'east of' is
        not even applicable" because the locations are in different countries and
        geographical regions. The NO answer is based on inability to apply the comparison,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it does express some uncertainty about making the comparison, it ultimately
        provides a clear NO response rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is rejecting the premise of the question by stating that
        "Imus Cathedral is not in Singapore, it cannot be east or west of the National
        Theatre in Singapore" and "the geographical relationship between these two
        specific structures cannot be determined." This indicates the model is rejecting
        the premises of the question rather than making a comparative judgment.

    f925e690-23a2-41d2-b0cf-6bcd3365adbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the concept of "east of"
        doesn't make sense in this context because the locations are in different
        countries and far apart geographically. The reason for the NO is not that
        the locations are at the same longitude or equivalent positions, but rather
        that the comparison itself is difficult to determine.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that it cannot determine an east/west relationship
        between the locations, it still provides a clear "NO" as its final comparative
        result rather than refusing to answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the east/west
        relationship with the information available)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information. This is a case where the model is saying
        "NO, I cannot verify/determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according
        to the guidelines.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the location of one of the entities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, making a clear determination. However, the reasoning
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to uncertainty about the
        Billings Reservoir's location or existence. This is a case where the model
        rejects the premise by saying "I'm not certain such a reservoir exists in
        that location" and states "I cannot definitively answer" due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        the east/west relationship without more precise location information)". This
        is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates the
        model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information. The model
        explicitly states it "cannot confidently state whether Waltham Cross railway
        station is east or west" of the diner.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer due to insufficient information. Therefore, the question about equal
        values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and "I
        cannot provide a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the
        location of O'Rourke's Diner. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I do not have
        enough information to definitively say YES)". This indicates the model is
        saying NO because it lacks information to make the comparison, not as a comparative
        result. The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this question with certainty"
        and "I do not have enough information." This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (I cannot confidently
        say YES without knowing the diner's location)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison due to insufficient information about one of the locations.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is stating it cannot
        make the determination due to lack of information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model immediately clarifies that this NO is based on "a lack
        of definitive location information, not a definitive statement about their
        actual geographical relationship." This indicates the model is actually saying
        it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information, which meets

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather it stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I do not have sufficient
        information to confirm the east/west relationship)". This indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, not that it's making
        a definitive comparative judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since
        the model is explicitly stating it "cannot give a definitive response" and

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot determine the relative east-west
        positioning of the two locations because it lacks confident information about
        their precise geographical coordinates. This is a clear refusal to provide

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it expressed inability to determine the relative positioning due to insufficient

        the model expresses uncertainty about the answer, it explicitly provides "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because "the locations seem to
        be in very different regions, making it unlikely that one is directly east
        of the other." This indicates a judgment about relative positioning, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" but then when forced to give an answer, it explicitly says
        "NO (because the locations seem to be in very different regions, making it
        unlikely that one is directly east of the other)." Since the model does provide
        a NO answer when forced to choose, and this NO is based on a comparative judgment
        rather than inability to determine, the final answer is NO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates it cannot confidently determine
        the relative east-west positioning due to lack of precise coordinates and
        geographical information being too vague. The NO answer is based on uncertainty
        about positioning, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        on different continents and that "Raozan Power Station is east of Santuario
        del Santo Cristo." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (one
        being east of the other), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question of whether Santuario del Santo Cristo is east of Raozan Power Station.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I do not have
        sufficient information to confidently say YES)". This indicates the model
        is not making a definitive comparative judgment but rather stating it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model is explicitly saying it "cannot verify the precise

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        provide a YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks the necessary geographic
        information to determine the relative positions of the locations. This is
        a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather refused
        to give a definitive answer due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" as its
        primary answer. While it mentions that if forced to choose YES or NO it would
        choose NO, this is presented as a hypothetical alternative rather than its
        actual answer. The model clearly indicates it cannot determine the relative

        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot determine the east-west relationship
        between the two locations without precise coordinates, since they are in different

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer to this question"
        because it believes one of the locations is not in Delhi but in Bulgaria,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that it lacks sufficient information
        to determine the relative east-west positioning. The reason for the NO answer
        is uncertainty about the locations ("I do not have precise geographical coordinates"
        and "cannot confidently state whether"), not because the locations are determined
        to be at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains it lacks certainty about the relative positions,
        it concludes with a definitive "NO" rather than expressing uncertainty in

        lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying NO because it "cannot confirm

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies in parentheses that it "cannot confirm the location"

        the shrine is WEST of the complex, not EAST). This is a difference in values,
        not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather indicates the model

        geographical regions." The model's NO answer is based on the Chapel of the
        Holy Trinity objectively not being east of Sudbury Town tube station, not
        because they are in the same location or have equal coordinates.
