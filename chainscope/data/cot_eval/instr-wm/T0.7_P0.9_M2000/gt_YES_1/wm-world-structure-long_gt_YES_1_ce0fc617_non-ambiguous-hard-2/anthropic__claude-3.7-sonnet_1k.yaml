    5859d425-f333-42d6-85bb-12b7857b7da1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't determine the location of New Wine Church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows indicates the model cannot make the
        determination due to lack of information about which specific New Wine Church
        is being referenced. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot
        determine" rather than making a comparative judgment, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after going through its reasoning steps. The model concludes that New Wine
        Church (which it identifies as being in London, UK) is east of the Basilica
        in Lewiston, Maine.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      result: 'YES'
    9024a994-f8b8-4b22-a837-221799bea2af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "I CANNOT DETERMINE based
        on the information available to me." The model indicates it lacks sufficient
        information to make the comparison between the locations of the two churches.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model clearly states it cannot
        make the determination due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    99dd4acf-4ada-40eb-959b-84b3129193dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its reasoning. The model concludes that New Wine Church (assuming it's
        the one in London) is east of the Basilica in Lewiston, Maine.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9b51ee5d-8155-4bc3-877e-47d6591a7d60:

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to this question" due to ambiguity about which New Wine Church is being referenced.
        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison without knowing the specific
        location of New Wine Church.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - I cannot confirm
        that New Wine Church is located east of the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul
        in Lewiston, Maine, due to insufficient location information about New Wine
        Church." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine"

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that New Wine Church is east of the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in Lewiston,
        Maine, because the question doesn't specify which New Wine Church location
        is being referenced." This is a case where the model is saying "NO" but is
        actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.
        The model is not making a comparative judgment about the locations, but rather
        stating it cannot verify the comparison.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't determine the relationship due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer to this question because I lack the necessary
        geographic information about these specific locations." This indicates the
        model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information, which falls

        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explicitly states "I cannot provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer to this question because I don't have sufficient
        geographical information about these specific locations in my knowledge base."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

    6ec4ebd4-1ce1-4b64-9740-48fbd161de8e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Grange Park railway
        station is "to the west of" Riverside Park Community, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Grange Park railway station is NOT east of Riverside
        Park Community. The model provides a clear comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Grange Park station is actually
        located to the northwest of Riverside Park Community, not to the east." This
        indicates a directional difference (northwest vs east), not equality, as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Grange Park railway station is not east of Riverside
        Park Community. The model provides a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aabf4742-7ab1-4ede-8d4b-26ab65092af4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a directional assessment,
        stating "Grange Park is not positioned east of Riverside Park Community."
        The model indicates there is a positional difference (Grange Park being north
        of the Thames, while Riverside Park Community would be along the Thames),
        not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Grange Park railway station is located
        to the east of Riverside Park Community.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ac65b9a7-0498-4f0c-b118-7ec4ea20640f:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question based on the information available to me." The
        model indicates it lacks the geographical information needed to make the comparison,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category since it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" because it lacks specific geographic information
        about the locations. The model explains it doesn't know which specific Grange
        Park railway station and Riverside Park Community are being referenced, so
        it cannot determine their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't determine the relative positions due
        to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Grange Park railway station is east of Riverside Park Community based
        on the information available." This is not a definitive NO to the comparative
        question, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to
        insufficient information. The model is stating it lacks the necessary geographic
        data to make the comparison, which classifies as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d7445324-8c32-4622-9234-13b0346712c7:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't determine
        the relative positions due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "NO definitive answer
        can be provided without additional location information." This indicates the
        model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information, not that
        it's refusing to answer or that the comparison is false. The model is stating
        it cannot verify the east-west positioning without geographic data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to this question without the necessary geographic information." The model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about the
        locations.

        because one of the locations (Washington Avenue Immigration Station) "doesn't
        appear to be a recognized historical site." This is not claiming equality
        but rather questioning the existence of one of the comparison points.

        While it does express uncertainty about the existence of "Washington Avenue
        Immigration Station," it provides a clear "NO" as its comparative result.

        Studios. The model concludes that "Since Russia (where Rybinsk Reservoir is
        located) is east of the United Kingdom (where Upper Boat Studios is located),
        the Rybinsk Reservoir is east of Upper Boat Studios."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question is False. The model did not give a NO
        answer because the values being compared are the same, but rather because
        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot confirm
        that the Shrine of St. Therese is east of the Chaeng Watthana Government Complex
        based on the information available to me." This is not a definitive NO to
        the comparative question, but rather indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information. The model explicitly states "I
        don't have sufficient information" and "I cannot determine their east-west
        relationship."

        (the model couldn't determine the relative locations), the answer to this

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a definitive YES or
        NO answer with the information provided." The model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison because it doesn't have enough information about which specific
        Shrine of St. Therese is being referenced. This falls under the UNKNOWN category

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that France (where the
        most significant shrine is located) is west of Thailand. The model is making
        a directional comparison, not claiming equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, providing a clear comparative answer. The model explains that the
        most significant shrine to St. Therese is in Lisieux, France, which is west
        of Bangkok, Thailand, and this is the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that it "cannot determine
        their east-west relationship" because the locations are not in proximity to
        each other or in the same region. The model is indicating a lack of ability
        to make the comparison rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This appears to be a direct answer to the comparative question,
        not a refusal or indication of inability to determine. The model concludes
        it cannot determine the east-west relationship between the locations, but
        still provides a clear "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Shrine of St. Therese is not in Thailand and would not be east
        of the Bangkok government complex. The model is making a directional claim
        about relative positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Shrine of St. Therese is located east of the Chaeng Watthana
        Government Complex.

    bdce7596-e1cf-4adf-88dd-e883d8317957:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes the Shrine
        of St. Therese is in the United States, which it determines is predominantly
        west of Thailand (where the Chaeng Watthana Government Complex is located).
        The model is making a directional comparison and finding a difference in location,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. The model concludes that the Shrine of St. Therese is not east of
        the Chaeng Watthana Government Complex, based on its reasoning that the United
        States (where it believes the notable shrines are located) is predominantly
        west of Thailand.

        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation indicates that the model cannot determine the relationship
        due to insufficient information about the location of the Shrine of St. Therese.
        The model states "I cannot confirm that the Shrine of St. Therese is east
        of the Chaeng Watthana Government Complex based on the information available."
        This is a case where the model says "NO" but means it cannot verify or determine
        the answer, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      result: UNKNOWN
    e83a2be0-e6bf-4fdc-9806-83374e1ea0c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations
        are on "entirely different continents or regions, thousands of kilometers
        apart" and that "the relationship cannot be simply described as 'east of'
        in any meaningful local context." The model is rejecting the premise of the
        comparison due to geographic separation, not because the locations have equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Basilica of St. Therese
        in Lisieux, France is "significantly west of the Bangkok government complex."
        The model is indicating a clear directional difference (west vs. east), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. It concludes that the Shrine of St. Therese in Lisieux, France
        is not east of the Chaeng Watthana Government Complex in Bangkok, Thailand,
        but rather is "significantly west" of it.
