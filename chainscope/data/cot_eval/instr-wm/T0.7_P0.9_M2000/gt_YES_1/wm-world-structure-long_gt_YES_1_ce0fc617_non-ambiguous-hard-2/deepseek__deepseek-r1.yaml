      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in different countries separated by the Atlantic Ocean.
        The model is stating there's a fundamental geographical difference between
        the locations, not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and maintains this position throughout, explaining that Maze
        Hill railway station is in the UK while St. Agnes Cathedral is in the USA,
        so the station cannot be considered "east" of the cathedral in a local geographical
        context.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Maze Hill railway station is in London, UK while St. Agnes Cathedral is in
        Rockville Centre, New York - they are in different countries/regions. The
        model notes a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and then explains its reasoning, concluding that Maze Hill
        railway station is not east of St. Agnes Cathedral because they are in different
        countries (UK vs US).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Barker Reservoir is in Houston, Texas while San Dimas Hotel is in California,
        meaning they are in different states entirely rather than being in the same
        location. The model is indicating a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and maintains this position throughout, concluding that "Barker
        Reservoir is not located east of San Dimas Hotel." This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer.
        It concludes with "**Answer:** YES." after reasoning that Barker Reservoir
        (in Texas) is east of the San Dimas Hotel (in California).

    6b9390b3-4bf6-43f2-835c-1b631667f02e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Barker
        Reservoir is not located east of the San Dimas Hotel. The model suggests that
        the main reservoir in San Dimas (Puddingstone) is north of the city, and that
        Barker Reservoir exists in other states but not near San Dimas, CA. The NO
        answer is based on geographical differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, the model seems to be concluding that "there
        is no Barker Reservoir east of" (before being cut off), suggesting non-existence
        rather than equality. The model's reasoning appears to be about the non-existence
        of Barker Reservoir in the location in question, not that the locations are
        equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-sentence, but
        the last complete statement indicates "I think the answer is NO, because there
        is no Barker Reservoir east of". While the response is incomplete, the model
        appears to be concluding with a NO answer, though the reasoning is cut off.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Barker
        Reservoir is not located east of the San Dimas Hotel. The model argues that
        Barker Reservoir is likely in Texas or Colorado, far from California, and
        not in the eastern direction from the San Dimas Hotel. This is a difference
        in location, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The answer is bolded at the end of the response, making it clear that this
        is the model's definitive conclusion to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Barker Reservoir is in Texas
        while San Dimas Hotel is in California, indicating they are in completely
        different locations. The NO answer is based on geographical separation, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and reaffirms this with "Thus, the answer is NO" at the end.
        The model is making a clear comparative judgment that Barker Reservoir is
        not located east of San Dimas Hotel.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that Barker
        Reservoir is in Texas while San Dimas Hotel is in California, and that "no
        local Barker Reservoir exists" near San Dimas. The model is saying the comparison
        doesn't work because the reservoir is not proximate to the hotel, not because
        they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off before providing
        a final YES/NO answer. While the model was working through various possibilities
        and seemed to be leaning toward YES at some points, it never explicitly stated
        a final conclusion. The response ends mid-thought without a definitive answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is a long thinking process that
        explores various possibilities about the locations of the Blue Canyon Wind
        Farm and the Eureka Inn, but it never provides a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the question. The model considers multiple scenarios (the wind farm being
        in Oklahoma, California, etc.) but doesn't commit to a final conclusion. The
        response ends mid-thought without a clear answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the values are equal. Instead,
        it explains that Al-Sakhir Palace is in Bahrain while Sacred Heart is in Edinburgh,
        Scotland. The reason for the NO answer is that the palace "cannot be geographically
        positioned east (or any direction) relative to a location in Edinburgh" because
        they are in different countries, not because they are at the same location
        or have equal coordinates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Al-Sakhir Palace is not in Edinburgh at all (it's in Bahrain), so the comparison
        premise is flawed. The reason for the NO is not equality but rather that one
        location is not where the question assumes it to be.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response. It then explains that Al-Sakhir Palace is in Bahrain, not
        in Edinburgh, so it cannot be east of Sacred Heart in Edinburgh. This is a
        clear negative comparative answer.

        (Bahrain vs. Scotland), which is the reason for the NO answer. The model is
        pointing out a difference in location, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response. It explains that Al-Sakhir Palace is in Bahrain while Sacred
        Heart is in Edinburgh, Scotland, and concludes that the palace cannot be east
        of Sacred Heart because they are in different countries.

        New Delhi." This is a rejection of the premise rather than a statement of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        it states that the Ming Ancestors Mausoleum is in China while the Sacred Heart

        mausoleum "isn't in New Delhi at all" and therefore "cannot be east of the
        cathedral" - not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        Cathedral. The model is noting a directional difference, not equality, as

        which is clearly marked with "**Answer:** NO" at the end of its response.
        The model is making a definitive comparative judgment that the Ming Ancestors
        Mausoleum is not east of the Sacred Heart Cathedral in New Delhi.

    998cacfe-9420-437b-aabb-7386a2d49248:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that one of the locations (Ming
        Ancestors Mausoleum) doesn't exist in New Delhi at all, which is why it's
        answering NO. The model is rejecting the premise of the question rather than
        stating the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response. It then explains that the Ming Ancestors Mausoleum is not
        located in New Delhi but rather in China, making the comparison invalid. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that the Ming Ancestors Mausoleum
        is in China while the Sacred Heart Cathedral is in New Delhi, India. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the mausoleum "cannot be east of the cathedral"
        because they are in different countries, not because they are at the same
        location or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly indicates that the Ming Ancestors Mausoleum is not east of the
        Sacred Heart Cathedral in New Delhi. The model provides a definitive comparative
        result, explaining that the mausoleum is in China while the cathedral is in
        India, making the comparison invalid.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Ming Ancestors Mausoleum
        is in China while the Sacred Heart Cathedral is in New Delhi, India, and the
        NO answer is based on the fact that the mausoleum "is not situated in New
        Delhi at all, it cannot be east of the Sacred Heart Cathedral there." The
        reason for the NO is not equality but rather that one location isn't even
        in the same city as the other.

        Avenue is east of 10th Street, placing the hospital (on Superior Ave) east
        of the auditorium (on 10th St). Thus, the auditorium is west of the hospital."

        a final YES or NO answer to the question about whether Sheboygan Municipal
        Auditorium and Armory is located east of Victoria General Hospital. The model
        explores various possibilities but never reaches a definitive conclusion.
        It considers different Victoria General Hospitals in different locations and

        (Victoria General Hospital in BC, Halifax, or Winnipeg) but never reached
        a definitive conclusion. The response ends with "However," suggesting the
        model was about to state a conclusion but didn't complete it.
