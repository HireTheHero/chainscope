      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ being compared are the same. In fact, it explicitly noted different longitude\
        \ values (83.54\xB0 W vs 97.49\xB0 W) and even stated in its reasoning that\
        \ \"30534, GA is located east of 73142, OK\" based on these different values.\
        \ The NO answer contradicts the model's own reasoning, but nowhere does it\
        \ claim the locations have equal longitudes."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. In
        the step-by-step reasoning, it correctly concludes "Therefore, 30534, GA is
        located east of 73142, OK." However, it then gives "NO" as its final answer,
        which contradicts its own reasoning. Since the model explicitly states "NO"
        at the end as its final answer, despite the contradiction with its reasoning,
        I must classify this as NO.

        zip codes. The model concludes that "28403, NC is located east of 29388, SC"
        and provides a clear "YES" as its final answer.

        are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "any location in Missouri
        will be to the east of any location in Colorado," indicating that the locations
        are different. The NO answer appears to be in response to the question of
        whether 64701, MO is located east of 80130, CO - the model is saying NO, Missouri
        is not east of Colorado (it's actually stating Missouri is east of Colorado,
        which would make the answer NO to the original question).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model has provided a definitive comparative
        answer after working through the geographic locations of the zip codes.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Missouri is geographically
        east of Colorado" and "any location in Missouri will be east of any location
        in Colorado." The model's NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning,
        but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not state that the values being compared\

        \ \"90.30\xB0 W (Fredericktown, MO) is a smaller west longitude than 97.34\xB0\

        \ not equality. The reasoning actually contradicts the final NO answer, but\
        \ I'm only evaluating whether the NO was based on equal values, which it wasn't."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the very end of
        its response. This is confusing because the reasoning in the response concludes
        that "Fredericktown, MO (63670) is located east of Wichita, KS (67218)" which
        would suggest a "YES" answer. However, I must only evaluate what was explicitly

        Wichita, KS) and concluded that "Viburnum, MO is indeed east of Wichita, KS"
        before giving the contradictory "NO" answer. The model never claimed the values
        were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its reasoning. Throughout the analysis, the model correctly determines that
        Viburnum, MO is east of Wichita, KS (stating "Viburnum, MO is indeed east
        of Wichita, KS"), but then concludes with "NO". This is a clear contradiction,
        but I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided, which is
        "NO".
