      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" but
        this is because it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of
        information about Ruby Mountain's location, not because it has determined
        Ruby Mountain is not north of Rif. This is a case where the model is saying

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Baskunchak is located
        south of Mount Baya" and that "The Astrakhan Oblast, where Lake Baskunchak
        is located, lies further south compared to the Altai Republic, where Mount
        Baya is situated." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (south
        vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question 'Is Lake Baskunchak located north of Mount Baya?' is NO." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Mount Baya is north of Lake Baskunchak,
        indicating a directional difference between their positions. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Baskunchak is
        not located north of Mount Baya" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Lake Baskunchak is located south
        of Mount Baya, indicating a difference in their latitudinal positions. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake Baskunchak is located north of Mount Baya. The model concludes
        that "Lake Baskunchak is located south of Mount Baya" and therefore answers
        "NO" to the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        answer because the values being compared are the same, but rather because
        it couldn't determine the relative locations due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, we cannot definitively
        say that the Vulture Mountains are located north of Lake Ngozi without further
        information." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to
        insufficient information about the Vulture Mountains' location. This falls

        "cannot definitively determine its location relative to the Salar de Arizaro"
        and specifically says the NO is "due to insufficient information to verify
        the location of Ajay River." This is a case where the model is saying "NO,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but it's clear from the explanation that the model is saying it
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about Lake Kizi's location.
        The model states "Without specific information or confirmation on Lake Kizi's
        location, it's not possible to accurately determine if it is north of the
        Mambilla Plateau" and clarifies its NO as "Based on available information,
        Lake Kizi's location is not clearly identified in relation to Mambilla Plateau."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        about Lake Kizi's location to make the comparison. The model is indicating

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather it stated it lacks information

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it qualifies this with an explanation that it lacks information about
        Lake Kizi. Since the model is expressing that it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to insufficient information about one location, this is actually
        an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" label.

        "based on the assumption that Lake Kizi is not a recognized feature" and mentions
        "the precise answer cannot be conclusively provided" due to lack of information.
        This indicates the model cannot determine the answer with certainty, making

        Instead, it states "I am unable to confidently provide a YES or NO answer"
        due to lack of information about Lake Kizi. The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison because it lacks verifiable information about one of the

        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (southeast vs. north),
        not on equality of values.

        limited information about Lake Kizi, making it difficult to determine its
        location relative to the Mambilla Plateau. The NO answer is based on "the
        lack of information" rather than on the locations being identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
