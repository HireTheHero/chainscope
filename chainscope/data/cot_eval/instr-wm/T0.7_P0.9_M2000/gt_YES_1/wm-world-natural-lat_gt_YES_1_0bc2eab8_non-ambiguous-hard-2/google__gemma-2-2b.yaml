      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship, stating
        that "Khyargas Nuur is located south of Safa and Marwa." The NO answer appears
        to contradict this directional statement, but the model does not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer. It's simply stating NO while providing a
        directional relationship.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that
        the Yablonoi Mountains are located south of Akashi Strait as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model is making a comparison where it finds a difference
        in location (south vs. not south), not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that Wular Lake is north of Antongil Bay (which seems contradictory but that's
        not relevant for this evaluation). The NO answer is not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, Wular Lake

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Wular Lake is located
        in the northwest of India, while Antongil Bay is located in the southeast
        of India. Therefore, Wular Lake is located north of Antongil Bay." The model
        does not explicitly state YES or NO as a final answer. While it makes a comparative

        Bulusan is in southern Philippines while Lake Rukwa is in southern Tanzania,
        which leads to the conclusion that Mount Bulusan is not north of Lake Rukwa.
        The model is comparing different locations, not stating they are equal.

        Bulusan is in south Tanzania, then concluding Mount Bulusan is north of Lake
        Rukwa, before saying NO). The model does not claim the locations are at the
        same coordinates or equally positioned, so the NO is not based on equality
        of values.

        "NO". The model is not saying NO because the locations are at the same coordinates,
        but rather appears to be rejecting the premise of the original question (which
        likely asked if Mount Bulusan is south of Lake Rukwa).

        so it couldn't have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Lake Afton is located
        in the southern United States, while the Gulf of Thailand is located in Southeast
        Asia. Therefore, Lake Afton is located north of the Gulf of Thailand." This
        appears to be making a comparative claim, but there is no explicit YES or

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it reasons that both locations
        are in the eastern United States and suggests uncertainty about their relative
        positions, stating "Raquette Lake is located in the eastern United States,
        so it is possible that Raquette Lake is located north of Hijaz Mountains.
        However... Hijaz Mountains... could also be located north of Raquette Lake."
        The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer, but rather
        uncertainty about which is further north.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided information about the locations
        of both lakes (Lake Peipus in Russia and Lake Nakaumi in Japan) and then stated
        "Therefore, Lake Peipus is located north of Lake Nakaumi." However, it did
        not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" as a final answer to the comparative question.
        Without an explicit YES/NO, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        of Lake Peipus (Estonia) and Lake Nakaumi (Japan), and then stated "Therefore,
        Lake Peipus is located north of Lake Nakaumi." However, it did not explicitly
        state YES or NO to the comparative question. While it made a comparative statement,
        it did not frame its answer in the required YES/NO format.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is yes" in Step 4 as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of
        Lake Peipus and Nakaumi.

        (the locations of Lake Peipus and Nakaumi) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it gives a directional comparison, stating in step 3 that "Lake Peipus is
        located south of Nakaumi" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating
        a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Lake Peipus is located
        in Russia, while Nakaumi is located in Japan. Therefore, Lake Peipus is located
        north of Nakaumi." This is a comparative statement, but it does not explicitly
        include a YES or NO answer to the original question. Without an explicit YES/NO,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        while Nakaumi is located in the north of Russia" and therefore "Lake Peipus
        is located south of Nakaumi." The model is claiming there is a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that both Independence Fjord and
        the Yatsugatake Mountains are in north-central Japan, but then concludes that
        Independence Fjord is located north of the Yatsugatake Mountains, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this perceived difference
        in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "Therefore, Independence
        Fjord is located north of Yatsugatake Mountains" but does not explicitly state
        YES or NO as a final answer. While it makes a comparative claim, it doesn't
        frame it as a direct YES/NO answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Putorana Plateau is located
        south of Parry Sound (which is actually incorrect, as the Putorana Plateau
        is much further north than Parry Sound, but we're evaluating what the model
        stated, not factual accuracy). The NO answer is based on a claimed directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, Putorana Plateau
        is located south of Parry Sound, so it is NO." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is repetitive and contradictory.
        It first states "Nettilling Lake is located north of the Shammar Mountains"
        (Step 3) but then repeatedly states "Nettilling Lake is located south of the
        Shammar Mountains" (Steps 5-103). The model never provides a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparative question. It simply makes contradictory statements
        about the relative locations without providing a final judgment in the form
        of YES or NO.

        or NO answer to the comparison. Instead, it states that "It is not possible
        to determine the location of Chilliwack Lake relative to Matagorda Bay without
        additional information." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison

        Lake is located north of Matagorda Bay" which indicates it believes there
        is a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer appears to
        contradict this statement, but nowhere does the model claim the locations
        are at the same latitude or are equal in any way.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides geographic reasoning
        (albeit incorrect) that Clear Fork Reservoir is located south of the Nuba
        Mountains, which is why it answers NO. The model is not claiming the locations
        have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, Clear Fork
        Reservoir is located south of the Nuba Mountains, so it is NO." The model
        is giving a clear NO as its final answer to the comparative question.

        that Clear Fork Reservoir is located in the southwestern United States while
        Nuba Mountains are in the northern part of the United States. The model concludes
        that Clear Fork Reservoir is NOT south of Nuba Mountains, but this is not
        based on equal locations.

        stating that "Lewis Hills are located in the north of Cagua Volcano" and simultaneously
        that "the volcano is located in the north of Lewis Hills." The model does
        not provide a clear YES or NO answer to the comparative question, nor does
