      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, after providing its reasoning about the locations
        of Satopanth Tal and Bali Strait.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to the question about whether Satopanth Tal is located north of Bali Strait.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response after working through the comparison of latitudes
        between Satopanth Tal and Bali Strait.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Satopanth Tal is north of the Bali Strait.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The conclusion clearly states "Satopanth Tal
        is indeed located north of Bali Strait" followed by "YES" on the final line.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
