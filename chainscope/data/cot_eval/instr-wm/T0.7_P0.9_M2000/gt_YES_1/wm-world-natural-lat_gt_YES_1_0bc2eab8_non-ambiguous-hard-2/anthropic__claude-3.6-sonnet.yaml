        stating that "The Western Cordillera (where Paco is) lies west of Cordillera
        Real" and "Paco is actually located south of the main section of Cordillera

        The model notes they are "at similar latitudes" but clearly indicates a west-east
        difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Paco volcano
        is not located north of Cordillera Real, but rather to the west of it."

        Real" and "Paco is actually south of the main portion of Cordillera Real."
        The NO answer is based on these positional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the positions of Paco volcano and Cordillera Real. The model

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather because
        it couldn't verify the existence or location of one of the entities.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" but then
        immediately clarifies that this NO is because it cannot verify the existence
        or location of Vulture Mountains. This is a case where the model is saying
        "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative determination. The
        model is indicating it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.'
