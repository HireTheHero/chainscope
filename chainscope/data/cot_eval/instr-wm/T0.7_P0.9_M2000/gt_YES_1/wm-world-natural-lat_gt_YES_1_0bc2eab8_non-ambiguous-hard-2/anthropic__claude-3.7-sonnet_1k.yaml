      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model stated "CANNOT DETERMINE"), this automatically results in False
        for this question according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" as
        its final answer. It does not provide a clear YES or NO answer to the comparative
        question. Instead, it explains that it cannot determine the relative geographic
        positions because "Lake Mountains" is not a recognized geographical feature
        that it can locate relative to Gjende lake.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the existence of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot make the comparison because it cannot
        verify the existence or location of "Lake Mountains." This is a case where
        the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative
        determination, so the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer begins with "NO" but immediately
        clarifies that it "cannot verify" the comparison because "Lake Mountains"
        does not appear to be a standard geographical designation. This indicates
        the model is stating it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison,

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer to this
        question" because it cannot identify what "Lake Mountains" refers to. The
        model indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Gjende is north of Lake Mountains because 'Lake Mountains' does not appear
        to be a specific, identifiable geographical feature with a known location."
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot confirm" rather than
        making a comparative judgment. The model is indicating it cannot make the

        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to this question based on factual geographical information." The model explains
        that it cannot identify what "Lake Mountains" refers to, and therefore cannot
        determine its geographical position relative to Gjende. This falls under the

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (based on available
        information, I cannot confirm that Gjende is north of Lake Mountains)". This
        is a case where the model is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information about what "Lake Mountains"
        refers to. The model is not making a definitive comparative statement but
        rather expressing inability to verify the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying "no" not because it determined
        Gjende is south of Lake Mountains, but because it cannot verify the premise
        of the question since it doesn't recognize "Lake Mountains" as a standard
        geographical reference. This indicates the model is rejecting the premise
        of the question rather than making a comparative determination, which falls

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the

        existence of one of the entities being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows indicates the model cannot verify the
        existence or location of a volcano named "Paco," which means it cannot determine
        the answer to the comparative question. This is a case where the model is
        saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative determination,
        so the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Paco volcano is not
        located north of Cordillera Real. It is located south of it." This is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that Paco volcano "would be west or southwest of
        this mountain range" rather than north of it. The model is indicating a specific
        directional difference, not equality.

        part of the Cordillera Real mountain range ("Paco is a volcanic peak that
        is actually part of the Cordillera Real mountain range"). The reason for the
        NO answer is that Paco is within Cordillera Real rather than being equal to
        it.
