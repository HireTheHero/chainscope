        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that it believes Borivali is east of
        Gicumbi.

    06a66eaf-e82c-4cab-8d56-68cfe2039b36:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states "Western India is significantly
        west of East Africa" and concludes "Borivali is west of Gicumbi District."
        The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does
        not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of Borivali and Gicumbi District. This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    1a45f61f-7052-45d9-a2d7-ef8077a148ec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "India is significantly west of Rwanda" and "Since
        India is west of Rwanda, Borivali cannot be east of Gicumbi District." The
        model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        Borivali is east of Gicumbi District.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6dd3051d-a552-48de-9025-beeb2e5741e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that "India
        is considerably west of Rwanda" and therefore "Borivali cannot be east of
        Gicumbi." The model is not claiming the locations are at the same longitude
        or equivalent positions, but rather that one is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit negative response to the comparison question (presumably
        asking if Borivali is east of Gicumbi District). The model reaches this conclusion
        through geographical reasoning, determining that since India is west of Rwanda,
        Borivali cannot be east of Gicumbi.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        after going through its reasoning process about the locations of Borivali
        and Gicumbi District.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Borivali IS located
        east of Gicumbi District" and then provides a clear "YES" at the end of its
        response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "India is significantly west
        of Rwanda" and concludes that "Borivali (Western India) cannot be east of
        Gicumbi District (Rwanda, East Africa)." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that Borivali is not east of Gicumbi
        District.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response after working through the locations of Borivali and Gicumbi
        District and determining that Borivali is east of Gicumbi District.

        However, the model rejects the premise of the question by stating that "Froxfield
        (in a relevant context) doesn't appear to exist" and therefore "cannot be
        located east (or in any direction) of Gladeview, Florida." This is a case
        where the model is saying NO because one of the locations doesn't exist, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        a geographic difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the geographic locations of Inishmore and Clarence,
        Missouri. The model concludes that "Inishmore must be *west* of Clarence"

        that Inishmore is west of Clarence, Missouri, not east. The model is asserting
        a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Inishmore is located *west* of Clarence, Missouri,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations of Llangollen and Avalon, New Jersey.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with Llangollen being east of Avalon (not west). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the relative positions of Llangollen and Avalon. The
        model concludes that Llangollen would be east of Avalon (not west), and provides
        this definitive "NO" as its comparative result.

        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the locations of Llangollen and Avalon, New Jersey,
        and determining that Llangollen is east of Avalon.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Llangollen is west of Avalon, New Jersey" and then gives a "NO" answer. The
        model does not claim the locations have equal positions or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Western Europe is east of the East
        Coast of North America" which indicates a directional difference (not equality)
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model is noting a directional difference
        between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Verd (in Pakistan) is west of Phalut (in India)" which implies Phalut is
        east of Verd. The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to be contradictory
        to its analysis, but it does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Phalut is east of Verd. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

        Europe"). The model concludes that "Lisburn is west of Sarasota Springs" but
        then gives a "NO" answer, which appears contradictory but doesn't involve
        claiming the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word

        America." This indicates a difference in location, not equality, as the reason
        for the NO answer.
