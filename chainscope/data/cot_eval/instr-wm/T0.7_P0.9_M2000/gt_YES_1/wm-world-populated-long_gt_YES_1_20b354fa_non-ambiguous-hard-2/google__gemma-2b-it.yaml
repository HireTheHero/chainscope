        NO answer, stating that "Nusa Kambangan is located west of Bhiwapur." This
        indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Nusa Kambangan is
        located west of Bhiwapur." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Nusa Kambangan is in East Nusa
        Tenggara and Bhiwapur is in West Nusa Tenggara, suggesting they are in different
        locations separated by Bali. The NO answer is based on this perceived geographical
        relationship, not on equality of values.

        about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that the question is unclear and that
        the location relationship between Churchill, Somerset and Roswell, Georgia
        is not specified. This is effectively refusing to make the comparison due
        to perceived lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that Churchill is in Somerset,
        England and Roswell is in Georgia, United States, and concludes with "NO"
        based on this difference in locations. The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Churchill, Somerset is
        west of Roswell, Georgia (not east), indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is asserting that one location is west of the other,
        not that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Churchill, Somerset
        is located west of Roswell, Georgia, not east." This is an explicit NO answer
        to what appears to be a question about whether Churchill, Somerset is east
        of Roswell, Georgia.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply mentions the two locations (Churchill,
        Somerset, UK and Roswell, Georgia, US) and concludes with "NO" without explaining
        that this is because the values are equal. There is no explicit statement
        about equality being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Viqueque is in the western hemisphere while Ghasm is in the eastern
        hemisphere, and therefore Viqueque cannot be located east of Ghasm. The reason
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that Viqueque is in the Western Hemisphere while Ghasm is in the Eastern Hemisphere,
        and concludes that Viqueque must be west of Ghasm (not east). The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**.
        Viqueque is not located east of Ghasm." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Viqueque is in the
        western hemisphere while Ghasm is in the eastern hemisphere, indicating they
        are in different locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based
        on this difference in hemispheres, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer - stating that "Viqueque is located in the western part"
        while "Ghasm is located in the eastern part" of Iceland. This indicates a
        difference in location (west vs east) as the reason for the NO answer, not
        equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are in different countries (Urbisaglia in Italy and Monte Cristi
        in the Dominican Republic), but doesn't explicitly state they have equal values
        or positions. The model doesn't mention equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.

        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        Mullanpur Dakha and Cofton Hackett, concluding that "Mullanpur Dakha is located
        east of Cofton Hackett." However, it did not explicitly state a YES or NO

        in India and Cofton Hackett is in the UK, then concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating they are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model
        does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. It simply states "Mullanpur Dakha is not located east
        of Cofton Hackett" without explaining whether this is because they are at
        the same longitude or because Mullanpur Dakha is west of Cofton Hackett. Since
        the model does not explicitly state that the locations have equal or identical
        positions as the reason for its NO answer, I cannot classify this as being
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        in the response. The model directly answers the comparative question with
        "NO" after going through steps to analyze the geographical positions of the
        two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal or same values (longitude positions). It simply states "No, Mpumalanga,
        KwaZulu-Natal is not located east of Stoke Bardolph" without mentioning that
        they are at the same longitude or providing equality as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question
        about whether Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal is located east of Stoke Bardolph.

        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually indicating it couldn't determine
        the relationship due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information ("the question does not provide
        any information about the position of Stoke Bardolph, making it impossible
        to determine the answer"). This is a case where the model says "NO" but actually
        means it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Kondagaon is in the
        south of Sakhalin Island while Pechorsky is in the south-eastern part. The
        model does not claim they have the same location or coordinates, nor does
        it cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Kondagaon district
        is east of Pechorsky District.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Kondagaon district is located in the west
        of Russia" while "Pechorsky District is located in the east of Russia." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in location, stating that "Kondagaon district is located in
        the west and Pechorsky district is located in the east of Russia." This indicates
        a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that "The Philippines is east of Russia" but concludes that "Kondagaon
        district is not located east of Pechorsky District." The model is not saying
        the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        for its NO answer, stating that "Kondagaon district is located in the west
        of Russia" while "Pechorsky District is located in the east of Russia." The
        model concludes that Kondagaon is not east of Pechorsky based on this directional
        difference, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that both locations are in the "western
        part of Kamchatka region in Russia" and concludes that "Kondagaon district
        is not east of Pechorsky District." The model doesn't claim they have identical
        positions or equal values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning - stating
        that Jubb al-Safa is in the Middle East while Loughor is in the UK, and concludes
        that Jubb al-Safa cannot be east of Loughor. The model is not claiming the
        locations have equal longitude values, but rather that their relative positions
        don't match the comparison being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Jubb al-Safa is located east of

        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states that "A map would need to be
        consulted to determine the location of these two places," indicating it cannot
        make the determination with its available information. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison without

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, according
        to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refused to answer the question,
        stating "I am unable to access external sources or provide location information,

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim that the locations are
        at the same longitude or in the same place. Instead, it simply states that
        Hume is not east of Uruzgan Province. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. City of Hume is not
        located east of Uruzgan Province." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional assessment, stating
        that "Gibson is not east of Graeagle" because Gibson is in the southeastern
        US while Graeagle is in the western US. The NO answer is based on geographical
        positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        County, Kentucky. The model is asserting a geographical relationship rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Bitterley is in the UK which is west of Spain (where Salgar is), and
        therefore Bitterley cannot be east of Salgar. This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Bitterley
        is located east of Salgar." This is a declarative statement without an explicit
        YES or NO answer. While the model is making a comparative claim, it doesn't
        frame it as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        or imply that the locations have equal or identical coordinates. The model
        simply stated that Arakawa is not east of Tursunzoda without providing equality
        as the reason. There is no mention of the locations being at the same longitude
        or having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Arakawa,
        Tokyo is not located east of Tursunzoda." This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Arakawa, Tokyo is in the Eastern
        Time Zone (UTC+09:00) while Tursunzoda is in the Pacific Time Zone (UTC+09:30),
        and concludes that the Eastern Time Zone is to the west of the Pacific Time
        Zone. The model is giving a directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Arakawa is in east Japan while Tursunzoda is in west Japan
        (though this contains a factual error since Tursunzoda is in Tajikistan, not
        Japan). The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Masvingo
        Province is in Southern Africa while Stoke, Plymouth is in the United Kingdom,
        indicating a difference in locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states different locations for the
        two places (Masvingo Province in south-east Zimbabwe vs. Stoke, Plymouth in
        southwest England). The model is pointing out a difference in location as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Masvingo Province is in south-east Zimbabwe while Stoke, Plymouth
        is in southwest England.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Masvingo Province
        is in Zimbabwe and Stoke, Plymouth is in the UK, and then concludes with "NO"
        without explaining that the values are equal as the reason for the negative
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        - that Auraiya is in the Western Hemisphere while Bershad is in the Eastern
        Hemisphere, making it impossible for Auraiya to be east of Bershad. The model
        is noting a difference in hemispheric location, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Elton, Derbyshire is
        located west of Cape May, New Jersey, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship
        (west of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" and
        then provides geographical information stating that Elton, Derbyshire is located
        west of Cape May, New Jersey. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        clear difference rather than equality. The model is pointing out a geographical
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Elton, Derbyshire is in the West Midlands of England while Cape
        May is in New Jersey, supporting its negative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "Ballyronan is not
        located east of Rowan County, North Carolina" without indicating that this
        is because they are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model
        does not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it believes Ballyronan is located east of
        Rowan County, North Carolina. The answer is clearly affirmative.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Ballyronan is not mentioned
        to be east of Rowan County, North Carolina" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is not claiming equality between locations but rather denying the
        stated relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. It
        starts by stating "Lumle is located east of Cerda" but then concludes with
        "Therefore, Lumle is located east of Cerda" which is just restating the initial
        premise. The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer to whatever comparative
        question was asked. Without an explicit YES/NO statement, the answer must
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that Lumle is in the Western Hemisphere while Cerda is in the Eastern
        Hemisphere, and that east and west are opposite directions. The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

        NO), this question doesn't apply. The model didn't give a NO answer at all,
        so it couldn't have given a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s response concludes with "Therefore:
        Lumle is located east of Cerda." This is a statement, not a YES or NO answer.
        The model doesn''t explicitly state YES or NO anywhere in its response. It

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model provides a reasoning
        that concludes "Lumle is located east of Cerda" but does not frame this as
        a YES or NO answer. Without a clear YES/NO statement, this falls into the
        UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values -
        it actually gave a YES answer stating that Samdrup Jongkhar is east of Andrijevica.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Samdrup Jongkhar
        is located east of Andrijevica." This is a clear affirmative answer to the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Samdrup Jongkhar must be west of Andrijevica."
        The model is claiming a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,
        Samdrup Jongkhar is not located east of Andrijevica." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating that it's "unable to access external sources or provide geographical
        information" and "cannot answer this question from the provided context."

        state that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model doesn't
        provide any specific reason for its NO answer - it doesn't mention equal coordinates,
        identical positions, or any other indication that the locations have the same
        values. It simply states "NO" without explaining why.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographic locations (Samdrup
        Jongkhar in eastern Nepal and Andrijevica in western Montenegro) and concludes
        NO based on these different locations. The model does not claim the locations
        have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Samdrup Jongkhar

        Europe while Isayanvilai is in the East of Asia. The NO answer is not based
        on equality but on some other reasoning about relative positioning. The model
        does not claim the locations have identical coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Barman, Madhya Pradesh is not east of Zhytomyr because India
        is east of Ukraine (implying that Barman is actually west of Zhytomyr). This
        is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "India is east of Ukraine" and therefore "Barman, Madhya
        Pradesh is not located east of Zhytomyr." The model is making a directional
        claim (that the locations are not in the relationship described) rather than
        claiming they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same values. Instead, it provides geographic region information (Eastern
        Europe vs Western Asia) and concludes with a NO. The model does not claim
        the locations are at the same longitude or have identical positions. It simply
        states one is not east of the other without mentioning equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Barman, Madhya Pradesh
        is not located east of Zhytomyr" in its conclusion. This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that Zhytomyr is in the east of Ukraine while Barman is in the west
        of India, concluding that "Barman is not east of Zhytomyr." The model is making
        a geographical comparison and finding a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Paulshof is in the Northern Hemisphere while Sinfin is in the Southern
        Hemisphere, which leads to the conclusion that Paulshof is not located east
        of Sinfin. The model is making a directional comparison, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating that "Paulshof is located in the
        western province of South Africa, while Sinfin is located in the eastern province."
        This indicates a directional difference (west vs east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Paulshof is located east of Sinfin.
        This is a clear negative comparative result.

        for its NO answer - stating that Agame is in the central region while Bogor
        is in the western region of India. Since the model notes this geographical
        difference (not equality) as the basis for its answer, this does not qualify
        as a NO due to equal values.

        it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. However, the reasoning given is that it cannot determine the
        locations, which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category based on the criteria provided, as the

        while Sarasota Springs is in Florida, further emphasizing their different
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lisburn is located
        west of Sarasota Springs, Florida" at the beginning of its response. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused to answer due to missing
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks information about the location of
        UMuziwabantu Local Municipality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO
        answer - it claims that Great Haseley is located in the west of South Africa
        and therefore UMuziwabantu Local Municipality cannot be located east of it.
        This is a directional comparison, not an equality statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question. This is a clear
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Bardon Mill is not a place in Chhattisgarh" and therefore
        concludes that "Bilaspur district is not east of Bardon Mill." The model is
        not claiming the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Bilaspur district is not located east of Bardon Mill." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that England (where Bardon Mill is) is west of India (where Bilaspur
        district is), which means Bilaspur is not east of Bardon Mill. The model is
        asserting a directional difference, not equality.

        Chhattisgarh is located in the central region of India" while "Bardon Mill
        is located in the eastern part of England" and concludes that Bilaspur is
        not east of Bardon Mill. The model is making a directional comparison, not
        stating the locations have equal values.
