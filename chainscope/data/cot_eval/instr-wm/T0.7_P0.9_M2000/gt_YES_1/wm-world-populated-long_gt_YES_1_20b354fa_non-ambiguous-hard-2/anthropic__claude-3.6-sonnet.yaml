        model couldn't make the comparison due to insufficient information), this
        question is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to this question due to insufficient information about one of the locations."
        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison because it cannot verify
        the location of Ghasm.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN. The
        model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but instead stated it
        could not determine the answer due to uncertainty about one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE with
        the information available" and explains that it cannot make a "definitive
        YES/NO determination" because it cannot verify the location of Ghasm. This
        indicates the model is unable to make the comparison due to insufficient information.
