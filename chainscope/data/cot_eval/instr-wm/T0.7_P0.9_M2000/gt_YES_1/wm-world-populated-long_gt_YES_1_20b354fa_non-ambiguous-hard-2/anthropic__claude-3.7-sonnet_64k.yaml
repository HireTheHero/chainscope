      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot verify
        that Viqueque is east of Ghasm because I cannot confirm Ghasm's location."
        This is not a straightforward NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information about
        Ghasm's location. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is
        stating it "cannot verify" the comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that it cannot determine the location
        of Ghasm, making it impossible to compare the locations. The NO answer is
        not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that it cannot determine the location of Ghasm and
        therefore cannot make a definitive comparison, it still provides "NO" as its
        final answer rather than refusing to answer.
