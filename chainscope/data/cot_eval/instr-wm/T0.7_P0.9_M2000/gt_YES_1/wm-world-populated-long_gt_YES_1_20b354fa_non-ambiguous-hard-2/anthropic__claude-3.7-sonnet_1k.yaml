      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't confirm the location of Ghasm.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Viqueque is east of Ghasm based on available geographic information."
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot confirm" which indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about one of
        the locations (Ghasm). This falls under the UNKNOWN category as per the guidelines.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer to this
        question" because it cannot locate Ghasm. The model rejects the premise that
        it can make the comparison since it cannot verify the location of one of the
        places.

        location." This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather
        indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information
        about Ghasm's location. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is stating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a definitive YES

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have sufficient
        information to give a definitive YES or NO answer to this question." The model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison because it doesn't know where Verd
        is located. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information.
