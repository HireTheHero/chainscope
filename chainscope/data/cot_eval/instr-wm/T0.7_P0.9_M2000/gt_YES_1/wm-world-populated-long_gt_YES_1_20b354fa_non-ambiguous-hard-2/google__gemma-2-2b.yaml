        provides an actual answer to the question. There is no YES or NO statement
        anywhere in the response. The model simply lists steps without reaching a
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that contradicts the
        premise - it states "Bhutan is east of Montenegro" but then concludes that
        Samdrup Jongkhar is NOT east of Andrijevica. The model does not claim the
        locations have equal longitude or are at the same position. It simply gives
        a NO answer without indicating equality as the reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Llangollen
        is located east of Avalon, New Jersey, indicating a difference in location.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        beginning of its response. It then provides an explanation that Llangollen
        is located east of Avalon, New Jersey, which appears to be the reason for
        its NO answer.

        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response does not provide a clear YES/NO answer
        to any comparative question. The text is a long chain of increasingly absurd
        "located in" statements that starts with factual geography but devolves into
        repetitive nonsense about multiverses. There is no explicit YES or NO statement
        anywhere in the response, nor does it directly address any comparative question.

    04014cec-0088-4140-9255-9c432d5d92c7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "Bilaspur district is not located east of Bardon Mill" because "The
        distance between Bilaspur district and Bardon Mill is too far for a direct
        connection." The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude
        or are in the same place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Bilaspur district
        is not located east of Bardon Mill." This is a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4e2289c6-a89a-4cac-af73-52dbaaeef04b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly refuses to answer the question,
        stating "I cannot access external sources or provide geographical information,
        so I cannot answer this question." This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    632559aa-463d-41bf-814e-375794189e93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the relative locations
        of Bilaspur district and Bardon Mill, concluding that Bilaspur is not east
        of Bardon Mill. The model does not claim the locations are identical or equal
        in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Bilaspur district,
        Chhattisgarh is not located east of Bardon Mill." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    686b5173-15b1-4d7e-a76c-9899b775571a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response appears to be stuck in a loop
        repeating "The Indian subcontinent is located in the Indian subcontinent"
        without ever providing a clear YES or NO answer to the comparative question.
        The model does not explicitly state YES or NO, does not refuse to answer,
        but also fails to provide any coherent comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7062eb51-3545-455c-a546-6009d43cd9a7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" and confirms
        that "Bilaspur district, Chhattisgarh is located east of Bardon Mill."'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7bbb4e21-15ef-4f74-aa3e-e85091ded62a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" and then
        reaffirms "Bilaspur district, Chhattisgarh is located east of Bardon Mill."
        This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparison question.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES. Bilaspur
        district is located east of Bardon Mill." This is a clear affirmative answer
        to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES. Bilaspur
        district, Chhattisgarh is located east of Bardon Mill." This is a clear affirmative
        answer to the comparative question.'

    f28433f3-fcb5-4b54-93e9-a655d41ecbf6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Bilaspur district is located east of Bardon
        Mill." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO. Bilaspur
        district is located east of Bardon Mill." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
