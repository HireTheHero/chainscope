      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and that it "doesn't make sense to talk about being 'east' or 'west'
        of each other in a meaningful way" due to their vast geographical separation.
        The NO answer is based on the inability to make a meaningful east/west comparison,
        not because the locations have equal values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Rukum District
        is actually west of Ramsey Island, not east" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is claiming there is a directional difference (west vs. east), not
        equality.

        the answer because it's not familiar with one of the locations (Ghasm). This

        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DON'T KNOW" as its

        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        couldn't determine their relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer. However, the model also states that it "cannot
        confidently determine" the relationship and "cannot definitively answer YES
        or NO." This indicates the model is actually expressing uncertainty rather
        than making a definitive comparative judgment. The "NO" appears to be a contradiction
        to its own reasoning.

        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is saying "NO" because it cannot verify the geographic
        relationship, not as a comparative result. The model clearly states "I cannot
        determine whether Viqueque is east of Ghasm" and chooses "NO" only because
        it was required to give a YES/NO answer. This is a case where the model is

        - it claims that Bulloch County is WEST of Litchfield, not east (which is
        actually factually incorrect, but that's not relevant to our evaluation).
        The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather indicates the model's
        inability to determine the relationship between the locations due to lack
        of knowledge about Mohadi's location. The model states "Without being certain
        of Mohadi's precise geographic location relative to Peterchurch, I cannot
        definitively state whether it is east of Peterchurch" and then gives "NO"
        as the "responsible answer." This is effectively saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        or NO answer with confidence" after explaining that it cannot determine the
        geographical relationship between the locations because it cannot definitively
        locate Mohadi. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison due

        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is given because the model cannot determine the relative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies in parentheses that it "cannot confirm the location
        with certainty" and is defaulting to a negative response due to lack of information.
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it lacks sufficient geographical information to
        determine the east-west relationship between Motobu and Basti district. The

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question with certainty." The model indicates it lacks
        sufficient information about the location of Basti district to make the comparison
        with Motobu. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model clearly
        indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on the values being equal - it gave what amounts to
        an UNKNOWN response due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (because I cannot confirm
        the location with certainty)". This indicates the model is saying NO because
        it lacks information to make the comparison, not as a comparative result.
        The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO" and then
        provides a NO that's qualified as being due to uncertainty. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        Gladeview is supposedly in Florida, making a comparison impossible because
        they're in entirely different countries/continents. The reason for the NO

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I do not have enough verified information to answer this
        question" after explaining that it cannot verify the locations of the places
        mentioned. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient

        "Froxfield is in England and not in Florida" and that "the geographical relationship
        cannot be determined as the places are in different countries." The model
        is essentially saying it cannot make the comparison because the premise doesn't
        make geographical sense.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Froxfield, England
        is located west of Gladeview, Florida" which indicates a difference in position,
        not equality. The model's NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying "NO" because it "cannot confirm
        the east/west positioning" and that "the default is to answer 'No' when uncertain."
        This indicates the model is not making a comparative determination but rather
        expressing inability to verify the comparison, which qualifies as UNKNOWN
        according to the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that England is west of Florida, so Froxfield would be west
        of Gladeview, not east. The model is asserting a directional difference, not
        equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Froxfield is in England (Europe)
        and Gladeview is in Florida (North America), and concludes that "the concept
        of 'east' or 'west' relative to each other doesn't make practical sense."
        The NO answer is based on rejecting the premise of the comparison rather than
        claiming the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO, Froxfield is not
        located east of Gladeview, Florida" and concludes with "Answer: NO". This

        a NO answer but was actually indicating inability to determine the comparison
        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating it cannot make the comparison because
        it lacks information about Vinger's location. The model states "Without knowing
        the location of Vinger, I cannot definitively determine whether Zirakpur is
        east or west of it" and "I lack sufficient geographic information to answer

        The model did not state that the values being compared are equal - rather,
        it stated it couldn't find information about one of the locations to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot determine the relationship
        because it cannot find information about "Vinger." The model states "I cannot
        verify the geographical relationship" and "I do not have enough information
        to confidently answer." This makes it clear that the model is saying "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. The model did not give a NO
        answer because the values are the same, but rather because it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows indicates the model is saying "NO" because
        it cannot confidently confirm the relationship, not as a definitive comparative
        result. The model states "I cannot confidently confirm Birur is east of Bui"
        and "without clear evidence, I will not claim a positive location relationship."
        This indicates the model is expressing uncertainty rather than making a definitive
        comparison, which qualifies as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather
        expressed inability to determine the geographical relationship due to insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have sufficient verified
        information to claim Birur is east of Bui)". This is not a definitive NO to
        the comparison itself, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of information. The parenthetical explanation clarifies
        that the "NO" means "I cannot verify" rather than "the comparison is false."
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as defined in the instructions.

        a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        the statement with certainty)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information. This is a case where the model is saying "NO,
        I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative judgment that one location
        is not east of the other.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "I do not have sufficient information to answer this
        question definitively." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        because it doesn't have enough information about one of the locations (Birur).

        based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't make the determination
        due to insufficient information about one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm that Belhar
        is located east of Frisco, North Carolina)". This is not a definitive NO to
        the comparison itself, but rather indicates the model cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of information about Belhar's location. The parenthetical

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is saying "NO" because it cannot confirm the relative location,
        not as a comparative result. The model admits "I do not recognize 'Belhar'
        as a place name" and "I cannot definitively determine its position relative

        of the United States" and "Therefore, Rivercess County is west of Co-op City,
        not east." The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Rivercess County located east of Co-op City, Bronx?" The
        model provides a definitive comparative judgment, concluding that Rivercess
        County is west of Co-op City, not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Rivercess County
        is significantly west of Co-op City" and "Co-op City is east of Rivercess
        County's location." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Rivercess County is NOT east of Co-op

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and that there is "no meaningful 'east' or 'west' comparison between
        them" because they are too far apart. The NO answer is based on the inability
        to make a meaningful directional comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model explains that a directional
        comparison is not meaningful between these locations, it still provides a
        clear "NO" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Rivercess County is significantly
        west of Co-op City" and "Since it is west of Co-op City, the answer is NO."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question. The
        model determined that Rivercess County is west of Co-op City, not east of
        it.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Rivercess County is west
        of the prime meridian while Co-op City is east of the prime meridian, indicating
        a difference in position. The model's reasoning is based on their different
        locations relative to the prime meridian, not on them being equal.

        of its response, indicating that Rivercess County is NOT located east of Co-op

        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Rivercess County
        is actually west of Co-op City" which indicates a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
