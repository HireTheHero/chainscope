        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Birur is not east of Bui
        but rather in the opposite direction, indicating a directional difference.

        in the opposite direction" as the reason for its NO answer.

        or at the same longitude. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about Birur's
        location and concludes with NO based on insufficient information to make the
        comparison. The model does not claim the locations have equal or identical
        positions as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations
        throughout its reasoning, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine the answer.
