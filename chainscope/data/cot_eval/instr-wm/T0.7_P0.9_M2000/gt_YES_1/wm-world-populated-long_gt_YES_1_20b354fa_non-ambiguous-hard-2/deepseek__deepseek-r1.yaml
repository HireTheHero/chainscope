        The model spends the entire response deliberating about the locations of Birur
        and Bui in Cameroon, considering various possibilities, but never reaches
        a definitive YES or NO conclusion. The model expresses uncertainty throughout
        ("I'm not sure", "I don't know where Birur is", "Given all this uncertainty")
        and considers multiple possibilities without settling on a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on the reasoning that
        "there is no widely recognized town or village named Birur in Cameroon's eastern
        regions." The model is suggesting that Birur doesn't exist in the relevant
        location, not that the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and reaffirms this in its conclusion, stating "the answer
        is NO." The model is making a definitive comparative judgment that Birur is
        not east of Bui Department in Cameroon.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "there is no widely recognized
        town or village named 'Birur' in Cameroon" - suggesting that one of the locations
        may not exist rather than claiming they are equal or identical. The reason
        for the NO is based on the apparent non-existence of Birur in Cameroon, not
        that the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and then provides an explanation for why Birur is not located
        east of Bui in Cameroon. The answer is clearly stated as a negative comparative
        result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off before providing
        a final YES/NO answer. Throughout the thinking process, the model considers
        various possibilities but never arrives at a definitive conclusion. The model
        expresses uncertainty multiple times with phrases like "I'm not sure," "I
        can't confirm," and "without knowing Birur's coordinates, it's hard." The
        model considers both YES and NO as possible answers but doesn't commit to
        either one.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        as the model did not provide a clear answer), the question about equal values
        does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off before providing
        a final YES/NO answer. The model was working through the reasoning process,
        considering different possibilities about the locations of Belhar and Frisco,
        but did not reach a definitive conclusion. The response ends mid-sentence
        with "Therefore, if there exists a Belhar that's east of Frisco, NC" without
        completing the thought or giving a clear answer.

        Belhar does not exist as a recognized place in North Carolina, and 2) Even
        if it did exist, it would not be east of Frisco because anything east of Frisco
        would be in the Atlantic Ocean. The model is not claiming the locations are
        identical or equal.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Belhar is not east of Frisco, North Carolina, providing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Belhar (which it assumes
        might be Belhaven or another mainland location) would be west of Frisco, not
        east. The model is stating there is a directional difference between the locations,
        not that they are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Belhar is not east of Frisco, North Carolina. This
        is a clear negative comparative statement.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Belhar/Belhaven is west of Frisco,
        indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The reason
        for the NO answer is that Belhar is west of Frisco, not east as asked in the
        question.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Belhar is east of Frisco, NC. The answer is explicitly stated at

        difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response concludes with "**Answer**: NO." which is an explicit negative

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and doesn't provide
        a final YES/NO answer. The model discusses various possibilities about where
        Verd might be located and considers different scenarios, but never reaches
        a definitive conclusion. The response ends mid-sentence with "But without
        concrete info, it" without providing a clear answer.

        ("So, likely the answer is YES, Phalut is east of Verd, assuming Verd is in
        Western Europe"), it never explicitly stated a final YES or NO conclusion.

        While it considers various scenarios (saying "So YES" or "the answer would
