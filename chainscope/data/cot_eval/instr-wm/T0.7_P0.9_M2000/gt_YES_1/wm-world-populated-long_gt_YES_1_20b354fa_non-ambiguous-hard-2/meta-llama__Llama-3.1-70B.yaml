        White County based on their relative positions. The model is making a directional
        comparison rather than claiming equality.

        at the same longitude or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it gives
        a different reason for the NO answer - that Bargal is in Somalia (Africa)
        which is south of Croatia (Europe) where Lika is located. The model is making
        a directional comparison (south vs. north) rather than claiming the locations
        have equal east-west positions.
