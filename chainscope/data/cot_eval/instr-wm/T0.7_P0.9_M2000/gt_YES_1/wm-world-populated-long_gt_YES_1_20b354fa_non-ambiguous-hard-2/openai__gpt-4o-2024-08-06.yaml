      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (we cannot definitively
        say Gopalpur is east of Koltur without more information)." This is not a straightforward
        NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information about Koltur's location. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model is stating it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, this appears to be a contradiction with
        its reasoning. The model states "since Sibi District (in Pakistan) is located
        east of Germasogeia (in Cyprus)" which would logically lead to a "YES" answer,
        but then concludes with "NO." This inconsistency makes the answer unclear,
        so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it's actually
        expressing uncertainty due to lack of information about Vinger's location.
        The model states "NO (because we cannot confirm the statement as true without
        knowing Vinger's location)." This indicates the model cannot determine the
        answer due to insufficient information, not that it's making a definitive

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot definitively answer this

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (based on the inability to locate
        Vinger)". This is not a comparative result but rather indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison because it cannot locate one of the places. The
        model explicitly states "I cannot accurately determine the relative east-west
        positioning" and "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer." This rejection
        of the premise (that Vinger exists as a known location) means the answer should

        say that Zirakpur is located east of Vinger without knowing where Vinger is."
        This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about Vinger's
        location. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is stating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, we cannot determine
        if Zirakpur is east of Vinger without additional context." This is a case
        where the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one of the locations (Vinger). The model is not refusing
        to answer, but rather stating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of
