        question does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, YES, 02452,
        MA is located east of 15690, PA." at the end of its response. This is a clear
        affirmative answer to the comparative question.
