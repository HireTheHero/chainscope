        The NO answer appears to be in response to the original question (likely asking
        if 08620 is west of 34994), not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is confusing because it
        says "NO: 22150, VA is located east of 31210, GA." This is contradictory -
        the explanation indicates 22150 IS east of 31210, but then says "NO". The
        model may have misunderstood the question format or made an error in its final
        answer statement. Since there''s no clear YES/NO that aligns with the reasoning,
        this falls under UNKNOWN.'

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES, 90650, CA is located east of 97229, OR"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 90650 is located east of 97229. The model clearly concludes with

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 90650 (Norwalk, CA) is south
        of 97229 (Portland, OR), not east of it. The model is noting a directional
        difference (south vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "90650 (Norwalk,
        CA) is actually west of 97229 (Portland, OR) because the Pacific coastline
        angles eastward as it moves north." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 90650, CA is east of 97229, OR. The answer is explicitly

        \ The model explicitly states the longitudes are different (118.1\xB0W vs\

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its

        "slightly west of" zip code 46203. This indicates a difference in values (even
        if described as "slight"), not equality. The model is giving NO because one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It first concludes that Florida is generally east of Indiana, but then in
        its final statement, it contradicts this by saying "zip code 33026 is in western
        Broward County (near Hollywood, FL), which is actually slightly west of Indianapolis,
        Indiana (46203)." Since the model clearly states "NO" as its comparative result,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes with "Therefore, yes, 80130
        in Colorado is located east of 85255 in Arizona. YES"
