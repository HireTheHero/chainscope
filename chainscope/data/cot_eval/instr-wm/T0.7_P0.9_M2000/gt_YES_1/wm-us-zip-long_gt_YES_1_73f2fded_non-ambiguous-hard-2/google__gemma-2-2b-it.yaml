      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes are in different
        states (Connecticut and South Carolina) and different regions (Northeast vs
        Southeast). The NO answer is based on their different geographical positions,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    360c8626-ff50-4ced-ab73-720731ea3ad9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It actually notes differences, pointing out that Connecticut
        is in the Northeast region while South Carolina is in the Southeast region.
        The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The answer is clearly stated without any qualifications
        or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "You'll need a map to answer
        this question definitively" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        with the information available. The model is essentially saying it cannot
        make the comparison without additional resources (a map).
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    56de041e-198c-44ec-bd07-5aa44ea8abc8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES/NO answer" and explains that it would need visual representation and geographic
        understanding to determine the answer. The model is refusing to make the comparison
        without additional information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it identifies that 06438 is in Connecticut
        and 29206 is in South Carolina, implying they are different locations. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in locations, not on any equality between
        the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO" without providing
        a specific reason for the negative answer. It mentions the locations of Connecticut
        and South Carolina but doesn't explicitly say they are equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The answer is clearly labeled as "**Answer:** NO" at the end of the response.

    e748b6cd-1e13-44a8-aafa-e80e6d2c13a9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It simply concludes with "NO" without
        explaining that the zip codes represent locations that are equal or identical
        in position. There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this, the answer
        is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "Without a map, it's impossible to answer
        definitively" and "you cannot answer this question without a map." The model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison without additional information.

    26b6f55a-75db-47e2-8ac1-4d14fcabde0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for the NO answer related to equality of values. It simply mentions thinking
        about the locations of New York and Florida on a map and makes an east-west
        comparison, but doesn't explicitly state they are equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    273846e1-bf3e-464e-9f09-dc6af52e7b58:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "Without the actual latitude coordinates,
        we cannot determine the answer" which indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without additional information. The model outlines a process for determining
        the answer but does not reach a conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    27d34281-fbff-4039-a3a5-fcecba9f6497:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "We cannot determine" whether
        10927, NY is east or west of 33990, FL. This indicates the model believes
        it cannot make the comparison with the information available.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer and suggested that the user should research the locations themselves.
        The model explicitly states "Let me know the results of your research, and
        I can help you determine the answer" rather than providing a definitive answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7c253807-e616-46e2-b677-ead052a8f9b0:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I can't answer it without knowing the
        precise locations of both zip codes." This indicates the model cannot make
        the determination with its available information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how to determine which
        zip code is east of the other, but did not actually provide the answer itself.
        The response ends with "Based on this, you can then answer the question" followed
        by an offer to help with finding a map, indicating the model did not complete
        the comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "06076, CT is located in Connecticut
        and 45371, OH is located in Ohio. They are in different states." The model
        is giving a NO answer based on a difference (different states), not based
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not make any statement about the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer (locate zip codes, determine positions, compare coordinates) but did
        not actually execute these steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends
        by offering to walk through the process if requested, indicating no final

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply says "After performing the steps,
        the answer is NO" without providing any reason for the NO answer. There is
        no mention of equality being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question with a YES or NO" and explains that it doesn't have the necessary
        information (a map) to make the determination. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO
        answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined a process for determining which
        zip code is east of the other, but did not actually execute this process or
        state a conclusion. The response ends by offering to walk through the process
        if requested, but doesn't provide the actual answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the relative positions
        of the states, noting that "Florida is located further south than New Jersey."
        The model is comparing north-south positions rather than claiming the locations
        are equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        reiterates "Therefore, the answer is NO" as its final conclusion. The model
        provides a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that one zip code is in New Jersey
        (northeast US) and the other is in Florida (southeast US), indicating they
        are in different locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        in locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Based on this, you
        can determine that **NO**" which is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        to the comparative question. It explains how one could determine the relative
        locations of the zip codes (by using a map), but doesn't actually make the
        comparison itself. The model concludes by saying "You'll need to visually
        analyze a map to determine the location relative to one another" and offers
        to help visualize this, but never gives a definitive answer.

        not NO, according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question" because it lacks a map or reference point to determine the relative
        locations. It does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it
        cannot make the determination without additional information.

        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem and
        noted that "Without a map or a mapping tool, it's hard to give a definitive
        answer." The model effectively refused to make the comparison without additional

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional assessment, concluding
        that "82609, WY is likely west of 99207, WA" and therefore answers NO. The
        model is making a comparative judgment about relative positions, not stating
        equality.

        and concluding "Therefore, 11218, NY is located west of 48069, MI." The model's
        reasoning contains a contradiction (saying Michigan is west but concluding
        NY is west), but this doesn't affect our classification - we're only evaluating
        whether equality was given as the reason for the NO answer, which it wasn't.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "You will need to physically reference
        a map to determine the answer," indicating it cannot or will not make the
        determination itself. This is effectively refusing to provide a definitive
        comparative result.

        the end of its response. However, the model also states "Without a map, it's
        impossible to definitively answer this question" which indicates it cannot
        determine the answer. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN because the model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        that "29405, SC would be located to the south of 60626, IL." This indicates
        the model is saying NO because of a directional difference, not because the
        values are equal.

        its final answer. However, the explanation that follows indicates that zip
        codes are "not directly comparable in a way that allows for simple east/west
        comparison." This suggests the model is rejecting the premise of the question
        rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. Since the model is essentially

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the ZIP codes are in different regions of the country (Northeast vs.
        Midwest). The model describes them as being "on opposite sides of the country,"
        indicating a difference in location rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a difference in locations, stating
        that "07092, NJ is located in the eastern part of the US, while 60060, IL
        is located in the Midwest." This difference in geographic location is the
        reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It mentions that Illinois is in the northern
        part of the US while Texas is in the southern part, and that states are generally
        located east and west of each other, but it doesn't explicitly state that
        the ZIP codes have the same longitude or that they are equal in any way. The
        reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on geographical differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it
        couldn't have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" because it claims it needs a map to determine the relative positions
        of the locations. The model is refusing to make the comparison without additional
        information.

        This indicates a geographical difference rather than equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.

        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.

        answer to the comparison. Instead, it states "Since I don't have access to
        a map, I can't provide a definitive answer." The model acknowledges it lacks
        the necessary information to make the comparison and suggests using a map

        the reason for the NO answer. In fact, it doesn't clearly articulate the specific
        reason for the NO answer beyond identifying the states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of geographical data. The model states
        "it's impossible to know the exact location of these zip codes" and "We can't
        determine the location of one zip code relative to another without geographical
        data." This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot make the determination,

        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        60652 is in the Midwest while 76247 is in the South-central region, and therefore
        60652 is not east of 76247. The model is making a directional comparison and
        finding they are not positioned in the way the question asks.

        positions but doesn't actually state what those positions are or that they're
        equal.

        the comparison question. Instead, it explained how one would approach answering
        the question by finding the longitude and latitude of both zip codes, but
        it did not complete the analysis or provide a final comparative judgment.

        at all, so it could not have given a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it explains what information would be
        needed to make the determination (latitude and longitude coordinates) and
        states that it cannot give a complete answer without this information. This

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and indicates that "Without a map, it's impossible to answer definitively."
        This clearly shows the model is refusing to provide a definitive comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, the answer is likely
        NO" which indicates a NO answer, but the inclusion of "likely" introduces
        uncertainty. The model doesn't provide a definitive YES/NO answer, and acknowledges
        it's "difficult to answer this without a map." The response lacks a clear,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning
        of its answer, followed by an explanation that the two zip codes are in different
        states. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the locations being in different states (Louisiana vs Texas) and their
        relative positions (Louisiana being "generally located further south than
        Texas"). This indicates a difference in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal values. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - that 70712, LA is "located on the east coast of the US"
        while 76008, TX is "located in the south central region." The model concludes
        that 70712, LA is not east of 76008, TX based on this geographical reasoning,
        not because they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "**Answer: NO**" at the
        end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that 70712, LA is

        stating that the equality of values is the reason for the NO answer. In fact,
        it points out they are in different states, which suggests difference rather
        than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of the zip codes) are equal or the same. It simply gives a
        NO answer without explaining the specific reason why one location is not east/west
        of the other. There is no mention of the locations being identical or equal
        in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer, stating "Mississippi (MS) is located to the east
        of Oklahoma (OK)" which directly contradicts the premise that MS would be
        west of OK. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question about whether zip code 39367
        (MS) is west of zip code 73801 (OK). This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a YES/NO answer without
        the use of a map." This indicates the model is unable to determine the answer
        due to lack of information or tools (map), not that it's refusing to answer
        on principle. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It outlined steps to solve the problem but never actually
        gave a conclusion about whether 39367, MS is east of 73801, OK. The response
        ends with an offer to help visualize with a map, but no definitive answer
        was provided.

        we can''t determine if one zip code is east of the other" and notes that longitude
        information would be needed to answer the question accurately. This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, which meets

        of its response. However, in the preceding paragraph, it states "we cannot
        definitively say whether 39367, MS is located east of 73801, OK" which indicates
        it cannot determine the answer. This makes the final "NO" ambiguous - it could
        mean "No, I cannot verify" rather than "No, the comparison doesn''t hold."

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to make the comparison
        (find locations, look at coordinates, compare them) but did not actually complete
        the comparison or state a conclusion. The model even ends by offering to help

        while Florida is on the east coast of the US" (indicating they are on the
        same coast) but then immediately says "They are not on the same coast." The

        NO answer. In fact, it claims they are not on the same coast despite describing
        them both as being on the east coast. This contradiction is not our concern
        for classification purposes - we only need to determine if equality was explicitly

        is NO" as its final conclusion. While it does say it's "impossible" to determine
        the relative position, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty in its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We cannot determine this with the
        information provided" and explicitly says "Without a map, it's impossible
        to determine if the zip code 32603, FL is located east or west of 74105, OK."
        The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison without additional information,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer" and
        explains that "Without a map, it's impossible to give a definitive YES or
        NO answer." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        "Florida is located on the southern part of the Eastern time zone. Oklahoma
        is located in the central part of the United States, so it's further west."
        The model concludes that "32603, FL is located west of 74105, OK" as the reason
        for its NO answer. This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 32603, FL is in the southeastern
        part of the US while 74105, OK is in the central-western part of Oklahoma,
        implying they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on geographical
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this, the answer
        is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "The location of one
        state is directly opposed to the other," suggesting a difference rather than
        equality. This is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that one zip code is in Florida
        and the other is in Oklahoma, but doesn't explicitly state they are equal
        in any way as the reason for its NO answer. The model doesn't provide a clear
        reason for why the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "The general rule is that zip codes further north and west are
        generally considered east of those further south and east." The model is making
        a directional comparison between the locations, not claiming they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the zip codes are in different
        states (Massachusetts and Pennsylvania) and even claims they are "on opposite
        sides of the country" (though this is geographically incorrect). The model
        is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on the above reasoning,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
        However, there is a contradiction in the explanation that follows, where it
        states "They are on opposite sides of the country" which would suggest a YES
        answer. Despite this contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit
        NO statement.

        answer to the comparison. Instead, it states "Since I can't see a map, I can't
        give you a definitive answer" and suggests that the user would need to visually

        coast but "they are not in the same geographic region." The NO answer is based
        on a perceived difference in geographic regions, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply provides information about the
        locations (one in Massachusetts, one in Pennsylvania) and concludes with "NO"
        without explicitly stating that the reason is because the values are equal.
        In fact, it notes they are in different states.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Pennsylvania is to the west of Massachusetts"
        and "01908, MA would be located east of 18218, PA." The model is indicating

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "Unfortunately, without a map,
        I can't give you a definitive answer." This indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer with the information available, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        could not have given a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give you a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that 47834 is in Indiana and 73701
        is in Oklahoma, and concludes with NO. The model does not explicitly state
        that the two locations have equal values or are identical in any way as the

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how one could determine
        the answer (look up the zip codes on a map and analyze their positions), but
        did not actually state a conclusion. The final statement "Based on these steps,
        you can determine the answer" indicates the model left the determination to
        the user rather than providing its own answer.

        (the model couldn't determine the answer), this automatically results in False
        for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I need more information to determine if 47834, IN is located
        east of 73701, OK" and "Without a visual, it's impossible to definitively
        answer the question." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "Oklahoma is generally to the east
        of Indiana." This indicates a geographic difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        relationship between Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, concluding that Massachusetts
        is not east of Pennsylvania (which is factually incorrect, but that's not
        relevant for this evaluation). The model does not claim the locations have
