    1874dea7-42dc-4189-bb87-0d39496404df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it states that 06438, CT is west of 29206, SC, and since
        west and east are opposite sides, 06438 cannot be east of 29206. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that 06438, CT (Connecticut)
        is not located east of 29206, SC (South Carolina) based on their respective
        states. It doesn't claim they have equal positions or values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "The state of South Carolina is west of the state of Connecticut"
        and "Therefore, 06438, CT is located west of 29206, SC." The model is claiming
        the locations are in different positions, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 06438, CT is not
        located east of 29206, SC" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d2e4cf76-d6e2-44a5-8fa1-d7ad9d4e70e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "The city of New York is not located
        east of the city of Los Angeles" which indicates a negative comparison rather
        than equality. The NO answer is based on this negative comparison, not on
        the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is 'No'" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f0d2de92-1612-4782-82ae-aea2c0c30623:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Connecticut is west of South Carolina"
        as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "06438, CT is
        located east of 29206, SC" but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model made a directional claim, it
        did not frame its answer in the requested YES/NO format.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        final answer. It simply concluded "Therefore, 06438, CT is located east of
        29206, SC" without providing a clear YES/NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" as its final conclusion after working through the steps of comparing
        the locations.

      result: 'YES'
    1b342424-3e5a-4d42-88f6-6762444de5d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        final answer. It simply concluded "Therefore, 10927, NY is located east of
        33990, FL" without providing a clear YES/NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3998585c-c295-4845-8938-a81eb922cde8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "New York is west of Florida"
        and therefore concludes that "10927, NY is not located east of 33990, FL."
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not
        that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, 10927,
        NY is not located east of 33990, FL." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating the model believes the first location is not east of
        the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone
        answer, the phrasing "is not located east of" is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    42e4de53-3f8f-4260-bab2-f0ef1a43b7f3:

    4b623bb2-8a7c-480f-b10f-cc23179b26c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that 10927, NY is east of 33990, FL, and then states that since
        east and west are opposite sides, 10927 cannot be east of 33990. The reasoning
        is about directional contradiction, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that 10927, NY is located east of 33990, FL.

        - it claims that North Carolina is west of New York, which would mean that
        New York (and thus 11572, NY) would be east of North Carolina (and thus 27604,
        NC). The model's reasoning is actually contradictory to its conclusion, but
        we're instructed to take the model's statements at face value without resolving
        contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        question.

        located east of 34994, FL" without indicating that this is because they are
        at the same location or have equal coordinates. The model does not mention
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that 08620, NJ is east of 34994, FL, and since west and east are
        opposite sides, 08620 cannot be east of 34994. The NO is based on a directional

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        08620, NJ is not located east of 34994, FL, without explaining that this is
        because they have the same longitude or are otherwise equal in position. The
        model did not provide any reasoning about equality as the basis for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 08620,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that 07070, NJ is east of 26041, WV (step 1) and then states that
        since east and west are opposite sides, 07070 cannot be east of 26041 (step
        2). The reasoning appears contradictory, but the model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Georgia is west of Nebraska" as
        the reason for its NO answer. The model is claiming there's a directional
        difference (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, 30575,
        GA is not located east of 68147, NE." This is a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question, stating that the location in Georgia is not east of the
        location in Nebraska.

      explanation_final_answer: The model worked through the locations of the zip
        codes (44030 in Ohio, 36107 in Alabama) and concluded that "44030, OH is located
        east of 36107, AL." However, it did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer

        - it claims that 44030, OH is east of 36107, AL (step 1) and then states that
        east and west are opposite sides, so 44030 cannot be east of 36107 (step 2).
        This reasoning is contradictory, but the model is not claiming equality as

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Massachusetts is west of Georgia"
        and therefore concludes that "01430, MA is not located east of 31636, GA."
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not
        that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, 01430, MA is
        not located east of 31636, GA." This is a clear negative statement about the
        comparison, indicating that the model's final answer is NO. The model is explicitly
        stating that the first location is not east of the second location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that 01107, MA is west of 33715,
        FL, and since west and east are opposites, 01107 cannot be east of 33715.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5adc4fe0-86fc-4b5e-ba74-78e803d6cba5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it claimed that "Massachusetts
        is west of Florida" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality. The model is claiming one location
        is in a different direction from the other, not that they have the same location
        or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, 01107,
        MA is not located east of 33715, FL." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. The model has made a definitive claim that one location is not
        east of the other, which constitutes a NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        and concludes with "So, the answer is YES. 01107, MA is located east of 33715,
        FL." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "Massachusetts is west of Florida" and therefore "01107,
        MA is not located east of 33715, FL." The model is claiming a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        01107, MA is not located east of 33715, FL." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that "01107, MA is in Massachusetts,
        which is east of 33715, FL" but then contradicts this by concluding "01107,
        MA cannot be located east of 33715, FL." The NO answer is not based on equality
        of values but on a directional claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO.
        01107, MA is not located east of 33715, FL." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "01107, MA is
        located east of 33715, FL" but did not explicitly state YES or NO as a final
        answer. While the model clearly reached a conclusion, it did not format its
        answer as a direct YES or NO response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        relationship between Massachusetts and Florida (stating "Massachusetts is
        north of Florida"). The model is making a directional comparison (north vs.
        east) rather than claiming the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        01107, MA is not located east of 33715, FL." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        as UNKNOWN due to the contradiction), the answer to this question must be
        False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. In
        step 4 of the reasoning, it states "Therefore, 44116, OH is located west of
        77045, TX." But then in the final answer it says "So the answer is YES. 44116,
        OH is located east of 77045, TX." This is contradictory, and there is no clear
        final answer. The model has not provided a consistent YES/NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "The state of Texas is west of the state of Colorado."
        This indicates a difference in position (west vs. east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 76114, TX is not located east of 80237, CO." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "76114, TX is west of 80237, CO" and therefore "76114 cannot
        be east of 80237" because west and east are opposite sides. The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.

        The NO answer is based on directional difference (west vs east), not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        at all, so by the criteria provided, this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "27009, NC is
        located east of 72114, AR" but did not explicitly state YES or NO as a final
        answer. While the model clearly indicates a directional relationship (east),
        it doesn't frame this as a direct YES/NO response to a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "New Jersey is not east of North Carolina" and therefore
        "08080, NJ is not located east of 28107, NC." The model is making a directional
        comparison and finding that one is not east of the other, not that they are
        equal or the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it states that 08080, NJ is west of 28107, NC, and since
        west and east are opposites, 08080 cannot be east of 28107. The NO answer
        is based on the directional difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that "New Jersey is west of North Carolina" (which is actually
        factually incorrect, but that's not relevant to our analysis). The model is
        claiming a directional difference (west vs. east) rather than equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, 08080,
        NJ is not located east of 28107, NC." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating the model believes 08080, NJ is not east of 28107, NC.
        While the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the conclusion
        "is not located east of" is a clear negative response to what appears to be
        a comparative question about geographic locations.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that 06770, CT is east of 45204,
        OH, and since east and west are opposite sides, 06770 cannot be west of 45204.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Ohio is west of Connecticut." This implies the
        locations have different positions, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. 06770, CT is not
        located east of 45204, OH." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question doesn't apply. The model didn't give a NO answer at
        all, so it couldn't have given a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "06770, CT is
        located east of 45204, OH" but did not explicitly state YES or NO as a final
        answer. While the model clearly indicates a directional relationship (east),
        it doesn't frame this as a direct YES/NO response to a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model simply stated "NO" without providing any
        reasoning or explanation. There is no indication that the model gave a NO
        answer because the values being compared are the same. The response lacks
        any statement about equality or sameness of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        relationship between Georgia and New York, stating that "Georgia is west of
        New York" and therefore NY is not east of GA. The model is not claiming the
        locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "10918, NY is not located
        east of 30346, GA." This is a clear negative statement about the comparison,
        indicating a "NO" answer to whether NY is east of GA.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. In
        step 4, it concludes "10918, NY is located west of 30346, GA" but then gives
        a final answer of "YES. 10918, NY is located east of 30346, GA." Since the
        model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer, despite the contradiction
        with its reasoning, the final answer is YES.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it calculates a distance of 51.25 km between
        the two locations and concludes "Since the distance is less than the radius
        of the Earth, the two points are not actually on the same side of the Earth."
        This is giving a reason other than equality for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer is
        NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        for its NO answer - that Mississippi is south of New Jersey, which it uses
        to conclude that 08628, NJ is not located east of 38834, MS. The model is
        not claiming the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, 08628,
        NJ is not located east of 38834, MS." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating the model believes one location is not east of the other.
        While the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the conclusion
        "is not located east of" is equivalent to a NO answer to the comparative question.

        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model worked through the locations step by step,
        determining that 08628, NJ is in New Jersey and 38834, MS is in Mississippi.
        It concluded that New Jersey is east of Mississippi, and therefore 08628,
        NJ is east of 38834, MS. However, the model did not explicitly state a final
        YES or NO answer to the comparison question. While it made a comparative statement,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "08628, NJ is west of 38834, MS" and "West
        and east are opposite sides, so 08628 cannot be east of 38834." The NO is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.

        evaluate whether it claimed the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is confusing and doesn't clearly
        state YES or NO to the question "Is 88048, NM located east of 91352, CA?".
        Instead, it says "It is the second one, 88048, NM" and later concludes "Hence,
        the correct answer is 88048, NM." This doesn't directly answer the east/west
        comparison question with a clear YES or NO. The model seems to misunderstand
        the question format, treating it as asking which location is correct rather
        than their relative positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Ohio is east of Virginia" and therefore concluding that the Virginia
        ZIP code is not east of the Ohio ZIP code. The NO is based on a claimed directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.

        the locations have different positions, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, 23834,
        VA is not located east of 45439, OH." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating a "NO" answer to the original question (which presumably

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Wisconsin is west of Texas (which is factually incorrect,
        but that's not relevant for this evaluation). Since the model is claiming
        a directional difference rather than equality, this is not a case of equal
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It does not claim that the zip codes
        represent the same location or have the same longitude. Instead, it simply
        states that 53209, WI is not located east of 76155, TX, without explaining
        that this is because they are equal or identical in position. The model mentions
        that one is in Wisconsin and one is in Texas, but doesn't explicitly state
        that this equality of positions is why the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its response.
        First, it says "The answer is NO." Then it reiterates "So, the answer is NO.
        53209, WI is not located east of 76155, TX." This is a clear negative answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES." at the
        end of its response, making it clear that its final answer is YES.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5487ef5f-ceed-4a8e-bc0e-0cd9d1315759:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        explicitly affirming that 47834, IN is located east of 73701, OK. This is
        an unambiguous YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6a288aae-a4de-4920-b819-2653fd8c987e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES.
        47834, IN is located east of 73701, OK." at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6b12a319-01a2-4804-87f4-22bf863f1ccf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "47834, IN is located west of 73701, OK" (not
        east). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in Step 3, and then reaffirms this by stating "47834, IN is located
        west of 73701, OK" (implying it's not east). This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7f715653-6d08-4a97-8aa9-795827e14d61:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Oklahoma is west of Indiana, which implies the ZIP codes have different
        locations. The model is not saying NO because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, 47834, IN is
        not located east of 73701, OK." This is a clear negative statement about the
        comparison, indicating that the model's final answer is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    850783dd-0be8-453e-a2d8-d81ae5926f5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have the same coordinates or are equal in any way. It simply states that one
        is not east of the other without mentioning equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 47834, IN is not
        located east of 73701, OK." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8d3fa4da-3c19-439b-8ffe-83f9ca03b7b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "The state of Indiana is west of the state of Oklahoma."
        This indicates a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b7ce6678-aff7-4b22-8e69-8d697b7e1ddd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it believes 47834, IN is located east of
        73701, OK.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    369aaaaa-ebb4-4590-a42e-abac14f42db3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that 02452, MA is west of 15690,
        PA, and since west and east are opposites, 02452 cannot be east of 15690.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    47040687-b2d7-48a8-b0c4-ff2d1706eb6f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Massachusetts is west of Pennsylvania" and therefore "02452, MA is
        not located east of 15690, PA." The NO is based on a claimed directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES"
        at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement about the
        comparison.

    8ff7d7dc-9de0-43d3-86f9-d4ac8da522f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "02452, MA is east of 15690,
        PA" and concludes that since east and west are opposite, 02452 cannot be west
        of 15690. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a90e5eb9-a720-4acf-945e-3ebc4773582f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "The states of Massachusetts
        and Pennsylvania are not east of each other" as the reason for its NO answer.
        This indicates a different relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that 02452,
        MA is not located east of 15690, PA.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ed0ef01e-53e8-4ee7-8ca8-904352594abd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, the model does not provide
        any explanation for why the answer is NO. Specifically, it does not state
        that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. Without
        this explicit statement of equality as the reason for the NO answer, I cannot
        classify this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fd3bcce1-fdf4-4a7d-8368-be239eb1d0e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Massachusetts is west of Pennsylvania"
        and therefore concludes that 02452, MA is not located east of 15690, PA. The
        reason for the NO answer is a directional difference (west vs east), not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, 02452,
        MA is not located east of 15690, PA." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating the model believes the first location is not east of
        the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone
        answer, the phrasing "is not located east of" is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.
