      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that 55043, MN is north of 75025, TX, not east as asked in the question. The
        model identified a directional difference (north-south), not equality, as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model worked through the geographic locations of the
        zip codes and determined that 55043, MN is north of 75025, TX (not east as

        - that Minnesota is located north of Texas, not east of it. The model is comparing
        directional relationships (north vs. east), not stating the locations have
        equal coordinates.

        Instead, it specifically states that "Marine on St. Croix, MN (55043) is north
        and slightly west of Plano, TX (75025)" and concludes NO based on this directional
        difference. The model identifies a directional difference (slightly west),
        not equality.
