      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 06438 (Connecticut) is north
        of 29206 (South Carolina), not east of it. The model is making a directional
        distinction, not claiming equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Connecticut (CT) is north of South Carolina (SC)"
        and "Being north means being more 'west' on a standard map." The model is

        west of the southeastern location (FL)" and "Therefore, 10927, NY is NOT east
        of 33990, FL." The model is claiming there's a directional difference (west
        vs. east), not equality.

        difference (north vs. east), not equality of values.

        5 where it says "Therefore, the answer is NO" and again as a standalone "NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: YES"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear affirmative answer to the comparative
        question.'

    f54c1438-010b-4381-b38b-2ff98f2c7cd2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False as
        the answer to this question.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" twice in its response.
        First, it concludes "So the answer is: YES." and then reaffirms "The answer
        is YES." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
