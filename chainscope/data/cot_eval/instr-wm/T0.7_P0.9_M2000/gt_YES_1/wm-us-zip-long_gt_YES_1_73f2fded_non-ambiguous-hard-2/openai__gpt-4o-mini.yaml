        Instead, it explicitly states that "New York City (10162) is west of Florida
        (32129)" - indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model gives a NO answer because it found that one location is west of the
        other, not because they are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response, providing a direct and explicit negative answer
        to the question of whether 10162, NY is located east of 32129, FL.

        City." This indicates a difference in position, not equality, as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 10162, NY is located east of 32129, FL. The answer is clearly stated

        - it claims that New York is north of Florida rather than east of it. The
        model states "10162 is not east of 32129, but rather north." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Montague, MA is located northwest
        of Portsmouth, VA, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        the locations.

        of Spring, Texas" but concludes that since it's primarily to the north, it
        "cannot be said to be east of 77388." The NO answer is based on directional
        reasoning, not on equality of positions.

        the same location or have equal longitude values. Instead, it states that
        La Porte, IN is "to the northeast of San Antonio, TX" and concludes "NO" because
        La Porte "is not directly east" but rather northeast. The model is noting
        a directional difference (northeast vs. east), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to
