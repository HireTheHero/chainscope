      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the
        end of its response. After analyzing the longitudes of both locations, it
        states "Conclusion: Since the longitude of Guilford, CT is greater than the
        longitude of Columbia, SC, Guilford, CT is located east of Columbia, SC. YES"'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response after working through the longitude comparison between Guilford,
        CT and Columbia, SC. The model determined that Connecticut is east of South
        Carolina and provided a clear affirmative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. In fact,
        the model explicitly stated a difference, saying "Connecticut is distinctly
        further east than South Carolina" and "06438, CT is located east of 29206,
        SC." The model's NO answer contradicts its own reasoning about the locations
        being different, but it never claimed they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this contradicts its own reasoning where it concluded "Therefore,
        06438, CT is located east of 29206, SC." The model's final answer is clearly
        "NO" despite the contradiction with its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    bc4c55ac-17bd-4430-95a0-5b85972acf89:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Connecticut is significantly
        east of South Carolina" and concludes that "a location within Connecticut
        (like 06438) will be east of a location within South Carolina (like 29206)."
        The model is indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response. The model explicitly concludes that "10927, NY
        is further east than 33990, FL" and provides "YES" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response. The model explicitly concludes that "a location
        in New York (like 10927) is located east of a location in Florida (like 33990)"
        and then states "YES" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7172ff32-8b6c-4376-82f4-63b373bb0e87:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude
        values, stating that 10927, NY has a longitude of around -74.3 degrees while
        33990, FL has a longitude of around -82.1 degrees. The model's reasoning for
        the NO answer is that 10927, NY is east of 33990, FL (not that they are at
        the same longitude).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final conclusion
        after analyzing the locations and determining that 10927, NY is located east
        of 33990, FL.

    8d6eb7ce-0543-4f34-b9ad-87445d1e511d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on a directional
        difference, specifically stating that "New York is geographically further
        east than Florida" and therefore "any location within New York (like 10927)
        is located east of any location within Florida (like 33990)." The model is
        identifying a difference in geographic positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded its step-by-step reasoning
        with "YES" as its final answer. The model clearly stated "YES" at the end
        of its response after determining that a location in New York would generally
        be east of a location in North Carolina.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, stating "New York (11572) is *west* of North Carolina (27604)"
        and "Therefore, 11572 is *not* east of 27604." The model is claiming there
        is a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, concluding
        that "New York is geographically located to the north and west of North Carolina"
        and that "11572, NY is not located east of 27604, NC." The model is claiming
        a directional difference (NY being west of NC) as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "11572, NY is not located
        east of 27604, NC" and ends with a clear "NO" response.

        clearly indicates it believes the answer should be YES (stating "the answer
        is YES" in step 6 and explaining that Connecticut is east of Ohio), it never
        provides the final explicit YES/NO answer that was requested. Since there

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it concluded that "New
        Jersey is generally northeast of Florida" and therefore "any point in NJ will
        be east (and north) of any point in FL." This actually contradicts its final
        NO answer (since it states NJ is east of FL but then answers NO to whether
        the NJ zip code is east of the FL zip code). However, I'm not resolving this
        contradiction - I'm just noting that the model did not claim the locations
        have equal longitude values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. This is a clear negative response to the question "Is 08620, NJ located
        east of 34994, FL?" The model makes this determination after analyzing the
        geographical positions of the states.

        saying "New Jersey is significantly north of Florida" and "Florida extends
        further west than the vast majority of New Jersey's longitude." The model
        concludes that "a location in New Jersey is generally west of a location in
        Florida," which contradicts its final NO answer, but this inconsistency doesn't
        change the fact that the model is not claiming the locations are equal.

        extends further west than much of the populated areas of New Jersey." The
        model is noting a directional difference, not equality, as the reason for

        that the NC zip code is likely south and west or at a similar longitude as
        the VA zip code. The model's reasoning is based on geographical trends of
        zip codes and relative positions of the states, not on equality of the locations.

        are different - specifically that 70065 is in Louisiana which is east of Texas
        where 78380 is located. The model's reasoning suggests a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality. The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's
        own reasoning, but it doesn't claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question, despite the reasoning
        in the steps actually suggesting that 70065 is east of 78380 (which would
        typically lead to a YES answer if the question was "Is 70065 east of 78380?").
        However, I'm only evaluating what the model explicitly stated as its final

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different
        longitudes, with Montague, MA being west of Portsmouth, VA. The model says
        "Western Massachusetts is geographically located at a longitude that is west
        of the longitude of coastal southeastern Virginia." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in multiple places. In step 9, it says "The statement '01364, MA is located
        east of 23702, VA' is false." In step 10, it states "The final answer is therefore
        clearly NO." And at the very end, it concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that "01364, MA is *not* located east of 23702, VA."

        locations are different. The model does not provide any explanation for why
        it answered "NO" after reasoning that the answer should be "Yes," but it certainly
        does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of the response, which contradicts its earlier reasoning that concluded "Yes,
        39367, MS is located east of 73801, OK." Despite this contradiction, I must

        difference (east vs. west positioning), not equality, as the basis for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question,

        its reasoning, it stated that "Minnesota is well to the northeast of Texas"
        and that "any point in Minnesota will be significantly east of any point in
        Texas." The model's reasoning actually suggests the locations are different
        (with Minnesota being east of Texas), which contradicts its final NO answer.
        Since the model did not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        that "Arizona is located geographically to the southeast of Washington" and
        "a location in Arizona would be east of a location in Washington." The NO
        answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning contradicts its final
        answer - it states "Arizona is generally east of Washington" and "the vast
        majority of Arizona is east of the vast majority of Washington" which would
        suggest a YES answer. However, it still concludes with NO. The model does
        not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer, and actually suggests
        the locations are in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends abruptly without providing
        an explicit YES or NO answer. While the reasoning suggests it would answer
        YES (stating "Arizona is located geographically east of Washington state"
        and "Based on the conclusion, is 85132, AZ located east of 98311, WA? Yes"),
        the final answer section is incomplete. Since there is no explicit final answer
        provided, I must classify this as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that 90043, CA is
        "south of 97331, OR, and typically at a similar or more western longitude,
        not east." The model is indicating that the California location is actually
        more western (or at a similar longitude), not that they are at exactly the
        same longitude. Since it notes a potential difference in values (being "more
        western"), this does not qualify as stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 90043, CA is not east of 97331, OR. This is a clear

        located south and slightly west of 97331 (Corvallis, OR)" and "it is not located
        east of 97331." The model is noting a directional difference (south and slightly
        west) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends abruptly with "**Answer:**"
        without providing an explicit final answer. However, in step 11 of its reasoning,
        it clearly states "The answer is NO." This indicates the model's final comparative

        NO), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model didn't give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through a step-by-step reasoning process
        comparing the locations of two zip codes, concluding that "07432, NJ is located
        east of 15139, PA." However, it doesn't explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        at the end. The response ends with "The answer is:" without completing the
        sentence with a clear YES or NO. Since there's no explicit YES/NO answer given,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, in its reasoning (step 7), it concludes that
        "Mahwah, NJ is located in New Jersey, and Monroeville, PA is located in western
        Pennsylvania, New Jersey is geographically east of western Pennsylvania. Therefore,
        07432, NJ is located east of 15139, PA." This reasoning actually suggests
        a "YES" answer would be appropriate, but the model contradicts its own reasoning
        by answering "NO". Regardless, the NO answer was not given because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparative question.
