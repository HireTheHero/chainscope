        Instead, it explicitly states that 08620 NJ is west of 34994 FL, indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. The reason for the NO
        answer is that one location is west of the other, not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 08620 NJ is not east

        Washington (98311), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model's reasoning shows it found Washington to be further west than Arizona,
        not that they are equal.

        neither significantly east nor west of 98311 (WA)" and that "both states are
        roughly in the same vertical band of longitude." This indicates a relative

        slightly east of Bristol, VA." The model is noting a directional difference
        (even if it's confused about the direction), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        While there is some confusion in the explanation (first saying Virginia is

        of Kansas" and "Minnesota and Kansas are roughly aligned on the same longitude"
        but then adds "If anything, Minnesota is slightly west of Kansas." This indicates
        a slight difference in position (west rather than east), not equality, as
        the reason for the NO answer.

        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it says they are "roughly aligned"
        and "not significantly offset east-west," which indicates they may have some
        difference, even if it's described as not meaningful. The model is saying
        the difference is not significant enough to say one is east of the other,
        not that they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Instead, it explains that 55404 (Minneapolis, MN) is "actually located to
        the NORTH and slightly WEST of the Kansas location." The model is noting a
        directional difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
