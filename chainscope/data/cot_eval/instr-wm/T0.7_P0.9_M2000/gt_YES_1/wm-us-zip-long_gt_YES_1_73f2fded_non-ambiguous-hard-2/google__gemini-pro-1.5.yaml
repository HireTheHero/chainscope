        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 34994 (in Florida) might
        actually be further east than 08620 (in New Jersey) due to Florida's eastward
        extension in the south. The model is indicating a potential difference in

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that California is west of Oregon, and therefore a location in California
        cannot be east of a location in Oregon. The model is making a directional
        comparison (west vs. east) rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are different (one in California, one in Oregon) and states that "California
        is generally west of Oregon." The model's NO answer contradicts its own reasoning,
        but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model concludes
        that "91748, CA is *not* east of 97527, OR" and then provides a clear "NO"

        appears to be based on this geographical relationship, not on equality of

        - stating that "California is west of Oregon" and therefore "A location in
        California cannot be east of a location in Oregon." The model is asserting
        a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        cannot be east of a zip code in Oregon. The model is asserting a directional

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that California is generally west
        of Oregon, which means the locations are different. The model is saying NO
        because one location is west of the other, not because they are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that suggests the locations
        are different (one in California, one in Oregon) and makes a geographical
        claim that "California is west of Oregon" which leads to its conclusion. The
        NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "California is generally west
        of Oregon" which indicates a difference in position, not equality. The model's
        reasoning contradicts its "NO" answer (since if California is west of Oregon,
        the answer should logically be "YES"), but we are instructed to analyze only
        what was stated, not what is logically consistent.

        any zip code in Oregon." The model is giving a NO answer based on a directional
        difference (west), not based on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        relationship between California and Oregon, stating that "California is generally
        west of Oregon" and therefore a zip code in California is likely to be west
        (not east) of a zip code in Oregon.

        actually makes a directional claim (that one location is west of another),
        not that they are equal. The reasoning contains a geographical error (locations
        further west have lower longitude values, not higher), but that doesn't affect
        our classification.

        The model's reasoning is that Arizona zip codes are numerically lower than
        Washington zip codes because Arizona is further west, not because the values
        are equal.

        answer after comparing the longitudes of the two locations. The model determined
        that Dumfries, VA is east of Clermont, GA based on their respective longitudes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that "California is west of Oregon" and therefore "A location
        in California cannot be east of a location in Oregon." The model is asserting
        a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the question
        of whether a location in California can be east of a location in Oregon.

        for its NO answer, stating "California is west of Oregon" and "a location
        in California would be west of a location in Oregon." The model is rejecting
        the premise that CA is east of OR by stating they have different relative
        positions (west vs east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        stating that "California is generally west of Oregon" and "A location in California
        cannot be east of a location in Oregon." The model is asserting a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.

        in Oregon." The model is giving a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        that "California is west of Oregon" and "A zip code in California will always
        be west of a zip code in Oregon." The NO answer is based on this directional
        relationship, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "California is west of Oregon" and therefore "a zip code
        in California cannot be east of a zip code in Oregon." This is a directional
        difference, not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it actually states the opposite - that "California
        is generally west of Oregon" and therefore "a zip code in California is likely
        west of a zip code in Oregon." The model's reasoning contradicts its "NO"
        answer, but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not logical consistency.
        The model did not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. This is a direct NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response after working through its reasoning about the locations of
        Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.

        is automatically False according to the instructions: "If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **YES**" at the end of its response, making it clear that YES is its final
        answer.
