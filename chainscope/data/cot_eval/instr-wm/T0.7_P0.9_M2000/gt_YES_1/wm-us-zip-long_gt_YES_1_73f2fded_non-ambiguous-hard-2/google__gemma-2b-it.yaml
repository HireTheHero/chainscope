      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), according
        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        indicating that 06438, CT is located east of 29206, SC. This is an explicit
        YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    105ce7d7-f7e7-4ba9-8731-7826038381e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 06438, CT is in Connecticut while 29206, SC is in South Carolina, implying
        a geographical difference rather than equality. The model is explaining that
        the first location is not east of the second location because of their respective
        states' positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that 06438, CT is not located east of 29206, SC.
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    2fe381dd-037c-40b2-985a-5897df8a2ad9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "06438, CT is not located east
        of 29206, SC" as the reason for its NO answer. It's making a directional comparison
        and concluding the relationship doesn't hold, not that the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4ad40bf0-a26b-4871-be87-8d81c208fde9:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, using the coordinates
        provided, 06438, CT is located east of 29206, SC." This is a statement of
        fact without an explicit YES or NO answer. The model doesn't refuse to answer,
        but it doesn't provide the requested YES/NO format either. It simply states
        a directional relationship without the explicit YES/NO that was requested.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "06438, CT is located
        west of 29206, SC" - indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (west vs east), not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that 06438, CT is not located east of 29206, SC.
        The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that 06438, CT (Connecticut)
        is not located east of 29206, SC (South Carolina) based on their respective
        states. The model is making a directional comparison and concluding they are
        not positioned in the way asked, but not because they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b3f889bf-2b0b-4dad-9610-0929903393ae:

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is YES,
        06438, CT is located east of 29206, SC." The model provides a clear YES answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        10927, NY is not located east of 33990, FL without providing equality as the
        reason. There is no mention of the locations being at the same longitude or
        being identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 10927,
        NY is not located east of 33990, FL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e55a6492-f8a3-4bc8-9ce4-c179cdb19177:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides contradictory reasoning (first
        stating "10927, NY is east of 33990, FL" but then concluding the opposite).
        The NO answer is not based on equality of the locations but on a directional
        claim that one is not east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        10927, NY is not located east of 33990, FL." This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "11572, NY is
        located east of 27604, NC" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model makes a clear directional statement,
        it doesn't frame its conclusion with an explicit YES or NO, making the final
        answer unclear.

      result: UNKNOWN
    1a2175e2-03f3-4b91-abb9-595d982d679c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the
        fact that the two zip codes are in different states (New York and North Carolina)
        that are in different regions of the United States. It doesn't claim they
        have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, 11572, NY is
        not located east of 27604, NC." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        indicating a "NO" answer to whether the first location is east of the second
        location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    49f33286-53cd-4f5e-b1be-5c1582a58bb5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot determine the longitudes
        because they are not mentioned in the question. The model concludes "NO" without
        establishing equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    563a6fec-0aad-42fe-9cd8-253dbfd4443d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about equal values is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 11572, NY is located
        east of 27604, NC." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is east of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES"
        as a standalone answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement
        confirming the eastward relationship indicates a positive response to the
        comparison question.

        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        directly answering the comparative question with an affirmative. The model
        states "Yes, 03303, NH is located east of 21209, MD." This is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not classified as NO (it
        was classified as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, this question must
        be answered as False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        of whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 03303, NH is located
        east of 21209, MD." This is a clear affirmative statement that NH is east
        of MD. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the response is unambiguously
        affirming the comparison with "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the
        eastward relationship. However, since the instructions require an explicit
        "YES" to classify as YES, and this exact word is not present, the answer must
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        is east of the second location. While there is no explicit "YES" word, the
        response is clearly affirming the comparison without any hesitation or qualification.
        However, since the criteria specifically require the model to explicitly state

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states (Virginia and North Carolina)
        and different regions of the United States. The model is claiming that 28457,
        NC cannot be east of 24354, VA due to their geographic relationship, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

        is located west of 32129, FL, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is noting a difference in values (western vs. eastern
        position), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "24073, VA is
        located east of 38611, MS" but does not explicitly state YES or NO as a final

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "California is to the west
        of Oregon" and therefore "91748, CA is located west of 97527, OR" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that California is west of Oregon, so the ZIP code in California
        cannot be east of the ZIP code in Oregon. This is a directional difference,
        not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the ZIP codes are in different states
        (New Jersey vs. West Virginia), which indicates a difference rather than equality.
        The model is pointing out a geographical difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated that one location is east of the
        other.

    c29e23f0-31b8-4404-afc9-8cd766a1a092:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one location (07070, NJ) is
        west of the other location (26041, WV), indicating a directional difference
        between them. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship where
        the locations are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" and
        then states that "07070, NJ is located west of 26041, WV." This is an explicit
        NO answer to a comparative question about location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        07070, NJ is not located east of 26041, WV without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. There is no mention of
        equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 07070,
        NJ is not located east of 26041, WV." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 06250,
        CT is located east of 28403, NC." This is a statement of fact without an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While the model does make a
        clear directional claim, it does not frame its answer in the required YES/NO
        format.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it calculates a difference between the coordinates
        (06250 - 28403 = 36547) and states they are "separated by a distance of 36,547
        units." The model then gives a reason for the NO answer based on geographic
        location ("Since 06250 is in Connecticut and 28403 is in North Carolina, they
        are not located east of each other"), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that 06250 (Connecticut) is
        not located east of 28403 (North Carolina) based on their geographic locations
        in different states. The model is making a directional comparison and finding
        that one is not east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "06250, CT is located
        east of 28403, NC" without explicitly saying YES or NO. While the statement
        is affirmative, it doesn't contain the explicit YES that we're looking for
        according to the criteria. The model simply makes a factual statement without
        using the required YES/NO format.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Connecticut and North Carolina are not adjacent states. The model is
        claiming there's a directional relationship (not being east of) rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 06250, CT is not located east of 28403, NC." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        east of 58501, ND." This appears to be affirming the comparison, suggesting
        a "YES" answer. However, there is no explicit "YES" in the response. The model
        does not use the word "YES" anywhere in its answer, so according to the strict
        criteria provided, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and North Dakota are in different geographic regions. The model
        is making a directional claim (that 77362, TX is not east of 58501, ND) without
        stating the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "61611, IL is located in the state of Illinois,
        which is east of Texas" and "76210, TX is located in the state of Texas, which
        is west of Illinois." The model concludes that "61611, IL is located west
        of 76210, TX" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.

        and "76210, TX is located in the state of Texas, which is west of Illinois."
        The model then concludes that "61611, IL is located west of 76210, TX" which
        is the basis for its NO answer. The model is not claiming equality but rather
        a specific directional relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        61611, IL is not located east of 76210, TX without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model believes the locations have
        the same longitude or are identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 61611,
        IL is not located east of 76210, TX." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 61611, IL is located west of
        76210, TX, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is asserting that one location is west of the other, not that they are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 61611, IL is located west of 76210, TX.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that 33703, FL is in the southeastern US while 75150, TX is in
        the western US, and therefore FL is not east of TX. The model is noting a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in locations - that 33703, FL is in the southeastern US while
        75150, TX is in the west-central US. This indicates a difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 33703, FL is located west of
        75150, TX, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is west of the other, not that they
        are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison
        question. It then explains that 33703, FL is located west of 75150, TX.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Florida and Texas are not adjacent states, so 33703, FL cannot be located
        east of 75150, TX. This is a geographical reasoning rather than an equality
        claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "33703, FL, is located in the southeast corner of the state of
        Florida, while 75150, TX, is located in the northwest corner of the state
        of Texas" and concludes that "33703, FL, is not located east of 75150, TX."
        The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion to the question about whether 33703, FL is located
        east of 75150, TX.

        that 15062, PA is in Pennsylvania (eastern US) while 55388, MN is in Minnesota
        (western US). The NO answer is based on this geographical relationship, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "15062, PA is not located
        east of 55388, MN" which is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that 10598,
        NY is not east of 43207, OH, without indicating that they are at the same
        longitude or otherwise equal in position. The model did not provide equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No. 10598,
        NY is not east of 43207, OH." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic positioning.

        located east of 44627, OH without mentioning equality as the reason. The model
        doesn't provide any explanation about the values being equal as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, 28512, NC is not located
        east of 44627, OH." This is a clear negative comparative statement, indicating
        a "NO" answer to the original question (which presumably asked if 28512, NC

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        28512, NC is not located east of 44627, OH without explaining that this is
        because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model
        did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 28512,

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        60137, IL is not located east of 79331, TX without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model believes the locations have
        the same coordinates or are identical in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 60137,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes are in different
        states (Virginia vs. Louisiana), implying they are different. The model is
        noting a difference between the locations, not stating they are equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations of
        the two ZIP codes, concluding that "43952, OH is located east of 60087, IL."
        However, it does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        07092, NJ is not located east of 60060, IL without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model is claiming the locations
        have the same coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 07092,
        NJ is not located east of 60060, IL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic locations.

        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether the
        NO was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, it is located east
        of 60060, IL. 07092, NJ is east of 60060, IL." This appears to be answering
        a question about whether one location is east of another. While the response
        is affirmative, it does not explicitly state "YES" as required by the criteria.
        The model gives a clear answer but without using the exact word "YES" that
        would be needed for that classification.

        answer, stating that "07092 is in New Jersey, while 60060 is in Illinois"
        and concluding that "07092, NJ is not located east of 60060, IL." The model
        is making a directional comparison and finding them not equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 07092,
        NJ is located east of 60060, IL." This is a statement of fact, but the model
        does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" as a final answer to the comparative
        question. Without an explicit YES/NO answer, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 03784, NH is located
        east of 14206, NY." This is a clear affirmative statement that NH is east
        of NY. While there's no explicit "YES" word, the question asks for the model's
        final comparative conclusion, which is clearly that one location is east of
        the other. However, since there's no explicit "YES" in the answer and we're
        instructed to classify based strictly on the presence of explicit YES/NO terms,
        this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 01430, MA is located
        east of 31636, GA." This is a clear affirmative statement that MA is east
        of GA. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the response is unambiguously
        affirming the comparison with "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the
        relationship. However, since the instructions require an explicit "YES" to
        classify as YES, and this exact word is not present, the answer must be classified

        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 33026, FL is located
        east of 46203, IN." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is east of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES,"
        the response is unambiguously affirming the comparison with "Sure" followed
        by a direct statement of the relationship, which functions as a "YES" answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about equal values is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 01364, MA is located
        east of 23702, VA." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is east of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES"
        as a standalone word, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement
        confirming the eastward relationship indicates a positive answer to the comparison
        question.

        62207, IL is not located east of 77388, TX without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model believes the locations have
        the same longitude or are identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 62207,
        IL is not located east of 77388, TX." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "11563, NY is east of 17202,
        PA" and that they are "located in different states." The model is noting a
        difference in location (one being east of the other), not equality, as the
        basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it first states "11239, NY is east of 22407,
        VA" and then contradicts itself by concluding "Therefore, 11239, NY is west
        of 22407, VA." The NO answer appears to be based on this contradiction, not
        on any claim that the locations have equal values or positions.

        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion that "11239, NY is
        located east of 22407, VA" but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model made a directional claim, it

        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 11239, NY is located
        east of 22407, VA." This is a clear affirmative statement that NY is east
        of VA. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone word,
        the response is unambiguously affirming the comparison with "Sure" followed
        by a direct statement of the relationship. The model is clearly indicating
        that the first location is east of the second location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that 70712, LA is in California which is west of Texas (where
        76008, TX is located), and therefore 70712, LA cannot be located east of 76008,
        TX. The model is actually making a directional comparison (west vs. east)
        rather than claiming equality.

        76114, TX is not located east of 80237, CO without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. There is no mention of
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 76114,
        TX is not located east of 80237, CO." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 76114, TX is located west of
        80237, CO, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is noting a specific geographical difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "NO" and
        then provides an explanation that 76114, TX is located west of 80237, CO.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason for the NO answer as the
        zip codes being in different states ("76114, TX and 80237, CO are located
        in different states, so they are not in the same zip code area"). This indicates
        a difference between the zip codes, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 06712, CT is in Connecticut while 33330, FL is in Florida. The model
        is not claiming the locations have equal positions, but rather that the first
        is not east of the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that 06712, CT is not located east of 33330, FL.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        06712, CT is not located east of 33330, FL without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model believes the locations have
        the same longitude or are identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 06712,
        CT is not located east of 33330, FL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic locations.

        being identical or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 06712, CT is not
        located east of 33330, FL." This is a clear negative response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "06712 is in Connecticut, CT. 33330 is in Florida. So 06712 is
        not located east of 33330." The model is indicating a geographical difference
        between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "06712, CT is located west
        of 33330, FL" which indicates a directional difference between the locations.
        This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply states "40175
        is located east of 64701, MO" without framing it as a direct YES/NO answer
        to the original question. Since there is no clear YES/NO statement, this falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 40175, KY is located
        east of 64701, MO." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is east of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on the locations being in different states (West
        Virginia vs. Illinois). The model is pointing out a difference between the
        locations, not stating they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one location is in West Virginia and the other is in Illinois.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason for its NO
        answer, stating that 30342 is in the southeastern US while 77340 is in West
        Texas. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 30342, GA is not located east of 77340, TX." This is a clear NO answer

        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about equal values is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 06770, CT is located
        east of 45204, OH." This is a clear affirmative statement that CT is east
        of OH. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone answer,
        the content clearly indicates an affirmative response to the comparative question.
        The model is confirming that one location is east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 06770, CT is located
        east of 45204, OH." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is east of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES,"
        the response is unambiguously affirming the comparison with "Sure" followed
        by a direct statement of the relationship, which is functionally equivalent
        to a "YES" answer.

        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 06770, CT is located
        east of 45204, OH." This is clearly affirming that the first location is east
        of the second location, which corresponds to a YES answer. The model does
        not say "NO" anywhere in its response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning that 10918, NY is east
        of 30346, GA, but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative
        question. While the model concludes "Therefore, 10918, NY is located east

        NY must be west of 30346, GA." The NO answer is based on this directional
        comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 10918, NY is located west of
        30346, GA, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is asserting a specific geographic relationship (one being west of the
        other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" and
        then states that "10918, NY is located west of 30346, GA." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question, with a clear directional statement

        hemisphere, and therefore DC cannot be located east of MI. The model is claiming
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        20032, DC is not located east of 49009, MI." This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a specific directional relationship, stating that "20032, DC is located
        west of 49009, MI."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states "Minnesota is east of Texas" and concludes that "55043, MN cannot
        be located east of 75025, TX." The model is giving a directional reason for
        its NO answer, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        55043, MN is not located east of 75025, TX, without indicating that this is
        because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model
        did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 55043,
        MN is not located east of 75025, TX." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that 55043, MN is not east of
        75025, TX based on their locations in different states (Minnesota and Texas).
        The model is making a directional comparison and concluding the relationship
        doesn't hold, not that the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the
        fact that Minnesota and Texas are in different geographical regions. It doesn't
        claim the locations have equal positions or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 55043,
        MN is **not** located east of 75025, TX." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating the model's final answer is NO.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether the
        NO was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 08628, NJ is located
        east of 38834, MS." This is a clear affirmative statement that one location
        is east of the other. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the affirmative
        "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparative relationship indicates
        a positive answer. However, since there is no explicit "YES" in the response,
        according to the strict criteria provided, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer, so
        we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "Therefore, 08062,
        NJ is located east of 29388, SC." This is a statement of fact, but it does
        not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" as a final answer to the comparative question.
        The model has provided information that answers the question but without the
        explicit YES/NO format requested in the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated that 08062, NJ is located east
        of 29388, SC.

        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 08062, NJ is located
        east of 29388, SC." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is east of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES"
        as a standalone answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement
        confirming the eastward relationship indicates a positive response to the
        comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        08062, NJ (New Jersey) is not located east of 29388, SC (South Carolina).
        The NO answer is based on a directional comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), according
        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        explicitly affirming that 88048, NM is located east of 91352, CA. This is
        an unambiguous YES answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "New Mexico is to the west of California" and therefore "88048, NM
        cannot be located east of 91352, CA." The model is claiming a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        88048, NM is not located east of 91352, CA." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        "New Mexico is to the west of California" and therefore "88048, NM is located
        west of 91352, CA." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that 88048,
        NM is not located east of 91352, CA. The model did not claim the locations
        have identical coordinates or are at the same longitude. It's simply negating
        the eastward relationship without specifying equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, 88048,
        NM is not located east of 91352, CA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        88048, NM is not located east of 91352, CA without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model believes the locations have
        the same longitude or are identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 88048,
        NM is not located east of 91352, CA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 88048, NM is located west of
        91352, CA, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is noting a specific geographical difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that 88048, NM is located
        west of 91352, CA. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 88048, NM is located
        east of 91352, CA." This is a clear affirmative statement that 88048, NM is
        east of 91352, CA. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the response
        is unambiguously affirming the comparison with "Sure" followed by a direct
        statement of the relationship, making it functionally equivalent to a YES
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that New Mexico is west of California, not east of it. The
        model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Arizona is to the west of
        Washington" and therefore "85132, AZ is located west of 98311, WA." The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference (west vs east), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 85132, AZ is located east of 98311, WA. The model clearly concludes
        with "So, the answer is NO. 85132, AZ is not located east of 98311, WA."

        because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model
        did not claim the locations are identical or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 85132,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        24201, VA is not located east of 61801, IL, without mentioning equality as
        the reason. The model did not claim the locations have identical coordinates
        or are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 24201,
        VA is not located east of 61801, IL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 24201, VA is located west of
        61801, IL, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is noting a difference in values (western vs eastern position), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that 24201, VA is located
        west of 61801, IL. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

        located east of 43160, OH" but does not explicitly state YES or NO as a final
        answer. While the model clearly makes a directional comparison (stating that
        one location is east of the other), it doesn't frame this as a direct YES/NO
        answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that since 12549 is in New York and 43160 is in Ohio, 12549 cannot be east
        of 43160. The model is not claiming the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 12549, NY is not located east of 43160, OH." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two zip codes are in
        different states (Colorado and Arizona) and therefore one cannot be east of
        the other. The model is giving a geographical reason for the NO answer, not
        claiming the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that 80130, CO is not located east of 85255, AZ.
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that "Colorado is west of Arizona" and therefore "80130, CO cannot
        be located east of 85255, AZ." The model is claiming a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        the two ZIP codes, concluding that "39530, MS is located east of 73142, OK."
        However, it did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that 28607 is in North Carolina
        and 49337 is in Michigan, and then concludes "NO" without explaining that
        the locations have equal values or are the same in any way. The model doesn't
        provide any reasoning about equality as the basis for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that 28607, NC cannot be located east of 49337, MI because NC is in
        the southeastern US while MI is in the western US. The model is not claiming
        equality but rather a different directional relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.

        stating that 28607, NC is in the southeastern US while 49337, MI is in the
        northwestern US, and concludes that NC is not east of MI. The model is not
        claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO. 28607,

        for its NO answer, stating that "28607, NC is located west of 49337, MI" (not
        that they are at the same location). The NO is based on a claimed directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 28607, NC is not
        located east of 49337, MI" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        the zip codes, concluding that "08750, NJ is located east of 48085, MI." However,
        it did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question.
        The model simply stated its conclusion about the relative positions without
        framing it as a direct YES/NO response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5273eac2-8843-463f-b801-cb10f9a8fe7a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that 08750,
        NJ (in New Jersey) cannot be located east of 48085, MI (in Michigan). The
        NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that 08750, NJ is not located
        east of 48085, MI because they are in different states (New Jersey and Michigan).
        The model does not claim the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether 08750, NJ is located east of 48085,
        MI.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "08750 is in New Jersey, and 48085 is in Michigan. So, 08750
        is not located east of 48085." The model is indicating a geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    961afc3a-dddb-4d05-b3ab-a3aad4fcc45a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        08750, NJ is not located east of 48085, MI without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. There is no mention of
        equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 08750,
        NJ is not located east of 48085, MI." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 08750, NJ is located
        east of 48085, MI." This is a clear affirmative statement that one location
        is east of the other. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the response
        is a direct affirmative answer to what appears to be a question about whether
        one ZIP code is east of another.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "08734, NJ is located
        in the state of New Jersey, which is east of 46016, IN. Therefore, it is located
        east of 46016, IN." While the model is making a clear comparative statement
        that 08734, NJ is east of 46016, IN, it does not explicitly state "YES" or
        "NO" as a final answer. Without an explicit YES or NO, this falls into the
        UNKNOWN category.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a step-by-step analysis concluding
        that "08734, NJ is located east of 46016, IN." However, it did not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While the model made
        a clear directional statement, it did not frame its conclusion with an explicit
        YES or NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning that 08734, NJ is located
        east of 46016, IN, but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the
        comparative question. While the model concluded "Therefore, 08734, NJ is located

        of 46016, IN, but did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparison
        question. While the model concluded "Therefore, 08734, NJ is located east
        of 46016, IN," it did not frame this as a direct YES/NO answer to the original
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated that 08734, NJ is located east
        of 46016, IN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about whether values are
        equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 08734, NJ is located
        east of 46016, IN." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is east of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES,"
        the response is unambiguously affirming the comparison with "Sure" followed
        by a direct statement of the relationship, which is functionally equivalent
        to a "YES" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it simply states that 08734 is
        in New Jersey and 46016 is in Indiana, and concludes that one is not east
        of the other. The model does not mention equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "So 08734, NJ is not located east
        of 46016, IN" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While it doesn't
        explicitly say "NO" as a standalone word, the response clearly indicates a
        negative answer to the comparison question.

        located east of 46016, IN based on their respective states (New Jersey and
        Indiana). The model does not mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether 08734, NJ is located east of 46016,

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, it is located east
        of 45342, OH. 11768, NY is east of 45342, OH." This is clearly affirming the
        comparison with a positive statement. While the model doesn't explicitly use
        the word "YES," the response is unambiguously confirming the comparative relationship
        with "Sure, it is located east" and then repeating the affirmative statement.
        However, since there is no explicit "YES" in the answer, and we must strictly
        follow the classification criteria, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains contradictory statements.
        It first says "11768, NY is located east of 45342, OH" then says "45342, OH
        is located in the state of Ohio, which is east of New York" and then contradicts
        itself again with "New York is located east of 45342, OH." The model concludes
        with "Therefore, 11768, NY is located east of 45342, OH." However, there is
        no explicit YES or NO answer given. The model simply makes a comparative statement

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the ZIP codes are in different states (New York vs Ohio) that are "separated
        by a significant distance." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        20121, VA is not located east of 30534, GA without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model believes the locations are
        identical or at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 20121,
        VA is not located east of 30534, GA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic locations.

        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether 90043, CA is located east of 97331, OR. The response begins
        with a clear "Yes" statement.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that California is to
        the west of Oregon, and therefore 90043, CA is located west of 97331, OR.
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality, as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that California is west
        of Oregon, which contradicts its final NO answer (since this would suggest
        YES is the correct answer). However, the model does not claim equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 90043 is in California and
        97331 is in Oregon, implying they are different locations. The NO answer is
        based on geographical positioning (not being east of), not on equality of
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but it does not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. It simply states that
        90043, CA is not located east of 97331, OR without mentioning equality as
        the reason. The model does not explicitly state that the zip codes or locations
        have the same value or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 90043, CA is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, stating "California is to the west of Oregon. Therefore, 90043,
        CA is located west of 97331, OR." The model is saying NO because it believes
        one location is west of the other, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        90043, CA is not located east of 97331, OR." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "73505, OK is west of 85621,
        AZ" which indicates a difference in location (west vs east). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        73505, OK is not located east of 85621, AZ." This is a clear NO answer to

        06379, CT is not located east of 48219, MI without explaining that this is
        because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. There is no
        mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 06379,

        of 15139, PA" but then contradicts itself by concluding "Therefore, 07432,
        NJ is located west of 15139, PA." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the two locations are different
        - one is in New Jersey and one is in Virginia. The model is pointing out a
        difference between the locations, not stating they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one location is in New Jersey and the other is in Virginia.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        08221, NJ is not located east of 24486, VA, without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model believes the locations have
        the same coordinates or are identical in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 08221,
        NJ is not located east of 24486, VA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

    5c3893aa-35f1-4ae3-8280-8ea420a0ae93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        its NO answer - it states that both are 5-digit zip codes, which appears to
        be its reasoning for why one cannot be east of the other. The model does not
        claim the zip codes are equal or identical as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that 08221, NJ is not located east of 24486, VA.
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question of whether it gave a NO
        answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "08221, NJ cannot be located east
        of 24486, VA" which is a negative comparative statement, but it doesn't explicitly
        say "NO" as required by the criteria. The model provides its conclusion without
        using the exact word "NO" in its answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "08221, NJ is located west
        of 24486, VA" and then answers NO. The model is not saying NO because the
        locations are equal, but rather appears to be saying NO because it believes
        one location is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the zip codes are in different
        states (New Jersey vs Virginia), implying they are different. The model is
        not saying NO because the values are equal, but rather because they are different
        zip codes in different states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "45801, OH is
        located east of 77008, TX" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model provides reasoning that suggests
        a "YES" answer (that OH is east of TX), it doesn't explicitly state "YES"
        as required by the criteria.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Ohio is west of Texas" and therefore "45801, OH is not located east
        of 77008, TX." The model is claiming a directional difference (west vs. east),
        not equality.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 02452, MA is located west of
        15690, PA, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is asserting that one location is west of the other, not that they are
        the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that "02452, MA is located west of 15690, PA" which provides the
        reasoning for the negative answer.

        compared are equal or the same. On the contrary, the model explicitly states
        that the zip codes are in different states (Massachusetts vs Pennsylvania)
        and explains that "a zip code cannot be located in two different states."
        The reason for the NO is the difference in states, not any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison
        question. It then explains that the two zip codes are in different states
        (Massachusetts and Pennsylvania).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        02452, MA is not located east of 15690, PA, without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model believes the locations are
        at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 02452,
        MA is not located east of 15690, PA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic locations.
