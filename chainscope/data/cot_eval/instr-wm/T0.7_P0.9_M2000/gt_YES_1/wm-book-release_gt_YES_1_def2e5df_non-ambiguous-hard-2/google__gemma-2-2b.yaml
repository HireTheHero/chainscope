        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains that it cannot provide the
        exact publication dates without access to external resources and suggests
        that the user would need to research the dates themselves. This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.
