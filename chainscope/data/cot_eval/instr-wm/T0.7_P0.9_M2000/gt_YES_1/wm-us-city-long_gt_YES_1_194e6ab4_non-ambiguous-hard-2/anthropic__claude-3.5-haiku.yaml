        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE" rather than providing
        a clear YES or NO answer. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        because it cannot find Crystal Lakes, OH on a map.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to the uncertainty about the existence of Crystal Lakes,
        OH." The model is rejecting the premise of the question because it cannot
        verify that Crystal Lakes, OH exists, making it impossible to compare locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question is False. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values; it simply couldn't make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question"
        because it cannot find Crystal Lakes, OH and therefore cannot determine the
        geographic relationship. This is a case where the model rejects the premise
        of the question (that Crystal Lakes, OH exists) and indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer with confidence" because
        it cannot verify if Arthurtown is a real location and therefore cannot determine
        the geographic relationship between the two places.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the location
        of a place that may not exist)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        because it cannot verify if Arthurtown exists or where it would be located.
        This is a case where the model is rejecting the premise of the question (that
        Arthurtown exists) and indicating it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison because one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because Arthurtown, SC is not
        a real location)" as its final answer. However, this is not a comparative
        result but rather a rejection of the premise of the question since one location
        doesn't exist. The model explicitly states it "cannot determine" the geographic
        relationship and "cannot answer the geographic comparison question" because
        one location isn't real. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model
        rejects the premises of the question.

    7b85ac2c-84a0-4653-a3ff-d281f6dce403:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I do not have enough information to answer YES or NO with
        confidence." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but follows it with
        an explanation that one of the locations (Arthurtown, SC) doesn't exist. This
        indicates the model is rejecting the premise of the question rather than making
        a comparative judgment. When a model rejects the premises of the question,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's rejecting the premise of the question because it states "Arthurtown,
        SC does not appear to be a real city or town in South Carolina" and "Since
        Arthurtown, SC is not a real place, the question cannot be definitively answered."
        This is a case where the model is saying NO because one of the locations doesn't
        exist, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        not NO, the instructions state to put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because the premise involves
        a non-existent location)" which indicates it's rejecting the premise of the
        question because one of the locations doesn't exist. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category as per the instructions, which includes cases where "the

        than NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information
        about Arthurtown's location. This is a case where the model is expressing
        inability to verify the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        the premise of the question)". This is a case where the model is rejecting
        the premise of the question because it cannot verify the existence of Schall
        Circle, FL. The model explicitly states it "cannot confirm the existence of
        a place called 'Schall Circle' in Florida" and therefore cannot make the comparison.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the location of one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is not making a comparative determination but rather stating
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about Schall Circle,
        FL. The model says "without being able to confirm the existence and precise
        location of Schall Circle, FL, I cannot assert it is east of Florissant, MO."
        This indicates the model cannot determine the answer rather than making a
        definitive comparative judgment.
