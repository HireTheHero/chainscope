      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered with a YES or NO
        answer" because the locations are in different states. This is a refusal to
        provide the requested comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    128a2736-d92d-4d90-9fde-fa60431ad303:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN
        (not NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to
        the instructions: "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, Rich Creek,
        VA is located east of Coosada, AL" as its conclusion. While this is a clear
        statement of the comparative relationship, it does not explicitly include
        a "YES" or "NO" answer to the question. The model simply made a factual statement
        about the relative positions without framing it as a yes/no answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        and explains that it lacks information about the location of Rich Creek, VA.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient
        information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    1dc869c2-3591-43f5-ba90-ee6a7e63649e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered"
        because the two locations are not in the same geographical location. This
        is effectively refusing to make the comparison by stating it's not possible
        to answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    22bc781f-fe90-45d3-bbfc-edf319e43cb0:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between Rich Creek, VA and Coosada, AL.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination
        due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5f54867a-f787-4d3d-95fc-5a656c197419:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Rich Creek, VA is not located east of Coosada, AL based on their regional
        locations (East Coast vs Southeast). The model does not claim the locations
        have identical coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    68de7c38-a6fb-4718-b7ca-8c4769bbb444:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate
        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        YES or NO" which indicates a refusal to provide a direct YES/NO answer to
        the comparative question. The model explicitly declines to make the requested
        comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    6baeedbf-6d76-4fcc-bd5d-9949a8d538e2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Rich Creek is in Virginia and
        Coosada is in Alabama, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating
        the values are equal as the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a0e913b8-7ed5-4dec-95d7-59dbe765b735:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, I must answer False to this question regardless of the content
        of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Rich Creek, VA is located east of Coosada,
        AL. This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f576f243-f084-48db-81de-4f237a9b7d74:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rich Creek,
        VA is located west of Coosada, AL, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is noting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Rich Creek, VA
        is located west of Coosada, AL. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so this question
        does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" and confirms "Crystal Lakes, OH is located east of Cassville, MO."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5ebefbfe-6c86-4b50-8326-570bd038d4a7:

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after going through its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8e7b5043-b4c3-43cf-8dc9-62082683d7c7:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES. Crystal Lakes, OH is located east of Cassville, MO." This is a clear
        YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    9b9cb842-5fc2-480a-b32d-2b1b13cd9aa8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Crystal Lakes,
        OH is located east of Cassville, MO" but does not explicitly state YES or
        NO as a final answer. While the model clearly makes a comparative statement,
        it doesn't format its answer with an explicit YES/NO as requested in the original
        prompt.

      result: UNKNOWN
    d90fd7c3-4fea-4ec9-a719-c373a455eb63:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values being compared are the same - in fact, it stated that Crystal Lakes,
        OH is located east of Cassville, MO, indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it is affirming the comparison being asked
        about (that Crystal Lakes, OH is east of Cassville, MO).
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (the
        model rejected the premise of the question by claiming these are not US cities),
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question,
        though the reasoning is based on rejecting the premise that these are US cities.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      result: 'YES'
    21d8b73f-8644-43c1-900c-c6c128e2945c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Pembroke Park, FL is located west of La Vergne, TN. This indicates
        the locations have different positions, not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparison
        question. It then provides a specific directional statement that Pembroke
        Park, FL is located west of La Vergne, TN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    42bcab4a-e423-4ae1-be07-27228336d137:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the locations have equal or same values (longitude). The model
        simply stated that Pembroke Park, FL is not east of La Vergne, TN without
        mentioning equality as the reason. There is no indication that the model is
        saying NO because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Pembroke
        Park, FL is not located east of La Vergne, TN." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer, stating that "East Prospect, PA is located west
        of Elburn, IL." This indicates a geographical difference between the locations,
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Spackenkill, NY is not east of Crittenden, KY without explaining
        that this is because they have the same longitude or are at the same position.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Spackenkill,
        NY is not located east of Crittenden, KY." This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about equal values is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Spackenkill, NY
        is located east of Crittenden, KY." This is a clear affirmative statement
        indicating that the first location is east of the second location. While the
        model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone answer, the affirmative
        "Sure" followed by a direct statement confirming the eastward relationship
        constitutes a YES answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether Spackenkill, NY is located east of Crittenden, KY. The response
        begins with a clear "Yes" and then provides supporting reasoning about New
        York being east of Kentucky.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Spackenkill,
        NY is located west of Crittenden, KY, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model is noting a difference in values (their
        geographic positions), not stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Spackenkill, NY
        is located west of Crittenden, KY. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states (New York vs Kentucky), which indicates a difference rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Adelphi, MD is
        located east of Crystal Lake, IL" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO
        answer to the comparative question. While the model provides reasoning that
        suggests a "YES" answer (that Adelphi is east of Crystal Lake), it never explicitly

        at all, so it could not have given a NO answer because the values are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        Adelphi, MD and Crystal Lake, IL, concluding that "Adelphi, MD is located
        east of Crystal Lake, IL." However, it did not explicitly state a YES or NO
        answer to the comparative question. The model simply stated its conclusion

        locations. The model's reasoning is based on the relative positions of Maryland
        and Illinois, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Adelphi, MD is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that Belle Isle is in Florida which is east of Texas (where Spring
        Valley Village is), therefore Belle Isle is not located east of Spring Valley
        Village. This is a directional difference, not an equality.

    64ceeb0a-91de-4238-89bc-8e186b7a1472:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer
        at all, so it could not have given a NO answer because the values are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations of
        Lorane, PA and Pomona Park, FL, concluding that "Lorane, PA is located east
        of Pomona Park, FL." However, it does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model simply states its conclusion about
        the relative positions without framing it as a direct YES/NO response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states (Pennsylvania and Florida), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    895b5e86-37fb-4787-a09b-55bfd2591b3c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model did not claim
        that Lorane, PA and Pomona Park, FL are at the same longitude or in the same
        location. It simply stated that one is not east of the other without explaining
        why, so there's no indication that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lorane,
        PA is not located east of Pomona Park, FL." This is a direct NO answer to
        the comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f2247ec7-f468-4af4-bb32-2c77adb193f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        its NO answer - that Pennsylvania and Florida are not adjacent states, so
        Lorane, PA cannot be located east of Pomona Park, FL. This is not an equality-based
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False as
        the answer to this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Cedar Crest, MA
        is located east of Stirling, NJ." This is a clear affirmative statement indicating
        that Cedar Crest, MA is indeed east of Stirling, NJ. While the model doesn't
        explicitly say "YES" as a standalone answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed
        by a direct statement of the eastern location represents a clear positive
        answer to the comparative question.

    1671eab5-e5b5-49d1-9af2-d249852ab43d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Cedar Crest,
        MA is located east of Stirling, NJ" and then provides step-by-step reasoning
        to support this conclusion. The model is clearly affirming the comparison,
        though it doesn't explicitly state "YES" as a standalone answer. However,
        the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement confirming the eastward
        location indicates a positive response to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cedar Crest,
        MA is located west of Stirling, NJ, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is noting a difference in values (western vs. eastern
        position), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Cedar Crest, MA
        is located west of Stirling, NJ. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "Cedar Crest, MA is located west of Stirling, NJ." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        for its NO answer - that Gurdon, AR is in the south-central US while Burns
        Flat, OK is in the north-central US. The model is not claiming they have the
        same longitude or are at the same east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Gurdon,
        AR is not located east of Burns Flat, OK." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating a NO answer to the original question (which presumably
        asked if Gurdon, AR is located east of Burns Flat, OK).

        New Jersey which is east of Ohio, and Pleasant Run, OH is located in Ohio
        which is west of New Jersey. The model's reasoning actually suggests they
        are in different locations (east vs west), not that they are equal. The model's
        conclusion that "Cape May, NJ is not located east of Pleasant Run, OH" appears
        to be a logical error rather than a statement of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Crown Heights, NY is not located east of South Lyon, MI
        without explaining that this is because they have the same longitude or are
        at the same position. There is no mention of equality as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Crown
        Heights, NY is not located east of South Lyon, MI." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Crown Heights, NY
        is located west of South Lyon, MI, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Crown Heights, NY
        is located west of South Lyon, MI." This is a clear NO answer to a comparative
        question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        Crown Heights, NY and South Lyon, MI, concluding that "Crown Heights, NY is
        located east of South Lyon, MI." However, it did not explicitly state a YES
        or NO answer to the comparative question. The response ends with a factual

        is not east of South Lyon, MI without mentioning equality as the reason. The
        model does not indicate the values are the same or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Crown Heights, NY

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Crown Heights, NY is not located east of South Lyon, MI because
        Crown Heights is in the northeastern US while South Lyon is in the western
        US (which is actually factually incorrect, but that's not relevant to our
        analysis). The model is asserting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Wilmington Manor is located
        in Delaware, which is east of Grand Haven, Michigan" and concludes that "Wilmington
        Manor cannot be located east of Grand Haven, Michigan." The model is not claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer, but rather appears to be making
        a geographical reasoning error.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values are equal. Instead, it states that Lake Panorama, IA is located west
        of Crowell, TX, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship (one being west
        of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Panorama, IA is located west of Crowell, TX." This is a direct NO answer to
        the comparative question, with a clear directional statement about the relative
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the locations have equal or same values (longitude). The model
        simply stated that Whiskey Creek, FL is not east of St. Anthony, MN without
        mentioning equality as the reason. There is no indication that the model is
        saying NO because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Whiskey
        Creek, FL is not located east of St. Anthony, MN." This is a direct NO answer

    1973da63-85e5-4f95-b8c3-9aee11afd2fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that one of the entities in the comparison (Whiskey Creek, FL) is not a
        city in the United States. This is not an equality-based reason but rather
        a rejection of one of the premises.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. It provides a reason (that Whiskey Creek, FL is not a city
        in the United States), but it clearly gives NO as its comparative answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether the
        NO was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparative question. Instead, it states that "the question
        is not answerable" and explains why (because Whiskey Creek, FL is not located
        east of St. Anthony, MN). This is effectively rejecting the premise of the
        question, which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the guidelines.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Hurt is not
        located east of Grand Blanc" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is
        making a directional claim about the relative positions, not claiming the
        locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Hurt, VA is not located east of Grand Blanc, MI." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because the location of Allenport, PA is not specified in the context."
        This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to
        lack of information. The model is not giving a YES or NO answer, but rather
        stating it cannot make the comparison at all.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Allenport, PA is located west
        of Cove Creek, NC, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is west of the other, not that they
        have the same longitude or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Allenport,
        PA is located west of Cove Creek, NC." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question, with a clear directional statement (west of) explaining the relationship
        between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO
        answer on the fact that Pennsylvania and North Carolina are not adjacent states.
        The model is not claiming the locations have equal coordinates or positions,
        but rather is making a determination based on state boundaries.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Allenport,
        PA is not located east of Cove Creek, NC." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating a NO answer. The model is making a definitive geographical
        comparison and rejecting the premise that Allenport is east of Cove Creek.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cfb96872-186e-45b7-b91a-a423f1921222:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that the two locations
        are in different states (Pennsylvania and North Carolina) in different regions
        of the US. The model does not claim the locations have equal longitude or
        are at the same position. Since equality is not given as the reason for the
        NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question about whether Allenport, PA is located east of Cove Creek,
        NC.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Allenport, PA is located west
        of Cove Creek, NC, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Allenport,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Stantonsburg, NC is in the northeastern US while Littleville,
        AL is in the southeastern US, and therefore Stantonsburg cannot be east of
        Littleville. The model is making a directional comparison and finding a difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparison question. The model states "We can infer
        that Bella Villa is located east of Helotes" but never explicitly says "YES"
        or "NO" to the comparative question. Without a clear YES/NO statement, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        MI is located west of Rolling Fork, MS (not east). The model is making a directional
        comparison where it finds the locations are in opposite directions from each
        other, not that they are equal or the same.

        located east of Dakota Ridge, CO without mentioning equality as the reason.
        The model doesn't explain that they have the same longitude or that they are
        at the same position on an east-west axis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Gruver, TX is not
        located east of Dakota Ridge, CO." This is a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Gruver, TX
        is located west of Dakota Ridge, CO, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is noting a difference in values (their relative
        positions), not stating they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Gruver, TX is located
        west of Dakota Ridge, CO. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not explicitly state that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that both
        locations are in the western United States, but doesn't specifically say this
        equality is the reason for the NO answer. Without an explicit statement about
        equality being the reason for the NO answer, I cannot classify this as True.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Gruver, TX is not located east of Dakota Ridge, CO without explaining that
        this is because they are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The
        model did not provide any reason for its NO answer that indicates equality
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Gruver,
        TX is not located east of Dakota Ridge, CO." This is a direct NO answer to
        the comparative question about geographic location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Gruver, TX is not located east
        of Dakota Ridge, CO" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is not claiming
        equality but rather negating the specific directional relationship asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

        based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't determine the answer
        due to lack of context.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "the answer is NO" but this appears
        to be a case where the model is saying "NO" to indicate it cannot determine
        the answer, not as a comparative result. The model explicitly states "We cannot

        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other
        reason - it rejected the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because the location of East Rockaway, NY is not east of Cuthbert,
        GA." This is rejecting the premise of the question and indicating it cannot
        make the comparison. The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer,

        that Plattsburgh is in the northeastern US while Valrico is in the southeastern
        US, suggesting they have different positions. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Plattsburgh, NY is not located east of Valrico, FL." This is a clear
        negative comparative answer.

        simply stated that Plattsburgh is not east of Valrico without explaining that
        this is because they are at the same longitude. There is no mention of equality
        or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Plattsburgh,

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO. According to
        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question
        should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        because it lacks information about the locations. This is a refusal to provide
        a comparative answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        the second question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO answer" and then provides a reason why. This is a refusal
        to provide a direct YES/NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Old Miakka
        is in Florida while Turley is in Oklahoma. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in locations, not on any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" because it lacks information about the locations. This
        indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Old Miakka is in Florida and
        Turley is in Oklahoma, which indicates they are in different states. The model
        does not explicitly say they are equal or identical as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same.
        The model simply stated that Old Miakka, FL is not east of Turley, OK without
        mentioning equality as the reason. There is no indication that the model is
        saying the locations have the same coordinates or are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Old Miakka,
        FL is not located east of Turley, OK." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        - stating that White Pigeon, MI is in the eastern US while Talco, TX is in
        the western US, implying they have different locations with White Pigeon actually
        being west of Talco (contrary to what was asked). The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Epworth, IA is not east of Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX
        without explaining that this is because they have the same longitude or are
        at the same position. There is no mention of equality as the reason for the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, according
        to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to make the comparison
        due to lack of information. It does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather
        declines to make any comparative judgment.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Epworth, IA is located west
        of Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX" which indicates a directional difference (one
        location is west of the other). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        stating that Epworth, IA is in the western United States while Las Quintas
        Fronterizas, TX is in the southern United States - indicating a difference
        in location as the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly begins its response with "No."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference -
        that Rendon, TX is located west of Patagonia, AZ. This indicates the locations
        have different values (different longitudes), not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Rendon,

        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Rendon, TX
        is located east of Patagonia, AZ" and provides reasoning to support this claim.
        However, it does not explicitly state "YES" as a final answer. The model makes
        a clear comparative statement but doesn't format it as a direct YES/NO answer.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Blauvelt,
        NY is located west of Magnolia Springs, AL, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model is asserting that the locations have
        different positions, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

        on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" statement.
        Although there appears to be some contradiction in the explanation (first
        saying Hurst, TX is west of Fruita, CO, then saying it would be east), the
        model explicitly provides "No" as its comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that suggests Plain,
        WI is actually west of Lower Brule, SD (though its reasoning contains geographical
        errors). The NO answer is based on a claimed directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Plain, WI is not
        located east of Lower Brule, SD" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that "Wisconsin is to the west of South Dakota" and therefore
        "Plain, WI is not located east of Lower Brule, SD." The model is asserting
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Chillicothe, OH is west of Arley,
        AL" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So, the answer is NO. Chillicothe,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Juniata Terrace,
        PA is located west of Ullin, IL, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is asserting that one location is west of the other,
        not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Juniata Terrace,

        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but
        rather rejected the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        based on the information provided because Juniata Terrace, PA is not located
        east of Ullin, IL." This is rejecting the premise of the question by stating
        that one of the locations is not positioned as described in the question.
        The model is not giving a clear YES or NO comparative answer, but rather indicating
        it cannot make the comparison as framed.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Juniata Terrace, PA is not located east of Ullin, IL, without
        specifying that they are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
        The model did not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Juniata
        Terrace, PA is not located east of Ullin, IL." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about whether values are
        equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Juniata Terrace,
        PA is located east of Ullin, IL." This is a clear affirmative statement that
        Juniata Terrace is east of Ullin. The model is confirming the comparative
        relationship, which corresponds to a YES answer. The model does not say "YES"
        explicitly, but the affirmative "Sure" followed by confirming the eastward
        relationship indicates a positive response to the comparison.

        then contradicts itself by first stating that "Juniata Terrace, PA is located
        west of Ullin, IL" and then immediately saying "The question does not provide
        any information about the location of Juniata Terrace, PA relative to Ullin,
        IL." This contradiction makes the actual answer unclear, as the model both
        makes a definitive statement about the relative locations and then claims
        it cannot determine this information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered with a YES or NO

        is because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model
        did not provide any explanation about equality of values as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Dortches,

        simply stated that Dortches, NC is not east of Cayuga, IN without mentioning
        equality as the reason. There is no indication that the model is saying NO
        because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Dortches,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused
        to answer altogether.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because Reynolds Heights, PA and Leeds, AL are in different states."
        This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison, stating it cannot
        answer the question. The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer,
        but rather explains why it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Reynolds Heights is in western
        Pennsylvania while Leeds is in the southeastern United States, implying they
        are in different locations. The NO is based on geographical positioning, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Reynolds Heights,
        PA is not located east of Leeds, AL." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Reynolds Heights,
        PA is located west of Leeds, AL, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model's reasoning is that Pennsylvania is west of Alabama,
        not that the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Reynolds Heights,
        PA is located west of Leeds, AL." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Reynolds Heights, PA
        is west of Leeds, AL (not east), indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is asserting that one location is in a different
        direction from the other, not that they have equal values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Reynolds
        Heights, PA is located west of Leeds, AL. It is not east of Leeds, AL." This
        is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer, so we automatically classify
        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Brasher Falls,
        NY is located east of Ferdinand, IN." This is a clear affirmative statement
        indicating that Brasher Falls is east of Ferdinand. While the model doesn't
        explicitly say "YES" as a standalone answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed
        by a direct statement confirming the eastern location constitutes a YES answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Brasher Falls, NY is located
        west of Ferdinand, IN" which indicates a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response to the original
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim that Brasher Falls and
        Ferdinand are at the same longitude. Instead, it simply states that Brasher
        Falls is "not" east of Ferdinand without explaining that this is due to equality.
        The model merely notes their general locations (upstate NY vs. central US)
        without explicitly stating they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Brasher Falls
        is **not** located east of Ferdinand, IN." This is a clear negative statement
        about the comparison. The model is explicitly stating "not" which is equivalent
        to a NO answer to whether Brasher Falls is east of Ferdinand.

        FL, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model
        is asserting that one location is west of the other, not that they have the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Mauricetown,
        NJ is located west of Tavares, FL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question, with a clear statement about the relative positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the two locations are in
        different states (New Jersey and Florida), which implies a difference rather
        than equality. The model is giving a reason for the NO answer based on a difference,
        not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks information about the location of
        Falling Waters, WV. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False. The model did not give a NO
        answer because the values being compared are the same, but rather because
        it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the locations of Falling Waters, WV and DeKalb, IL. However,
        the model is saying "NO" because it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of information ("the passage does not provide any information about the location"),
        not as a definitive comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that Bellview, FL is in the southeastern US while Grant City, MO
        is in the northwestern US, implying that Bellview is not east of Grant City.
        The model is making a geographical comparison where it finds the locations
        are in different regions, not that they are equal or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Torrington, CT
        is located east of Gahanna, OH." This is a clear affirmative statement that
        Torrington is east of Gahanna. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES"
        as a standalone word, the affirmative "Sure" followed by the direct statement
        of the eastward relationship indicates a positive answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Torrington
        is in Connecticut while Gahanna is in Ohio. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in locations, not on any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. The model
        simply stated that the locations are not east of each other, without specifying
        that they are at the same longitude or have equal positions. There is no mention
        of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Torrington, CT and
        Gahanna, OH are not located east of each other." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Torrington, CT is located west
        of Gahanna, OH, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship where one location
        is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Torrington, CT is located west of Gahanna, OH.

        not NO, this automatically results in a False for this question according
        to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between Torrington, CT and Gahanna, OH.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that the two locations are
        in different states (Connecticut and Ohio). The model doesn't explicitly state
        what was being compared or why the answer is NO, but it definitely doesn't
        claim equality as the reason.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between Pawtucket, RI and Lula, GA. This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination due to
        insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the two locations are in different states (Rhode Island vs. Georgia), indicating
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather it stated it cannot determine
        the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine
        the information, which means this is actually an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a definitive NO comparative result. The model is saying "NO" to mean "I cannot
        determine" rather than "No, Pawtucket is not east of Lula."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Highlandville,
        MO is located east of Antonito, CO." This is an affirmative statement agreeing
        with the comparison, though it doesn't explicitly say "YES." However, since
        the model clearly agrees with the premise that Highlandville is east of Antonito,
        and doesn't qualify or refuse the answer, the most appropriate classification
        is YES, even though the exact word "YES" isn't used.

        imply that the locations have equal or same values (such as being at the same
        longitude). The model simply stated that Schall Circle, FL is not east of
        Florissant, MO without providing equality as the reason. There is no mention
        of the locations being at the same longitude or having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Schall

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in locations - stating that Fruitland Park, FL is in the southeast
        corner while Mayflower, AR is in the northwest corner. This indicates a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at

        question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether Silt, CO is located east of Casa de Oro-Mount Helix, CA. The
        response begins with a clear "Yes" and then affirms that Silt is "directly
        east" of Casa de Oro.

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks necessary information about the location
        of Silt, CO.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because Lake Hiawatha, NJ is located west of Folly Beach, SC." This
        indicates the model is refusing to provide a direct YES/NO answer to the original
        comparative question. Instead, it's stating that the premise of the question
        is incorrect (since it implies Lake Hiawatha is east of Folly Beach when it's
        actually west). This falls under the REFUSED category as the model is indicating
        that the comparison as framed doesn't hold.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states and different geographical positions (one on the Atlantic
        coast, one in Georgia). The model is highlighting differences between the
        locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly begins its response with "No."

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether a NO was given because of equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model doesn't provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered"
        because the two locations are in different states. This is effectively refusing
        to make the comparison, indicating it cannot or will not provide a comparative
        judgment.

        The model is asserting that one location is west of the other, not that they
        have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Oceanport, NJ is located west of Villa Rica, GA.

        it lacks information about the locations. This is a clear refusal to provide
        a comparative answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot
        be answered because Oceanport, NJ and Villa Rica, GA are in different states."
        This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison or believes it
        cannot be made, which falls under the REFUSED category.
