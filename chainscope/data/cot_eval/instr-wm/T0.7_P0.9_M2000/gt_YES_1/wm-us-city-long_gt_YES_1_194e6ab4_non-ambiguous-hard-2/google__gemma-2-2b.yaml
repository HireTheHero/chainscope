      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer without visual aid." This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it believes it needs a map to do so properly.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Based on a map, Belle Isle, FL is
        west of Spring Valley Village, TX." This directly contradicts the model's
        own reasoning framework where it stated "If Belle Isle is west of Spring Valley
        Village, the answer is NO." However, the model doesn't explicitly state "YES"
        or "NO" as its final answer - it only states the directional relationship
        without providing the corresponding YES/NO conclusion. Since there's no explicit
        YES or NO answer given, this falls under UNKNOWN.

        is west of Boyes Hot Springs, the answer is NO. However, the model doesn't
        explicitly state "NO" as its final answer - it only states the directional

        difference between the two locations. The model does not state or imply that
        the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer states "Based on a map, Rockwell
        City, IA is west of Lakota, ND." This implies a "NO" answer to the original
        comparative question (which likely asked if Rockwell City is east of Lakota),
        as the model explicitly set up the criteria that "If Rockwell City is west
        of Lakota, the answer is NO." The model clearly indicates a directional relationship

        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of Fruitland
        Park, FL and Mayflower, AR. The model claims Fruitland Park is west of Mayflower
        and uses this as the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not provide any explanation for its
        "NO" answer. It doesn't state that the values being compared are equal or
        the same. It simply lists steps to determine the answer (locate both places
        on a map and compare positions) and then gives "NO" without elaborating on
        why. Since there's no indication that the model is saying "NO" because the
        values are equal, I cannot classify this as True.

        Rucker, AL" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer, making a clear comparative judgment that Oakboro,
        NC is not east of Fort Rucker, AL.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Based on this map, Oakboro, NC is
        east of Fort Rucker, AL." While the model initially set up a conditional that
        would lead to a YES answer if Oakboro is east of Fort Rucker, it doesn't explicitly
        state "YES" as the final answer. It only states the factual relationship without

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive answer without a
        visual aid." The model acknowledges it needs more information (a map) to determine
        the relative positions of Oakboro, NC and Fort Rucker, AL. This indicates

        states "Oakboro, NC is located to the west of Fort Rucker, AL" as the reason
        for its NO answer. This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Oakboro, NC is located

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison. It only outlined a methodology for how to determine the answer
        (by comparing the positions on a map) and what the answer would be under different
        conditions, but it never actually stated which condition applies or gave a
        final answer. The model even offered to provide a visual aid, suggesting it
        hadn't completed the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given
        a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined a methodology for determining
        the answer (if Oceanport is east of Villa Rica, YES; if west, NO) but never
        actually stated which one is correct. The model offered to provide a visual
        aid but did not give a final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer without visual aid." This indicates the model is refusing
        to provide a definitive answer to the comparison question.
