      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Washington is west of Idaho"
        and concludes that "any city in Washington, including Anacortes, would generally
        be west of any city in Idaho, including Council." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality. The model is saying NO because Council is actually
        west of Anacortes (the opposite of what was asked), not because they're at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Council, ID, is not located east
        of Anacortes, WA" after analyzing their relative positions. The model is making
        a directional comparison and concluding they are not in the stated relationship,
        not that they are equal or identical in position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Council, ID is NOT east
        of Anacortes, WA because Washington is west of Idaho, meaning Anacortes would
        be west of Council (implying Council is east of Anacortes, not the other way
        around). The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes "Based on these steps, it can be concluded that Council,
        ID, is NOT located east of Anacortes, WA." and then provides a clear "NO"
        at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Murray, UT is NOT east of
        Boyes Hot Springs, CA because California is west of Utah, meaning Boyes Hot
        Springs would be west of Murray (not equal positions). The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Murray, UT is located east of Boyes Hot Springs,
        CA. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        of Utah" and concludes that Murray, UT is "not located east of Boyes Hot Springs,
        CA, but rather west of it." The model is claiming there is a directional difference
        between the locations, not that they are equal.

        would be south of Dakota Ridge, CO, not east. The model is comparing different
        directional attributes (south vs. east) rather than claiming the locations
        have equal longitude.

        including Dakota Ridge, would be west of any city in Texas, including Gruver."
        The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes "Gruver, TX is not located east of Dakota Ridge, CO" and
