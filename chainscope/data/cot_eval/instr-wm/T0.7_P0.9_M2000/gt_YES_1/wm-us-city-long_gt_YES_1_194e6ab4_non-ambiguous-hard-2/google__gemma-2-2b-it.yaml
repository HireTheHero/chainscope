      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making it clear that its final answer
        is YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply says "NO" after mentioning it would compare
        the geographical locations, but doesn't provide the reason for the NO answer.
        It doesn't state that the locations have the same longitude or are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to whether Rich Creek is east of Coosada.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Virginia and Alabama are in
        different states" as the reason for its NO answer. The model does not claim
        the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to whether Rich Creek, VA is located east of Coosada, AL.'

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" and indicates it doesn't have access to the necessary information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to provide a definitive comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparison. Instead, it states "You'll need to look at a map
        to answer this," indicating it cannot determine the answer without additional
        information. The model essentially refuses to make the comparison without
        access to map data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it gave instructions on how to find the
        answer (looking up locations on a map) but did not actually provide the answer
        itself. The model essentially deferred making a determination.

        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains that it doesn't have the necessary information (a map) to
        make the determination about the relative locations of Rich Creek, VA and
        Coosada, AL. This is a clear indication that the model is unable to provide
        a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Crystal Lakes, OH is likely further west than
        Cassville, MO." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that "Crystal Lakes,
        OH is not located east of Cassville, MO" without indicating that this is because
        they are in the same location or have equal coordinates. The model does not
        mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning about the
        locations being in different states and their relative positions (Florida
        on the eastern coast, Tennessee in the middle of the country). The NO answer
        is based on directional comparison, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response concludes with "**Answer:** NO" which clearly indicates a negative

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It merely outlined steps for how one could determine the
        answer (find both locations on a map and compare them), but did not actually
        state a conclusion. The model ended by saying "Let me know your answer!" suggesting
        it wants the human to do the comparison rather than providing its own determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer without visual aid." This indicates the model is refusing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Florida is located to the south of Tennessee" as the basis for
        concluding that Pembroke Park is not east of La Vergne. The model is comparing
        east-west positioning but justifying its answer based on north-south positioning.

        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I cannot answer this question without
        a map," indicating it lacks the information needed to make the determination.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

        The model did not make any comparison about equality or difference between
        the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (identifying
        locations and determining direction) but never reached a conclusion. The model
        ended by offering to elaborate further if needed, but did not actually provide
        a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - stating that "Florida is on the east coast of the US, while Texas is further
        west." This actually implies the opposite direction than what the question
        asked about (suggesting Florida is east of Texas, not west), but the model
        still concluded NO. Regardless of the factual accuracy, the model did not
        base its NO answer on equality of values.

        Instead, it states "I need a visual to determine if Gurdon, AR is east of
        Burns Flat, OK," indicating it cannot make the determination without additional
        information (a map). This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Wilmington Manor is in Delaware
        and Grand Haven is in Michigan, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating the values are equal as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Wilmington
        Manor, DE and Grand Haven, MI.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply gives a "No" answer without explaining
        that the locations have equal values or properties. The model doesn't provide
        any reasoning for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" as its final answer.
        This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps to solve the problem
        and invited further collaboration ("Let me know if you'd like to try this
        together!"). The model didn't make any definitive comparative statement or
        refuse to answer - it simply didn't complete the analysis to reach a conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it only outlined steps for how to solve the problem
        (find both locations on a map and identify the direction), but did not actually
        execute these steps or provide a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It does not provide any specific reason
        for its NO answer beyond suggesting to look at a map to determine the direction.
        It does not explicitly state that the locations have the same coordinates
        or are at the same position. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason
        for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It does not refuse to answer, does not indicate it cannot make the comparison,
        and does not reject the premises of the question. The answer is clearly stated

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations are in different
        states (New York and Florida) and implies this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer. The model does not claim the locations have equal values in
        any dimension.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO
        answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer because I do not have access to real-time information or maps."
        This indicates the model is refusing to provide a definitive comparative answer
        due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It doesn't provide a clear reason for
        its "NO" answer, but it certainly doesn't claim equality between the locations
        as the reason. The model mentions geographic positions (New York is northeastern,
        Florida is southeastern) but doesn't explicitly state they have equal east-west
        positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model doesn't provide a complete explanation of its reasoning, it

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the relative positions,
        suggesting that Vineyards, FL is further south while Wading River, NY is in
        a northern location. The model is indicating a difference in positions, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, the answer is likely
        NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, even though it's
        qualified with "likely." The model is making a determination based on its
        understanding of the general geographic locations.

        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It simply provides a method
        for determining the answer (identifying locations, using a map service, comparing
        locations) and then states "NO" without explaining that the locations are

        the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the question. Instead, it outlined steps for how to determine the answer
        (locate both places on a map and compare them) but did not actually provide
        the result of this comparison. The model ended with "Let me know the answer!"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Wisconsin is to the west and
        north of Pennsylvania" which implies a directional difference. The model concludes
        that Carlisle, PA is not east of Wittenberg, WI, but this is not because they
        are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Carlisle, PA is not located east of Wittenberg,

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide a specific reason for
        the NO answer in terms of equality or similarity. It simply states the answer
        is NO after mentioning that one would need to consider directions and whether
        one would need to travel east from one place to the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this, the answer

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply identifies the locations (Carlisle
        in Pennsylvania and Wittenberg in Wisconsin) and states that the answer is
        NO. The model does not explicitly state that the NO answer is due to the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

        of Garden Prairie, IL," it doesn't explicitly say "YES" to the comparative
        question. It also indicates uncertainty by saying "I can't give you a definitive
        answer" and asks for a map to confirm.

        not NO, the second question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer
        at all, so it couldn't have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains how one would go about answering
        the question (by finding locations on a map and comparing positions) but explicitly
        states "I can't physically look at a map" and suggests that the user find
        the locations themselves. This is effectively saying the model cannot determine
        the answer.

        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually provide a conclusion about which city is east of the other.

        east of Garden Prairie, IL, without specifying that they are at the same longitude
        or otherwise equal in position. The model does not give equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Whiskey Creek, FL is located
        in a completely different geographical area than St. Anthony, MN" and notes
        that Florida is in the southern part of the US while Minnesota is in the northern
        part. The NO answer is based on geographical difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations of the states, noting that "Florida is on the eastern coast of the
        US and Minnesota is in the northern part of the country." The model is not
        claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply identified the locations of both
        places and stated "NO" without explaining that the reason was due to equality
        of values. The model didn't complete its reasoning about east/west positioning,
        but it definitely didn't claim the locations were equal.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It does not claim the locations have
        identical coordinates or positions. Instead, it gives other reasoning related
        to the locations being in different states and on different sides of the Mississippi
        River.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that the locations are in different
        regions of the US (Midwest vs. southeastern US) and are "likely on opposite
        sides of the country." The NO answer is based on geographical difference,
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that Florida is in the southeast while Minnesota is in the north.
        The model is implying a directional difference rather than equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Whiskey Creek, FL is not located east of St. Anthony, MN"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Whiskey Creek, FL is located
        in a different region of the US than St. Anthony, MN" which indicates a difference
        in location, not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that "Kentucky is in the eastern US, and Minnesota is in the northern
        US" and concludes that Lakeside Park, KY is not located east of Prior Lake,
        MN. The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude or are at
        the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question" without providing a YES or NO answer. The model indicates it lacks
        the necessary information (can't see maps) to make the comparison, so it refuses
        to provide a definitive answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning about the
        locations of Kentucky and Minnesota, concluding that Lakeside Park, KY is
        not located east of Prior Lake, MN. The model does not claim the locations
        are at the same longitude or equivalent in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - it states that Zilwaukee is in the northern part of the US while Rolling
        Fork is in the southern part, and uses this north/south distinction (rather
        than equality) as the basis for concluding that Zilwaukee is not east of Rolling
        Fork.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it justifies the NO answer by noting that
        "Texas and Colorado are geographically separate states" and describing their
        different geographic positions (Texas Panhandle vs. Rocky Mountain foothills).
        The model is indicating a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Based on this, the answer is likely
        NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, though it uses
        the qualifier "likely." The model then provides geographic reasoning to support
        this answer.

        from Colorado" and "in a different part of the country, making it impossible
        to be east of Dakota Ridge, CO." The model is claiming a directional difference,

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave

        answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and indicates that "Without a map, it's impossible to definitively

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. While it mentions the locations and states,
        it doesn't explicitly state that they have equal values on any measure, nor
        does it give equality as the reason for its NO answer. The model simply concludes
        with "Therefore, the answer is NO" without explaining the specific reason
        for this conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply says to compare the geographic
        locations and then concludes with NO. There is no mention of equality being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this logic,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Ojus, FL is in Florida and Puxico,
        MO is in Missouri, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly mentioning equality
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any comparison or state that values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends with
        "Let me know if you'd like me to provide the answers to those steps" without
        actually providing an answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It simply says "NO" without explaining
        that the locations have the same position or equal values. The model mentions
        comparing locations but doesn't conclude they are equal as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer. While the model doesn't provide much reasoning,
        it does give a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that West Conshohocken is in Pennsylvania on the East Coast while Berwyn
        is in Illinois in the Midwest, and you would need to cross a state line to
        travel between them. The model is not claiming the locations are at the same
        longitude or have equal positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "West Conshohocken is in Pennsylvania" and "Berwyn is in Illinois"
        and that these are "different states." The NO is based on a difference, not
        an equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It started to analyze the locations but never
        reached a conclusion. The response ends without stating which location is
        closer to the US-Canada border.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Rockwell City, IA is located
        west of Lakota, ND" which indicates a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Rockwell City,
        IA and Lakota, ND. The model clearly provides a NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        with the given information)" which indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the
        model is saying it cannot determine the answer rather than providing a definitive

        or not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the question. It only outlined steps for how to determine if Torrington,
        CT is east of Gahanna, OH, but did not actually execute those steps or provide
        a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me know your answer!" suggesting
        the model is asking the user to make the determination rather than providing

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Torrington is located in a
        different state and therefore is not east of Gahanna." The reason for the
        NO is not based on equality of values but on the model's assertion that being
        in a different state means it cannot be east of Gahanna (which is incorrect
        reasoning, but that's not relevant to our classification).

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO
        answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" after explaining that it cannot verify the geographical

      result: 'NO'
    795ffdce-552b-445d-af9c-16ab24fc034e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Florida is on the eastern side of the US while Missouri is
        in the central part, describing them as "opposite sides of the country." The
        model concludes that Schall Circle, FL is not located east of Florissant,
        MO based on this geographical reasoning, not because they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to the question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Schall Circle is in Florida
        and Florissant is in Missouri, and they are separated by the Mississippi River.
        The NO answer is based on geographical separation, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies in
        parentheses "(We cannot be sure without a map)". This indicates the model
        is not making a comparative determination but rather stating it cannot verify
        the information due to lack of data. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison without a map.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Schall Circle, FL
        would be in a different geographic location from Florissant, MO" because "Florida
        is south of Missouri." The NO answer is based on this difference in location,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't claim the locations have the same longitude
        or are at the same position. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the relative
        positions of Florida (southern US) and Missouri (central US), implying they
        have different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how one could determine
        the answer, but did not actually state a conclusion. The model offered to

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it listed steps for how to solve the problem and
        then asked the user to provide the answer. Since there is no clear YES/NO
        answer given, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are in different states on "different sides of a large body of water."
        It's not claiming the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states (New Jersey and South Carolina)
        and in different regions (northeast vs southeast).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. It simply concludes that Lake Hiawatha is not east
        of Folly Beach without mentioning equality as the reason. The model does not
        explicitly state that the values being compared (the east-west positions)
        are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, Lake Hiawatha,
        NJ is not located east of Folly Beach, SC. So the answer is NO." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Folly Beach would be located to the west of Lake
        Hiawatha, NJ." This indicates a difference in location (west vs. east), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "The east-west axis places
        them on opposite sides of the United States," indicating it believes there
        is a significant difference in their positions. The model is not saying NO
        because the locations have equal longitude values.

        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO" without
        explaining why. Since the model doesn't mention equality as the reason for
        its NO answer, this criterion is not met.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. While it doesn't provide detailed reasoning after

        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (locate
        both places on a map and compare locations) but never actually provided the
        answer. The model stated it "needs visual aid to answer" but didn't give a
        final determination.

        are equal or the same. It simply notes the locations of the two cities (one
        in Ohio, one in Wisconsin) and concludes "NO" without explaining that this
        is due to equality of values. In fact, it doesn't provide any specific reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for its NO answer - it doesn't mention equality or similarity between the
        locations. The model simply states "NO" after noting that determining the
        answer requires a map to see relative locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model doesn't provide much reasoning, it does give a clear NO response

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how one could determine
        the answer (look at a map, compare locations) but did not actually state a
