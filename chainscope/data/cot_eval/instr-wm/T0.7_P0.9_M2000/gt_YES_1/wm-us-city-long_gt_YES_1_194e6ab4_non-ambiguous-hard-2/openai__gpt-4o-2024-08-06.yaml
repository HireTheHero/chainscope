        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lorane, PA is generally
        west of Pomona Park, FL" and bases its NO answer on this directional difference.
        The model is claiming there is a directional difference between the locations,
        not that they have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, indicating that Lorane, PA is not east
        of Pomona Park, FL. The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparison

        is indicating a difference in values (Lorane is west of Pomona Park), not
        equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, indicating that Lorane, PA is not located
