        in eastward extension rather than equality.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. This is a clear negative comparative result

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that South Mount Vernon,
        OH is east of Davenport, IA (noting a difference in location). The model notes
        that Ohio is in the Eastern time zone while Iowa is in the Central time zone,
        and concludes that South Mount Vernon is east of Davenport. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.

        that "South Mount Vernon is east of Davenport" because "Ohio is east of Iowa."
        The NO answer appears to be in response to the original comparative question
        (which likely asked if South Mount Vernon is west of Davenport).

        in California. The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Canaan, CT is north of Montura, FL (not east of it). The model is making
        a geographical comparison where it identifies a difference in position (north-south),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        being asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations have a different
        directional relationship than what was asked - indicating that Canaan, CT
        is north of Montura, FL (not east) because "Florida is south of Connecticut"
        and "Anything in Connecticut will be north, not east, of anything in Florida."
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Canaan, CT is likely
        west of Montura, FL (indicating a directional difference), which is the basis
        for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Montura, FL is significantly
        west of Canaan, CT" which indicates a difference in values (not equality)
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative comparative result
        to the original question.

        question doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response after working through its reasoning about the relative locations
        of Simonton, TX and Deadwood, SD.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Simonton, TX cannot be east
        of Deadwood, SD because of their geographical relationship, noting that Texas
        would need to be "considerably west" of South Dakota to be on the same line
        of longitude. The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        being asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning about the
        relative positions of the locations, concluding that "Deadwood isn't far enough
        west to be west of Simonton." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality, as the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO." at the end
        of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Simonton, TX is not east
        of Deadwood, SD because Texas would need to be "significantly further east"
        to offset the north/south difference, implying the locations are different.
        The model is suggesting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Simonton, TX is east of Deadwood,
        SD.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional assessment, stating
        that "Texas is generally far south and west of South Dakota" and concludes
        that "Simonton is highly unlikely to be east of Deadwood." The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference, not equality of values.

        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Gruver, TX is likely west
        of Dakota Ridge, CO" which indicates a difference in longitude. The model's
        reasoning contradicts its final "NO" answer, but we must take the explicit
        statements at face value without resolving contradictions. The model does
        not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        "Texas is generally east of Colorado" but "the Denver metro area and thus
        Dakota Ridge is still significantly west of the Texas panhandle." The NO answer
        is based on a directional comparison, not on equality of values.

        north on the East Coast are also further east due to the curvature of the
        coastline," but never explicitly states they have equal longitudes. The model
        gives a NO answer without clearly stating that equality is the reason.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Cuthbert is significantly
        west of the easternmost point of Long Island," indicating a difference in
        position rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference.

        east of Antonito" (indicating a difference in position), and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" based on the reasoning that
        Highlandville is actually west of Antonito, contradicting what might be expected
        from the general positions of Missouri and Colorado. The model specifically
        states "Checking a map confirms this" after suggesting "It's possible Highlandville
        is actually west of Antonito."
