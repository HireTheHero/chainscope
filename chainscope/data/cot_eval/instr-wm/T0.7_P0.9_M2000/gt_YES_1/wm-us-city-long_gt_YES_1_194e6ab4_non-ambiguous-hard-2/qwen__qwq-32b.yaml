        Carlisle, Pennsylvania" and that "the answer should be YES." After reevaluating,
        the model explicitly states "The correct answer should be YES" and provides

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is entirely a thinking process
        without a clear final answer. While the model considers both YES and NO as
        potential answers at different points, it never provides a definitive conclusion.
        The model mentions "\boxed{YES}" at one point but continues to deliberate
        afterward, showing it hadn't reached a final decision. The response ends with
        "I'll proceed with that" but doesn't actually state a final answer.

        the geographic locations, it ends with an incomplete thought "the answer would
        be NO, since Rockwell City is not in North Dakota but in Iowa" which doesn't
