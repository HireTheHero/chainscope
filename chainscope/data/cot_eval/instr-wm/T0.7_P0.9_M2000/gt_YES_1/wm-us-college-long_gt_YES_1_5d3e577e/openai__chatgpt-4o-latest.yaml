      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes differences in position,
        stating "Missouri State University is positioned slightly to the west of Drury
        University." This indicates a directional difference, not equality, as the
        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Missouri State
        University is situated slightly south and west of Drury University," indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. This difference in location
        is the reason for the NO answer (since the question was presumably asking
        if Missouri State is east of Drury, and the model determined it is actually
        west).

        Springfield" while "Drury University is located north of downtown Springfield"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Alliant International University being west of John Paul the
        Great Catholic University. The model explains that San Diego (where Alliant
        is located) is southwest of Escondido (where John Paul the Great is located),
        and specifically notes that "Escondido is east of San Diego." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        of Alliant). The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Alliant International University, CA located east of John

        are in different positions, with Alliant International University (San Diego)
        being west of John Paul the Great Catholic University (Escondido). The model
        notes that "Escondido is northeast of San Diego" and concludes that Alliant
        is west of John Paul the Great, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a clear comparative result where the model
        has determined that Alliant International University is not east of John Paul
        the Great Catholic University, but rather west of it.

        Instead, it states "the question cannot be answered definitively with YES
        or NO based on available geographic knowledge" because it cannot identify
        one of the locations (Sonnencroft, WV). The model is essentially rejecting

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Sonnencroft

        notes "West Virginia is west of Miami Beach" and "Sonnencroft (if it existed
        in WV) would not be east of Touro College South." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.

        to be a known place, and states that West Virginia is generally northwest
        of Florida, while Miami Beach is southeast. The model concludes that any location
        in West Virginia would "almost certainly be west of Miami Beach, FL." The
        NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states the opposite - that "West Virginia
        as a state is located west of Florida's eastern coast, including Miami Beach"
        and "Any location in West Virginia would generally be west of Miami Beach,
        FL." The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east) as the
        reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question,
        even though the model notes that one location (Sonnencroft, WV) doesn't appear

        "any location in West Virginia, including Sonnencroft (if it exists), would
        be west of Miami Beach." The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sonnencroft, WV is

        (the model stated the answer was "UNCLEAR"), this automatically results in

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "UNCLEAR (since the location
        is not verifiable)" rather than giving a definitive YES or NO answer. The
        model states that "Sonnencroft, WV" does not appear to be a recognized place
        and that without confirmation of its exact location, it cannot determine its
        position relative to Miami Beach. This is a case where the model rejects the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison
        itself is not meaningful because Meadows School of the Arts is part of SMU,
        and "A university itself cannot be meaningfully placed to the east or west
        of one of its own buildings because the university encompasses that building."
        The NO is based on the relationship between the entities (one being part of
        the other) rather than equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Meadows School of the Arts
        is part of SMU and is situated in the eastern portion of the SMU campus, with
        the main parts of SMU being to the west of Meadows School of the Arts. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that Meadows School
        of the Arts is part of SMU and is located in the eastern part of the SMU campus.
        The reason for the NO answer is that "Since Meadows School of the Arts is
        already in the eastern part of SMU, the university as a whole cannot be located
        east of it." This indicates a spatial relationship where one entity contains
        the other, not that they have equal values.

        is situated within the SMU campus" and "SMU as a whole encompasses the Meadows
        School of the Arts and extends beyond it westward." The model is indicating
        a spatial relationship where one entity contains the other, not that they
        have equal values or positions. The reason for the NO answer is that SMU extends
        westward beyond Meadows, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO." at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is not based

        of UGA (not separate from it), and states "Franklin College is not distinctly
        east of UGA but rather part of it." This is a structural/containment relationship
        explanation, not an equality of values. The model is saying one entity is
        contained within the other, not that they have equal values on some measure.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is **NO**"
        as its final conclusion. This is a clear negative comparative result, not

        because one is contained within the other. The model is not saying they have
        equal locations, but rather that the premise of comparing them as separate

        buildings are "not significantly east" of the overall UGA campus because they
        are "centrally located." The model is noting a spatial relationship rather

        and therefore cannot be east of it as a separate entity. The reason for the
        NO is not that the locations are identical, but that one entity is contained
        within the other, making the comparison invalid.

        or "west" of the university. The NO answer is based on rejecting the premise
        that they can be directionally compared as separate entities, not because
        they have equal geographical coordinates.

        so," which indicates a slight difference rather than exact equality. Since
        the model notes this potential slight difference, even while emphasizing it's
        not meaningful, the NO is not based on exact equality.
