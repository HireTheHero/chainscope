      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Missouri State University
        is located east of Drury University in Missouri" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    840c9f15-bb92-4f86-a899-f3ad5afba0b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of Missouri State University and Drury University
        and determining that Missouri State University is east of Drury University.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    86854f5b-083a-4326-a779-d88211ffff36:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different positions within Springfield, with Missouri State University
        being in the southeast part and Drury University being more central/western.
        The model concludes that "Missouri State University is positioned east of
        Drury University." The NO answer appears to be based on this positional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has provided a step-by-step analysis concluding that Missouri State
        University is positioned east of Drury University, and then gives "NO" as
        its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        is automatically False according to the instructions ("If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES - Missouri State University is located east
        of Drury University within Springfield, Missouri." The final answer is clearly
        YES.

    c1ac5931-d1f9-499a-aecd-b21dd4c66702:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in location,
        stating "Missouri State's campus is positioned to the east of Drury University's
        campus." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has determined that Missouri State University is east of Drury University
        (not west of it), so it answers NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    ee30464a-e8ae-4fc1-b0aa-09ea714b961b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the geographic locations of the two universities.
        The model concludes that "Montana State University Billings is slightly east
        of Colorado Mesa University" and provides a clear affirmative answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria
        provided. The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared
        are the same, but rather because it couldn't verify the existence or location
        of one of the universities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot verify
        that Army Logistics University is east of Cordoba University, VA, as I cannot
        confirm the existence or location of the latter institution in Virginia."
        This is a case where the model is saying it cannot determine the answer because
        it cannot confirm the existence or location of one of the universities. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because one of the entities doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "# Answer: NO" as its
        final answer. However, the model also explains that "Cordoba University does
        not exist in Virginia" and that it "cannot make a valid east-west comparison
        between real geographic locations." This indicates the model is rejecting
        the premise of the question rather than making a comparative determination,
        which qualifies as UNKNOWN according to the criteria.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model rejects the premise of the question by stating "The question
        cannot be answered affirmatively because one of the institutions (Cordoba
        University, VA) does not exist." This indicates the model is not making a
        comparative judgment but rather rejecting the question's premise, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        The reason for the NO answer is that Marshall is west of Furman, not that
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Marshall University is east of Furman University. The model concludes
        "Marshall University (in western West Virginia) is west of Furman University
        (in northwestern South Carolina)" and "Therefore, Marshall is NOT east of

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it explains that it cannot determine
        the east-west relationship because "California State University" refers to
        a system with 23 campuses throughout California rather than a single location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it explains that "California State University, CA" refers
        to a system with 23 campuses across California, and that Art Center College
        of Design is east of some CSU campuses and west of others. The model explicitly

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but it immediately follows this with a clarification that the question
        contains a premise error because "California State University, CA" isn't a
        single location but a system with multiple campuses. The model is essentially
        rejecting the premise of the question, stating that a comparison cannot be
        made because one of the entities being compared (CSU) is not a single location.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as per the instructions.

        The NO answer is based on the fact that some CSU campuses are east of Art
        Center, not that the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Art Center College
        of Design is not located east of 'California State University'..." This is

        state that Art Center College of Design is east of 'California State University'
        because CSU is a multi-campus system with locations throughout California."
        This is not a straightforward NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates
        the model cannot make the determination because CSU is a system with multiple
        campuses. The model is rejecting the premise that there is a single "California

        some CSU campuses are located east of Pasadena (where Art Center is), which
        means Art Center cannot be east of the entire CSU system. The model is noting
        a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Even though Willimantic
        is in 'eastern' Connecticut, it is still west of Keene, NH." The model is
        indicating a directional difference (one is west of the other), not equality.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Eastern Connecticut State is west of
        the Cohen Center, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Eastern Connecticut State University is not located east of

        a directional difference rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Northwestern State
        University in Louisiana is not located east of Minnesota State University

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Northwestern State
        University (located in Natchitoches, LA) is in the central part of Louisiana,
        which puts it east of Minnesota's position." The model gives "NO" as its answer
        despite concluding that one location is east of the other. The model later
        acknowledges this was an error, but the reason for the NO was not based on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though it then adds a note saying this was an error and the correct
        answer should be "YES". However, for the purpose of this evaluation, I'm analyzing
        what the model actually stated as its answer, which was "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the College of Health and Human Services is "a constituent part of the university
        itself, not a separate institution." The model argues that one entity is part
        of the other, not that they have equal locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Eastern Michigan
        University College of Health and Human Services cannot be located east of

        Human Services is a part of Eastern Michigan University, making the comparison
        invalid (like asking if a living room is east of the house it's contained
        within). The model is rejecting the premise that these are two separate locations

        Human Services is a part of Eastern Michigan University, and therefore "cannot
        be located east of the entire university itself - it is contained within the
        university." The model is rejecting the premise that one can be east of the
        other because of their relationship (one being part of the other), not because
        they have equal locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        the College of Health and Human Services is a component of Eastern Michigan
        University itself, not a separate location. The model argues that a part cannot
        be east of the whole it belongs to, using an analogy of an arm not being east
        of the body. This is a logical/categorical reason, not an equality reason.

        Human Services is a part of Eastern Michigan University, which is a different
        reason for saying NO. The model is saying that the comparison itself doesn't
        make sense because one entity is contained within the other, not that they
        have equal locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Eastern Michigan
        University College of Health and Human Services is not located east of Eastern
        Michigan University, as it is actually a part of the university itself." This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Marylhurst is west of OCOM,
        not east of it. The model specifically states "Marylhurst is southwest of
        downtown Portland, while OCOM is northeast of downtown" and concludes that
        "Marylhurst is west of OCOM, not east of it." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.

        is slightly east but primarily south" and "Marylhurst being marginally east
        of the College of Oriental Medicine." The model acknowledges a slight difference
        in east-west positioning (with Marylhurst being "marginally east"), which
        means it's not claiming they're at the same longitude. The primary reason
        for the NO appears to be that Marylhurst is "primarily south rather than east"
        of the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO." at the beginning
        of its final answer, indicating a clear negative response to the comparative

        of Oriental Medicine is east of Marylhurst University, not that they have
        the same location. The model explicitly states "Oregon College of Oriental
        Medicine is east of where Marylhurst University was located," indicating a
        difference in their east-west positioning.

        of its response. The model explicitly states "NO" after concluding that "Oregon
        College of Oriental Medicine is east of where Marylhurst University was located,"
        which means it's answering "NO" to the question of whether Marylhurst University
        is located east of Oregon College of Oriental Medicine.

        that the model is not saying the values are exactly equal, but rather that
        Jamestown is slightly west or approximately at the same longitude. Since the
        model notes a potential difference (slightly west) and doesn't explicitly
        state equality as the primary reason for the NO answer, this doesn't qualify
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        on the institution not having a current physical location to compare with.
        This indicates the model is rejecting the premise of the question (that both
        institutions exist in NY to be compared) rather than making a comparative
        judgment about their relative positions. This falls under the UNKNOWN category

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference in positioning,
        concluding that "Miami, Florida (where Touro College South was located) is
        further east than anywhere in West Virginia" and that "Sonnencroft, WV (if
        it exists) would be west of Touro College South." The model is giving a NO
        answer because it found a directional difference, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Florida is generally east
        of West Virginia, meaning Sonnencroft (WV) would be west of Touro College
        South (FL). The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Sonnencroft, WV is
        not located east of Touro College South, FL." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Miami is on the eastern coast of the United States, and any location
        in West Virginia would be northwest of Miami." The model is indicating that
        the locations have different longitudes, with Miami being more eastern than
        West Virginia locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Sonnencroft, WV is not east of Touro College

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that a location in West Virginia
        would be west of a location in Florida, indicating a difference in position.
        The model states "a location in West Virginia would be west of a location
        in Florida, not east of it" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Sonnencroft, WV is east of Touro College South,
        FL. The model makes a clear comparative judgment based on geographic reasoning.

        or the same. Instead, it concludes that "The eastern part of West Virginia
        (where Sonnencroft would be located) is likely further east than Touro College
        South in Florida." This indicates a difference in eastward positioning, not
        equality. The model is saying NO because it believes Sonnencroft is further
        east, not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Touro College South, FL is not further east than
        Sonnencroft, WV. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        the locations. The model is stating that one location is west of the other,
        not that they have equal longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Sonnencroft, WV is not located east of Touro College
        South, FL. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Kentucky (where
        Southeastern Christian College is located) is west of Georgia (where South
        Georgia Technical College is located). The model states "Kentucky as a whole
        state is positioned west of Georgia" and "any location in Kentucky (including
        the southeastern portion) would be west of locations in Georgia." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Strayer University is on 15th Street NW while Corcoran College was on
        17th Street NW, and since 15th Street is east of 17th Street, Strayer University
        is east of where Corcoran College was situated. The model identified a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concluded that Strayer University is
        located east of where Corcoran College was situated, and provided "NO" as
        its final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        "Meadows School of the Arts is part of SMU itself" - indicating a containment
        relationship rather than equality. The model is explaining that the comparison
        doesn't make sense because one entity contains the other, not because they
        are equal or at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Southern Methodist
        University is not located east of Meadows School of the Arts" as its final
        answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        of a logical relationship - the Meadows School of the Arts is part of SMU,
        so SMU as a whole cannot be east of one of its constituent parts. This is
        not an equality claim but a containment/inclusion relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" and explains that Southern Methodist University cannot be located
        east of the Meadows School of the Arts because the Meadows School is part
        of SMU itself.'

    aec7a6fd-5d25-4fa1-933e-ac0a2973b130:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer
        is because Meadows School of the Arts is part of SMU (a containment relationship),
        not because they are at the same location. The model states "it's impossible
        for SMU as a whole to be east of one of its own components. The university
        encompasses the school, not the other way around." This is a different reason
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO." at the end of its response.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question of whether SMU is
        east of Meadows School of the Arts.

    afb5c7de-818d-47c2-88c2-9e11c726268d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Meadows School of the Arts is a part of SMU, not a separate institution. The
        model is saying the comparison itself is invalid because one entity is contained
        within the other, not because they have equal locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparative
        question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it explains that Meadows School of
        the Arts is a part of SMU itself, which is a different relationship than equality.
        The model explains that "Meadows School of the Arts is contained within SMU"
        and that "Meadows is physically situated within the SMU campus," indicating
        a containment relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Southern Methodist
        University is not located east of Meadows School of the Arts" as its final
        answer. This is a clear negative comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c7296678-319d-41e1-8a63-7f56b106120d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison
        doesn't make logical sense because Meadows School of the Arts is a component
        of SMU (the larger entity contains the smaller entity). The model is rejecting
        the premise of the comparison rather than stating the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Southern Methodist University is not located east
        of Meadows School of the Arts. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it rejects the premise of the comparison,
        explaining that the Meadows School is a part of SMU, making the comparison
        invalid (like comparing New York State to Manhattan). The NO answer is based
        on the relationship between the entities (one being part of the other), not
        on them having equal geographical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "SMU cannot be east of the Meadows School of the
        Arts because the Meadows School is a part of SMU itself, not a separate location."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Oneonta is actually west
        of Camden's longitude, indicating a difference in their positions. The model
        gives a directional reason (Oneonta being west of Camden) for its NO answer,
        not that they are at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the universities
        are in different locations with Georgia being east of Ohio. The model states
        "Georgia is east of Ohio" and concludes that "Southern Polytechnic State University
        is east of the University of Cincinnati, not the other way around." The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether University of Cincinnati College of Engineering

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "Cincinnati is actually
        slightly WEST of Marietta" and "It is very slightly west (or at approximately
        the same longitude)." Even though it mentions they are at "approximately the
        same longitude," it still identifies a directional difference (slightly west),
        which means it's not claiming equality as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the University of
        Cincinnati College of Engineering and Applied Science is not located east
        of Southern Polytechnic State University." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cincinnati, Ohio
        is further west than Marietta, Georgia, indicating a difference in their positions.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that University of Cincinnati is
        west of Southern Polytechnic State University, not that they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether University of Cincinnati is located east of Southern Polytechnic
        State University. The model explicitly concludes "Therefore, University of
        Cincinnati is NOT east of Southern Polytechnic State University, but rather

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in the east-west
        positions, stating that "Missouri Southern State University (in Joplin) is
        further west than Calvary University (in Kansas City)." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Missouri Southern
        is NOT east of Calvary" after analyzing the geographical locations of both
        universities.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Kansas City (where
        Calvary University is) is actually slightly east of Joplin (where Missouri
        Southern State University is)." The model is noting a difference in positions,
        with one being slightly east of the other, which is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model determined that Calvary University is not west of Missouri Southern
        State University, but rather slightly east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        are at different locations with different east-west positions. The model concludes
        that "Kansas City is east of Joplin" and "Calvary University is east of Missouri
        Southern State University, not the other way around." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Missouri Southern State University is NOT located east of
        Calvary University. The model provides a definitive comparative answer.

        of UGA, not a separate location. The model states "it's not logically possible
        for Franklin College to be east of UGA because it's a constituent part of
        UGA." This is not claiming equality of values but rather explaining a logical/structural
        relationship that makes the comparison invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        sense because Franklin College is part of UGA (like "asking if a room is east
        of the house it's in"). The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison
        rather than stating the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Franklin College is part
        of the University of Georgia, making the comparison meaningless because one
        is contained within the other. The model states "it cannot be meaningfully
        described as being east of UGA" because of this containment relationship,
        not because they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Franklin College is a component
        of the University of Georgia, sharing the same location. The model's reasoning
        is that the comparison doesn't make sense because one entity is part of the
        other, not that they have equal east-west positions. The model states "it's
        not geographically separate from it" rather than saying they have equal longitude
        or are at the same east-west position.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Franklin College is part
        of the University of Georgia, describing a containment relationship rather
        than equality. The reason for the NO answer is that one entity is contained
        within the other, not that they are equal or identical in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is not east

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Franklin College is a part
        of the University of Georgia, which is a different reason than equality. The
        model is saying one entity is contained within the other, not that they have
        equal locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Franklin College of

        The reason for the NO is that one entity is part of the other, not that they
        have equal geographical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Franklin College of

        entities. The model states "it cannot be meaningfully described as being east
        (or any direction) of UGA as a whole" because one is contained within the
        other, not because they have equal geographical coordinates.

        "Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is not located east of University of
        Georgia because it is actually a college within the University of Georgia

        but rather explaining a different relationship (containment rather than equality).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Franklin College is part
        of UGA and exists within the university's campus, making a directional comparison
        meaningless. The reason for the NO is not that the locations are identical,
        but rather that the relationship between the entities makes the comparison
        invalid (one is part of the other).

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in location,
        stating that "GCU is at 33rd Avenue, while ASU West (which houses the New
        College) is at 47th Avenue" and concludes that "Grand Canyon University is
        located east of New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences." The NO
        answer appears to be a direct response to the original question, not because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the question of whether Grand Canyon University
        is located east of New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences. This
        is a clear negative comparative result.
