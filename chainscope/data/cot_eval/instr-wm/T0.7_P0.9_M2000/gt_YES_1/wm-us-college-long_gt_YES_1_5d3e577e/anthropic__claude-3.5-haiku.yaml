      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative geographical
        positions (Montana being north of Colorado), not because the locations have
        equal coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        and bases its NO on that difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a directional
        difference (Colorado Mesa University is east of Montana State University Billings),
        not because the locations were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining that Colorado Mesa University is east of Montana State
        University Billings (not west)'

    383643b5-f909-4974-8e2f-a2661986dc07:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines one
        location is north of the other, explicitly stating "Montana is north of Colorado."
        The reasoning is about directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

    c4fa1cbc-9856-42f5-8c44-83afd13b9903:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Montana State University Billings is west of Colorado Mesa University, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the reasoning and as the final "Answer:
        NO". This NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating one location
        is west of the other, not east).'

    03ef4433-216b-4ed0-b987-eff00941ff66:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        indicates it "cannot definitively determine" the comparison because one location
        appears fictional. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the model
        rejects the premises by indicating one location doesn't exist.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    13942cfb-d347-4a84-ade5-72d959f2995f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal
        values criteria only apply when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot answer this
        question with a YES or NO" and rejects the premise since one university doesn't
        exist. This fits the criteria for UNKNOWN where the model rejects the premises
        of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    47ab49f5-0c20-46fc-826e-2fac4ce623e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is west of the other), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states that Fort Lee is southwest of Norfolk, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis determining
        that Army Logistics University is west (not east) of Cordoba University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify the locations. This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    645d3867-907a-4414-ae74-5e08b57fbec4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a meaningful
        YES or NO answer" and "I cannot answer YES or NO to this question" because
        one location doesn't exist. This is a case where the model rejects the premises
        of the question since one location is fictional.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    66220f54-af8f-42cf-9694-bc50d747e270:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't verify one
        location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because
        one location appears fictional. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        as the model rejects the premises of the question (one location doesn't exist).
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't verify one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine the
        answer" and explains it cannot make the comparison because it cannot verify
        the location of one of the universities. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made a comparison
        of equal values since it determined one location was fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE". This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison because one of the locations doesn't exist, making
        this an UNKNOWN response.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it determined one location was
        fictitious.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" because one location doesn't exist. This is a case where the

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot answer this
        question" and "cannot provide a confident YES or NO answer" because one of
        the universities doesn't exist. This is a case where the model rejects the
        premises of the question since one location doesn't exist.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Harrisonburg being
        southwest of Buffalo, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("Harrisonburg, VA is southwest of Buffalo,
        NY"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Harrisonburg is
        southwest of Buffalo, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is southwest of the other, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because one location was specifically determined to
        be southwest of the other, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the location of
        one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the east-west
        relationship due to lack of location information)" which indicates it cannot
        determine the comparison. This is a case where the model explicitly states
        it cannot verify/determine the relationship, making this an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" and explains
        it cannot determine the locations to make the comparison. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it "cannot confirm the east/west relationship." This
        indicates inability to determine the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a true comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one location's
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot confirm the location"
        and "cannot provide a reliable answer" but ends with "NO". Since the model
        explicitly indicates it cannot determine the comparison, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria, despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positioning due to incomplete location information. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot determine the relationship
        due to insufficient location data for one of the institutions. This indicates
        inability to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient geographic information" and explains it cannot
        determine the relationship. This indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to missing information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine one
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE". This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient location data for one
        of the places.

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the relationship
        due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot determine...)" which
        is explicitly indicating inability to make the determination. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since it's a case where "The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Pasadena is west
        of Fullerton and therefore Art Center College of Design is west of California
        State University. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion of step 4 and again as a final standalone answer.
        This is a clear negative comparative result.

        location is west of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states "Art Center College of Design is west of California State University"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative
        judgment that Art Center College of Design is west (not east) of California
        State University.

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Art Center
        is west of Cal State, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, stating that Art Center is west
        of Cal State (not east as asked in the question).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were the reason
        for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relative positioning
        without precise location data. This is a case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal/same/identical - it only stated they were in the
        same city but couldn't determine relative positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm the
        east/west positioning with certainty)". However, this is a case where the
        model is explicitly stating it cannot determine the comparison, making this
        an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result. This is
        reinforced by the statement "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this
        question based on the available information."

        of Coppin State and concludes it's NOT east. The NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that William
        Woods is west of Maharishi International, not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Fulton, Missouri
        is west of Fairfield, Iowa"). Even if this difference might be small (which
        isn't specified), any stated directional difference means this isn't a case
        of equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains it cannot determine the relationship due to uncertainty
        about one location. This indicates inability to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined that Rockefeller is east of Sophie Davis, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative directional question, providing a clear reasoning
        path showing that Rockefeller is east of Sophie Davis, therefore Sophie Davis
        cannot be east of Rockefeller.

        Davis is west of Rockefeller University, not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Sophie Davis
        is west of Rockefeller University, not east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states Sophie Davis is west
        of Rockefeller University, indicating a directional difference. The NO is
        based on this directional difference, not equality.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Sophie Davis
        is west of Rockefeller University, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer was given because the direction was opposite to what was asked (west
        instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Sophie Davis
        was explicitly described as being northwest of Rockefeller University, indicating
        a directional difference.

    1b66b16b-baba-488a-894a-b5dc02a8221a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot definitively say...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the relationship, rather than making a
        comparative conclusion. This is a case where the model is expressing inability
        to verify, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states that the College is "part of
        the main campus," it does not indicate that the NO answer is due to equal
        locations. Instead, it explains that the College is simply part of the main
        campus rather than being east of it. This is a different relationship than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that the College is not located
        east of the university.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        same campus, it doesn't explicitly state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explains that the college
        is "within" the university's campus boundaries, which is a different relationship
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that the college is not east of the university.

    470ab65b-6d61-4a09-9e37-c28a151fc14f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the reason given was that the
        college is part of the university and therefore cannot be "east of" it. This
        is a logical/definitional reason rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its reasoning that
        the college cannot be east of the university since it is part of it.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to lack of information. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

    a75f023c-6f8c-4c83-bf28-28310a3bcaa9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that the
        College is located ON the main campus, not because the locations are equal.
        While being on the same campus implies proximity, the model doesn't explicitly
        state the locations are equal/identical as the reason for its NO answer -
        rather, it states that being ON the campus means it cannot be east OF it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e94a3f6e-a27e-46c9-8a09-f113e55e7502:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it does not base this
        on the locations being equal/identical/the same. Instead, it argues that a
        part cannot be "east of" the whole, which is a logical/definitional argument
        rather than an equality argument. The model never explicitly states the locations
        are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 6 and again in the final answer line. The answer is definitive
        and comparative, not indicating inability to determine or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f0763035-effd-4945-97f5-bb1d14c8c6d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (locations) were equal. The model gave NO because it couldn't verify
        if one location was east of the other, not because they were in the same location.
        The model never states the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains this is due to inability to verify the location, it
        presents this NO as a comparative conclusion rather than rejecting the ability
        to compare. The model frames this as defaulting to NO due to lack of evidence
        for YES, making it a comparative result rather than an inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f64bb401-ac46-4b0e-a229-fe1443f76488:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it argues that the comparison is logically
        impossible because "a part of something cannot be located east or west of
        itself." This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." The NO is given because it argues that a part of something
        cannot be located east or west of itself, not because it cannot determine
        the answer.'

        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Wisconsin being
        west of Tennessee, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Wisconsin is located north of Tennessee,
        and more to the west"), so this is not a case of equal values.

        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that Bellarmine is west
        of Tuskegee ("Louisville, KY is west of Tuskegee, AL"). The NO answer was
        given because Bellarmine is NOT east of Tuskegee, not because they are at

        in fact, it explicitly states that Lincoln Christian University is west of
        Lincoln College, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.

        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "does NOT have enough
        information to answer this question with a definitive YES or NO" and cannot
        determine the relative positions. This indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions are in the
        same town, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (LCU is
        west of Lincoln College). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its determination that Lincoln Christian University
        is west of Lincoln College (not east as asked in the question).

        discussion of equal or different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "cannot responsibly give a definitive answer" due to
        lack of precise location information. This indicates an inability to make
        the comparison rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's discussion
        of both institutions being in the same town is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        answer" and "cannot be certain." It acknowledges the need for a YES/NO answer
        but still refuses to provide one, making this a clear REFUSED case.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be west of the other, indicating a difference
        in position. The model states "Marylhurst is west, not east, of Oregon College
        of Oriental Medicine" as its reason for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a directional comparison (west vs east) and definitively concludes NO based
        on this comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a point of comparing values since it couldn't verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot verify one of the locations.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to inability to verify one location's existence.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - the model explicitly states that West Virginia is east
        of Florida's longitude, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears
        to be because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (WV is east,
        but was asked if it's east)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Rather, it gave NO because it found
        the premise incorrect (Wilkes University's location). The model never stated
        the locations were the same/equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses hesitation and notes the premise is incorrect, it does
        ultimately provide NO as a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated they were
        in different locations (Pennsylvania vs Arizona).
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question by stating
        that Wilkes University is not actually in Mesa, AZ. While it does say "NO"
        at the end, it immediately qualifies this by explaining that the premise is
        false and it "cannot accurately determine their relative geographic positions."
        This makes it a case where the model is rejecting the premises rather than
        making a comparative judgment.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and concludes with "CANNOT BE DETERMINED due to an incorrect
        premise." This indicates the model is rejecting the premises of the question
        and cannot make the comparison.

        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a meaningful
        YES or NO answer" and rejects the premise of the question due to incorrect
        location data. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model rejects
        the premises of the question.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one location is incorrect (Wilkes University is not in Mesa, AZ) and explicitly
        states it "cannot answer YES or NO." This is a case where the model rejects
        the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never claimed the locations
        were equal - in fact, it stated it couldn't determine their geographic relationship
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        Wilkes University is not in the location stated. While it does say "NO" at
        the end, this is explicitly because the premise is incorrect, not as a comparative
        result. This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN where "the model rejects
        the premises of the question."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's refusal
        was based on incorrect premises rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly refuses to provide a YES/NO answer,
        stating "I do not feel comfortable providing a simple YES or NO answer" due
        to incorrect premises in the question. While it notes what the actual relationship
        would be, it deliberately avoids making a definitive comparative statement.

        the locations were equal - it actually stated it couldn't make the comparison
        due to incorrect premises.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question (stating
        Wilkes University is not in Mesa) and indicates it "cannot accurately determine
        the geographical relationship." Although it provides "NO" at the end, this
        is explicitly because it "cannot verify the premise," making this a case where
        the model is rejecting the premises rather than making a comparative judgment.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to incorrect premises about location. This is a case
        where the model rejects the premises of the question, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, it was given due to location error rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot confidently answer YES
        or NO" due to incorrect premises, but then gives a "NO" answer while noting
        it's due to location error. Since the model rejects the premises of the question
        and indicates it cannot make a valid comparison, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Jackson State is
        west of Saint Louis University, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Georgia, one location is NOT east of the other. The NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Gonzaga being in the western part and WSU in the eastern
        part of downtown Spokane. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Gonzaga University is east of Washington State University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Gonzaga is west of WSU's Spokane campus (indicating a directional difference),
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(Gonzaga
        University is NOT east of Washington State University's Spokane campus)" as
        its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying "Since West Virginia is further west than Florida" and
        "Since it is actually west, not east." The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.

        in position. The model explicitly states "Since it is actually west, not east"
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on directional analysis (west
        vs east). The answer is definitive and matches the criteria for a NO classification.

        a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that UW-Sheboygan is not east of
        The Ort Institute.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Wisconsin
        is located west of Illinois").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its directional analysis concluding that
        one location is west rather than east of the other.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE". This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about
        one of the locations.

        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't complete the comparison at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and explains that it cannot determine the
        positioning because one institution no longer exists independently. This is
        a case where the model rejects the premises of the question since one location
        no longer exists in its original form.

        is on 15th Street while Corcoran is on 17th Street - a clear difference in
        location. The NO is not due to the locations being equal/same/identical, but
        rather because Strayer is specifically determined to be west of Corcoran.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer. The model is

        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Strayer is WEST of Corcoran (indicating a difference in position), and this
        directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, indicating that Strayer
        is not east of Corcoran because it is west of it.

        Strayer (on 15th St) is west of Corcoran (on 17th St), not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        UPMC Shadyside was explicitly stated to be west of American College of the
        Building Arts, indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot answer this
        question with a definitive YES or NO" and rejects the premise since one institution
        appears to be fictional. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria
        where the model rejects the premises of the question.

        the locations were equal - it explicitly states that Belleville is west of
        Memphis, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on the fact
        that one location is west of the other, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Addison (Chamberlain)
        is west of Grayslake (College of Lake County), indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct geographical
        reasoning for why Chamberlain is not east of College of Lake County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Addison (Chamberlain)
        is west of Grayslake (College of Lake County), indicating a difference in
        location. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.

        impossibility rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question as logically
        impossible since one location is part of the other. While it reluctantly says
        "NO" when pressed, it explicitly states this "does not truly reflect the logical
        impossibility of the question." This rejection of the premise's validity makes
        this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't verify one
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT ANSWER" and
        explains it cannot verify the location of one of the institutions. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and rejects the premise because one location doesn't exist.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient information" and indicates it cannot verify
        one of the locations. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

    c7384bb4-9545-4f1c-8bc7-e992cd4bbfa1:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not cite equality of values as a reason for its response - it cited inability
        to compare due to one location being fictitious.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly rejects the premise
        by noting that Tri-Valley University appears to be fictitious and therefore
        cannot determine the geographic relationship. When a model rejects the premises
        or indicates it cannot determine the comparison, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Pfeiffer University being west of Florida National University), not because

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Missouri Southern State was explicitly stated to be west of Calvary University,
        indicating a difference in location. The model clearly states "Since it is
        west, not east, the answer is NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in its reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a clear directional comparison showing Missouri Southern State is west (not
        east) of Calvary University.

        \ being \"further west\" and providing different longitude coordinates (94.5\xB0\
        W vs 94.6\xB0W). The NO answer was based on this directional difference."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Missouri Southern
        State University is west of, not east of, Calvary University).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" and "The
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer, with a clear directional reasoning
        that Missouri Southern State University is west of (not east of) Calvary University.

        northwest of New College, indicating a difference in position, and this directional
        difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east-west positions of the two locations, providing a
        direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

    f30b2bd3-8a20-4812-a78f-71db0d2fe28b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that GCU
        is west of New College, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Grand Canyon University is west
        of New College"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Grand Canyon University is west (not east)
        of New College.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Brownsville is south of Oklahoma City) and uses this difference
        to conclude that Brownsville is NOT east of Oklahoma City. The NO is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis. The
        answer is definitive and explicitly stated.

        "Brownsville is also west of Oklahoma City" and concludes "Since UTB is west
        of OCU, it is NOT east of OCU". The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
