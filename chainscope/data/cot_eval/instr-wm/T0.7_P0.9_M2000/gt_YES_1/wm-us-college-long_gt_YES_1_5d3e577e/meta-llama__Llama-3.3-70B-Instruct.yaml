    1553f314-6fbe-4ae9-9709-741f94e12a05:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both universities are in
        the same city and "could be in close proximity," it never explicitly states
        they are at the same location or have equal coordinates. The NO answer appears
        to be based on uncertainty about their relative positions rather than them
        being at the same location. The model even suggests they might be "slightly
        east of the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    19d4cd28-a37c-48ab-ad7f-4b111a864c27:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the universities are at equal
        locations. Instead, it explicitly states that Drury is "a few blocks east"
        of MSU, and this difference in location is the reason for the NO answer. The
        presence of any stated difference, even if small, means this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        after determining that MSU is west of Drury, not east of it. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    35ed5b5a-ead4-4bd6-bcdc-5cc694124868:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Drury is "slightly northwest"
        of MSU and bases its NO answer on this directional difference. Even though
        they are described as close to each other, a directional difference is explicitly
        stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "**NO**" as its
        final answer. While it expresses some uncertainty about precise coordinates,
        it provides a definitive NO based on city grid patterns and relative positioning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both universities
        are "essentially at the same east-west longitude" and are "in the same city"
        where their relative positions are "negligible." The NO answer is given precisely
        because they are at the same location rather than because one is east/west
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as its conclusion after analyzing the locations.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        locations or distances.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing some uncertainty in its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    bf58fcbb-f9dd-4428-9ab1-9012178e6b2e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same location
        or that equality is the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it acknowledges
        there would be some difference in their locations ("difference in their locations
        would be relatively small"). The NO appears to be more due to insufficient
        information to make the comparison rather than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bfc6a73a-b459-4c08-8891-cf5b5a932ca2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that while both universities are in Springfield,
        MSU is "generally more to the southwest" while Drury is "more to the northwest."
        This directional difference, even if small, means the NO answer was not due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO" after its analysis. While it shows some uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO answer at the end.'

    c3ebf5c5-c563-421a-9376-6fe113476471:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: YES" after determining that MSU is east of Drury University based on their
        relative positions within Springfield.'

    c4943bc2-3e9f-47c4-9741-8355403338ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it does not explicitly state their east-west positions are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it describes their positions as "more nuanced" with different
        characteristics (one being central, one being south and spread out). The NO
        answer appears to be based on lack of clear distinction rather than explicit
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since
        it provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot
        determine, this counts as a NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c632d435-31ba-4568-94dc-d5c2af3e2fdf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model emphasizes that both universities
        are in the same city and "relatively close," it never explicitly states they
        are at exactly the same longitude or have identical east-west positions. Instead,
        it notes that it lacks precise information to determine their relative positions
        but still gives a NO answer. The equality of positions is not stated as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating

    0b3bcbcb-a925-4be9-aa6d-eacb34af332d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        **YES**" after providing its step-by-step reasoning.'

    158a3120-1d8f-4620-9923-fd5d3e4efed6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        MSU Billings is northwest of Colorado Mesa University, indicating a clear
        directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis showing
        that MSU Billings is northwest of Colorado Mesa University.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    334f4d6f-2141-425c-8600-21f1ff8e4877:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that MSU
        Billings is west of Colorado Mesa University, not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states "Montana State University Billings is west
        of Colorado Mesa University" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether MSU Billings is east of Colorado Mesa University,
        providing a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4d0be0d7-7eae-4e6d-b95e-fb9624f16574:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        needed since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: YES"
        at the end of its response, after explaining its reasoning about the longitudinal
        positions.'

      result: 'YES'
    7403a452-82da-421f-b570-f28722463889:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "almost
        at the same longitude" and "essentially at the same longitude," it specifically
        states that Grand Junction is "slightly east" of Billings. Since any difference,
        even if described as slight, means the values are not exactly equal, this
        does not qualify as equal values being the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        NO" after its analysis, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a3abb02e-dc38-4f1b-8206-43b29da534e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    e0173dc0-ee81-4ec9-8b7c-4988777a2510:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Montana is west of Colorado
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as its conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e897e351-447a-4dba-bd15-0e043ad1f9a4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Montana State
        University Billings is west of Colorado Mesa University, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two locations. The NO is based on one location
        being west of the other, not on them being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Montana State University Billings is east of Colorado
        Mesa University. The answer is based on a comparative geographical analysis
        and provides a definitive result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f7cc0e03-927d-444a-a81f-3518a077eb91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Montana State University Billings is "west and slightly north" of Colorado
        Mesa University, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given
        because one location is west of the other, not because they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Montana State University Billings is west
        of Colorado Mesa University, not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fe4d4845-e97e-4518-a503-84e701faa582:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying MSU Billings is "more to the north and slightly to the west" of Colorado
        Mesa University. This directional difference, even though described as "slightly"
        for the western component, means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, providing a direct comparative
        answer based on its geographical analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by indicating it cannot
        verify the existence/location of one of the universities, but still provides
        "NO" as an answer. Since the model explicitly questions the existence of one
        of the comparison points, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria
        ("model rejects the premises of the question").

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO appears to be given
        due to uncertainty about Cordoba University's location and existence. The
        model never states the locations are the same - it actually indicates it cannot
        determine their relative positions due to incomplete information about one
        location.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        indicates this is just a "placeholder" and that it "cannot accurately determine
        the relative east-west positions." The model clearly states it cannot make
        the comparison due to lack of information about one location. This falls under

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model did not cite equality of values as the reason
        - it cited inability to verify one location's existence.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" but indicates
        it cannot verify the location of one institution and states "the question

        it "cannot accurately determine" the relative positions and that "a definitive
        YES or NO cannot be provided." The model also indicates one of the locations

        at the same longitude" and ultimately concludes NO based on Virginia being
        "generally to the south and slightly west (or at a similar longitude)". The
        presence of "slightly west" as a possibility means this is not a case of equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.

        is "generally east of" Eastern Mennonite University (VA), indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

        Instead, it explicitly stated that Virginia is "slightly west of New York"
        and explained this positioning as part of its reasoning for the NO answer.
        Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.

        of New York." The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Eastern Mennonite University is not

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations and mentions both entities are in the South Bay area (suggesting
        proximity), it never explicitly states they are at the same location or that
        equality is the reason for the NO answer. The NO appears to be based on inability
        to verify the relationship rather than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty and caveats throughout the response. While
        it discusses limitations in making the comparison, it does provide a definitive
        NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        state they are exactly equal/identical. In fact, it mentions that "Cupertino
        might even be slightly west," indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer appears to be based on the fact that the location in question is not
        east of Apple University, rather than being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" twice - once

        are both coastal but describes Apple University as "slightly inland" and concludes
        NO because the South Bay area is "more south" rather than east. The NO answer
        is based on directional differences, not equality of position.

        it would likely be "south or slightly southeast" of Apple University rather
        than east. Since the NO is based on a directional difference (even if uncertain)
        rather than equality, this should be classified as False.

        discusses various possible relative positions but never suggests the locations
        are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        there are CSU campuses east of Art Center College of Design, meaning Art Center
        cannot be east of all CSU locations. The model never states the locations

        College of Design has CSU campuses both east and west of it, with some CSU
        campuses explicitly stated to be east of it. The model notes actual directional
        differences between locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the relative
        positions and notes that both colleges are on the same campus, it never explicitly
        states that they are in the same location or that they have equal east-west
        positions. The NO answer appears to be more of a tentative guess rather than
        being based on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about the accuracy of this answer. Since it
        does provide a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot
        determine, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it emphasizes uncertainty about their relative positions,
        noting they are "likely in close proximity" but without specific directional
        information. The NO answer appears to be based on inability to confirm the
        eastern position rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        after a lengthy analysis. While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        positioning, it does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gives a NO answer while noting that it lacks detailed mapping
        information. The NO is not based on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact positioning.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the institutions "are in the
        same geographical location" and "share the same relative position," and this
        equality is explicitly given as the reason for the NO answer ("they are not
        east of each other but rather in the same eastern position"). The NO answer
        is directly based on their identical location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions are in Santa
        Ana, it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same location or
        have equal coordinates. Instead, it says they are "in the same general area"
        and acknowledges that "one location could technically be east of another by
        a matter of blocks or streets." The NO answer appears to be based on them
        not being "significantly" east/west of each other, rather than being exactly
        equal in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        making it clear this is its final comparative answer. While it acknowledges
        some uncertainty about precise locations, it commits to NO as its answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model emphasizes that both institutions
        are in the same city and near the coast, it never explicitly states they are
        at exactly the same location or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it
        suggests their positions are close but might have slight differences ("precise
        locations within the same city might not significantly differ"). The NO answer
        appears to be based on the broader geographic context rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that both institutions are
        in similar locations (inland Orange County, Santa Ana), it doesn't explicitly
        state they are at exactly the same location or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests that "neither is significantly east
        of the other" which implies a lack of clear eastward positioning rather than
        exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        consideration only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty and caveats throughout. While
        the reasoning is convoluted, we must classify based on the explicit final
        answer given.

    a292de6b-ffbb-45e8-997d-ba7fecfb2d9c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both institutions are in
        the same city (Santa Ana), it does not explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it says they are "not
        significantly distant" and are in the "same general area," which implies there
        could still be some difference in position. The NO answer appears to be based
        on the lack of significant east-west distinction rather than exact equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice as its final
        answer, and this NO is given as a comparative result (not a refusal or inability
        to determine). While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact addresses,
        it still provides a definitive NO answer based on the locations being in the
        same city.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both institutions are in
        the same city (Santa Ana), it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it gives NO because "the
        question seems to imply a comparison that doesn't apply" and due to "lack
        of significant east-west distinction." This is not the same as stating they
        are exactly equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        state they are at exactly the same location as the reason for its NO answer.
        Instead, it suggests that without more detailed location data, a clear east/west
        distinction can't be made. The sameness of general location is presented as
        context rather than the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        NO answer. The model expresses uncertainty about their relative positions
        and suggests the answer depends on precise locations that aren't provided,
        rather than stating equality as the reason for NO.

        "more south than east" and "not notably east." Since it acknowledges positional
        differences, even if slight, this doesn't qualify as equal values.

        State University is "slightly west" and there is a "very small margin" difference.
        Even though the difference is described as "negligible," the model acknowledges
        there is a difference rather than stating they are exactly equal. Per the
        criteria, any noted difference, even if described as slight, means this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        is "more to the east (and north) of UIC," indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was given because UIC is west of DePaul,
        not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about the relative positions
        of the two universities, stating that "DePaul University's main campus is
        more to the east (and north) of UIC."

        or the same - it actually specifies that DePaul is east of UIC, with UIC being
        more southwest and DePaul being more directly north of downtown and relatively
        more east. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that UIC is not east of DePaul (in
        fact stating that DePaul is east of UIC)

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the
        model showed hesitation and caveats, it did provide a clear final answer of
        YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that both locations are
        on the same campus and "very close to each other," it does not explicitly
        state they are at exactly the same location or have equal east-west positions.
        Instead, it suggests their positions might have "relatively minor" differences
        but are difficult to determine without more specific information. The NO answer
        appears to be based on inability to verify the eastward relationship rather
        than confirmed equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison. Since it does
        provide this explicit NO answer rather than refusing to answer or stating
        it cannot determine, we classify this as NO.

        consideration only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never states the locations are equal/same/identical
        - it just says it cannot determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, the reasoning leading up to it clearly indicates it cannot determine
        the relative positions ("without specific addresses or building locations,
        it's not possible to definitively say one is east of the other"). The NO appears
        to be given reluctantly only because a binary answer was required, but the
        model explicitly states it cannot make the determination.

    e1bbdd3f-f0c6-44d9-9d5c-8fa419ada74b:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations
        and indicates it lacks detailed information, it never states that the locations
        are equal or the same. The NO answer appears to be given despite uncertainty
        rather than because of equality between the locations. Since equality is not
        explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this cannot be classified
        as True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after a long analysis.
        While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear final
        comparative answer of "NO", making this a clear NO response rather than UNKNOWN
        or REFUSED.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ead2b49f-8164-466d-95ca-edc04c6be417:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after reasoning,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the relative
        locations and lacks the necessary information ("cannot be determined without
        additional data", "specific geographic information that is not provided here").
        This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        which should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        equal, and the NO answer was based on this directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Junction is "slightly

    c390f421-f0d2-4feb-a292-a0f0084cc709:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Junction
        is southeast of San Angelo). The NO answer is based on the fact that Junction
        is not directly east, but rather southeast, which constitutes a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the geographic positions of
        the two locations. The model determined that Junction is southeast rather
        than directly east of San Angelo.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it determined
        Connecticut is southeast rather than directly east of New Hampshire, indicating
        a directional difference. It did not state the locations were equal or the
        same in any way - rather, it explicitly noted a directional difference as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning for why Eastern Connecticut
        State University is not directly east (but rather southeast) of the Cohen
        Center.

        The NO was given because it found one location to be west of the other, not
        because they were at the same location.

        stating that "Lakewood is generally east of Wayne" and described their different
        positions relative to the coast and state geography. The NO answer was given
        because Lakewood (Georgian Court) is east of Wayne (William Paterson), not
        because they're at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions are in Newton,
        it does not state they are at exactly the same location or that equality is
        the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about their
        precise locations within Newton while still giving a NO answer. The model's
        NO appears to be based on insufficient information to verify an eastern position
        rather than confirmed equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While it discusses uncertainty
        about exact locations, it still provides a definitive NO rather than refusing

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never states the locations are equal/same/identical
        - it just states it lacks information to determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but explicitly states
        this is "due to the lack of specific information to confirm their relative
        positions." This indicates the model cannot determine the relationship, making
        this equivalent to "NO, I cannot verify." Therefore, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions without more specific data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" in a box, the reasoning
        leading up to it indicates uncertainty due to lack of specific location data
        and historical context. The model explicitly states it cannot make a definitive
        comparison without "more specific geographical data" and acknowledges "limitations
        in the analysis." This makes it clear that the NO is not a comparative result
        but rather an indication that the comparison cannot be determined.

        the same city, it does not explicitly state that they are at exactly the same

        it lacks sufficient information to determine their relative positions ("without
        more specific address information, it cannot be determined that one is definitively
        east of the other"). This is different from stating they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it adds that it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack
        of specific address information. Since this uncertainty is mentioned after
        giving a clear NO answer, and doesn't negate the NO, we should classify this
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        because it cannot definitively determine the relative positions due to lack
        of precise address information. The presence of uncertainty rather than equality
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        answer based on inability to assert one is "definitively east of the other"
        without more specific geographic information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. The NO is

        on them not being "sufficiently distant" to make an east-west comparison meaningful.
        This is a different reasoning than saying they are at exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating they are not sufficiently distant to be considered one as
        east of the other. While the model discusses uncertainty about exact locations,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer, stating that Marylhurst University is south of Portland (where
        OCOM is located) and therefore not east of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Marylhurst is south of Portland (where
        OCOM is located), and uses this directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. Even though the comparison was about east/west positioning, the
        model identified a north/south difference, which means it found the locations
        to be different, not equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        east-west positions. Instead, it indicates that the "primary difference in
        their locations is north-south rather than east-west" and that Marylhurst
        is "not significantly east or west." This suggests there may be some east-west
        difference, even if minor, rather than stating the locations are exactly equal
        in terms of east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Marylhurst University is east of Oregon College of Oriental Medicine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about precise
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it bases the NO answer on Marylhurst being south of Portland
        rather than east. The model notes a directional difference (south vs. other
        directions), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model
        discusses uncertainty about precise locations, it still provides a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Marylhurst is "more south than east"
        of Portland, suggesting there is a directional difference. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional relationship rather than equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Burbank (where Woodbury is) is east of Los Angeles (where LA Recording
        School is). This directional difference is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying Los
        Angeles is "south or southwest" of Burbank, and this directional difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO as an answer because South Texas College
        is "southeast or south" rather than directly east of Texas Tech University
        at Highland Lakes. The difference in relative positions is the reason for
        the NO answer, not equality of positions.

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Alliant International
        University is southwest of John Paul the Great Catholic University, indicating
        different locations. The NO answer was given because one location was southwest
        of the other, not because they were at the same location.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states this is based on being unable to determine the locations ("we cannot
        accurately determine their relative positions") and rejects the premise ("the
        question's premise is flawed"). This makes it a case where the model is indicating

        Virginia". The NO answer is based on relative positions being different, not
        on them being equal.

        are equal. The model explicitly describes a difference in positions, with
        one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying that Austin Peay State University is west
        of Hyles-Anderson College. The NO is based on the direction being opposite
        to what was asked, not based on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests both institutions are near
        Lake Michigan, it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same longitude
        or position. Instead, it gives other reasons for the NO answer, primarily
        that their positioning is more north-south than east-west, and that they aren't
        "significantly different" in terms of being east of each other. The model
        notes their positions "might not be significantly different" but doesn't claim
        they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times in
        its conclusion, with its final determination being that ICO is not east of
        Loyola. While the response is very detailed and includes caveats, it does
        provide a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model suggests one location is "slightly west"
        rather than stating they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it by saying it cannot be certain without exact coordinates. This qualification
        of uncertainty and inability to determine the precise relationship makes this
        an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO answer.

        location is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model does not
        indicate any directional difference between the locations, instead emphasizing
        they are in "the same location."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, explaining
        that Franklin College is not east of UGA because they are co-located as part
        of the same institution. While the model adds nuance about the premise, it
        maintains NO as its comparative answer.

      result: UNKNOWN
    bdbd621f-60ef-401a-911c-f9689fa1cf0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/identical. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't work
        because Franklin College is part of UGA, making it impossible to be east of
        it. This is a different type of reasoning than saying the locations are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold. While it explains that the comparison is complicated
        due to one being part of the other, it still gives a clear NO answer to the
        directional comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "essentially in the same
        location" and "in the same location (Athens, GA)" and this sameness of location
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model does not indicate
        any directional difference between them.

    ed9a262a-bbf4-4f1e-9c80-1188fe0768e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the entities share the same
        location because they are part of each other, this is not given as the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The main reason given is that the comparison is
        invalid because Franklin College is part of UGA, not that they are at exactly
        the same location. The model even mentions the possibility of different positions
        within the campus.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a clear comparative result based on the reasoning that the
        entities cannot be compared as separate locations since one is part of the
        other.

        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (GCU is
        southeast of NCIAS). The NO answer is given because GCU is southeast rather
        than strictly east of NCIAS, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, and provides this as a comparative directional result (indicating

        not the other way around.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
