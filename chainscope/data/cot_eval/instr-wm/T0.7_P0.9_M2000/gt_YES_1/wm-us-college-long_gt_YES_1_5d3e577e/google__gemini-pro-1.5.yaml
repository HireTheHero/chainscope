    17766b2c-a5f0-4834-a526-5e700391b5ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it does not state they are at exactly the same location. Instead,
        it suggests they might be adjacent or one might be slightly northeast/southeast
        of the other. The NO answer is based on the reasoning that one cannot be strictly
        east of the other, not because they are at exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    37fbb411-0537-4478-b395-0c1a0131e9eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states the universities are "in the
        same city," it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        or have equal coordinates. Being in the same city doesn't necessarily mean
        equal positions - one could still be slightly east of the other within the
        city limits. The model's reasoning is that they're in the same city, not that
        they have identical locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after determining that the universities are in the same city.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    869f5581-f2c1-4e3e-ba1d-be9dde0cb5ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the universities are "very close"
        and in the "same city," it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the
        same longitude or position. Instead, it describes their positions as having
        "small variations" that are "negligible" but present. Since any difference,
        even if described as small, means they're not exactly equal, this doesn't
        qualify as a NO due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparative question, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8df3bac5-9dbe-4943-8be2-41ef9c16c076:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "very close together"
        and "practically in the same location," it also acknowledges that "One might
        be slightly east or west of the other." Since it admits the possibility of
        a slight difference rather than stating they are exactly equal, this does
        not meet the criteria for a NO based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    95d40f93-ecab-4f0c-b2a7-906bcbc8f799:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both universities are in the
        same city and concludes "neither is east of the other." This indicates they
        are effectively at the same location/longitude, and this equality is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that neither university is east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    9ed388f1-e85b-4c4c-bbe1-e23846b61e18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both universities are in the
        same city and their relative east/west location is "essentially negligible,"
        but it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location. In
        fact, it acknowledges that "One might be slightly east or west of the other."
        Since it admits there might be a slight difference, even if deemed insignificant,
        this doesn't qualify as stating they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b913ee17-9c20-452f-922c-850d0f80e0bb:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "in the same city" and "cannot
        be meaningfully east of the other," which implies they are effectively in
        the same location. This equality of location is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that one university is not east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    c6831f9e-02b6-4dac-b6df-de9507b79d89:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "in the same city" and uses
        this as the reason why "one cannot be EAST of the other." While this implies
        they're in the same location, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly/approximately
        the same coordinates or longitude. Being in the same city doesn't necessarily
        mean identical locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that one university is not east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d6f9357e-b3be-408d-89f6-6d05cd3e5765:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on both universities
        being in the same city and therefore neither being strictly east/west of the
        other - effectively stating they share the same relative east/west position.
        This equality in position was the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after reasoning about the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    daa113d5-2635-419e-b1c0-c645e6be966a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both universities are in
        the same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location
        or have equal coordinates. The reason given for NO is that being in the same
        city means one cannot be "strictly east" of the other, which is different
        from saying they're at the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether one university is east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
  0786696d3e188e6f4afd7f528c1c8e1b41e5ca51151a8b38b0ebeba2ccd47720:
    01d6fb6d-8eb6-47b3-90ad-3bd73be1ec70:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (that Montana is west of Colorado due to Earth's curvature). Even though this
        reasoning may be questionable, the model is clearly indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2193a713-06ca-4cb1-98db-1d8d2187a2d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, explaining
        that Billings, MT cannot be east of any location in Colorado due to their
        relative positions. The answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2cd004f1-f94f-45db-b10d-c8b663a3ac2c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after laying out its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    846e7890-88f5-4813-97f4-21782a72ca1d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Rather, it's based on the reasoning that Montana
        is directly north of Colorado, implying a purely north-south relationship
        with no east-west component. The model is not stating the longitudes are equal,
        just that the relationship is purely north-south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a direct response to the question of whether one location
        is east of the other. The model is not refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty
        - it's making a clear negative comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    95411e72-9253-485c-835b-40b8fb50c4d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that MSU Billings cannot be
        east of CMU because Montana is north of Colorado, indicating a different geographical
        relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a4fa8b28-f614-4938-a862-fff61fefaf51:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the locations
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a9de5b0e-43a0-44d0-a6d3-6771acee22a8:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ca32ea29-4ac8-4f83-b8a5-5e5292ce0d40:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that Montana cannot
        be east of Colorado due to their relative positions. The answer was based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning about geographical positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e3322fd2-b51b-4bed-b5f6-86fb480cbc9f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Billings is "much
        further west than any part of Colorado," indicating a clear difference in
        location. The NO appears to be rejecting some unstated premise about eastern
        positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats
        about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fc659d54-0d65-4632-a863-9efa5fe46010:

        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step reasoning'
      final_answer: 'YES'

    24ec0165-4727-4499-9f1b-88acb94e6dab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Cannot be determined
        based on available information" and rejects the premise by noting that one
        of the universities is fictional. While it mentions what the answer would
        be if comparing to Cordoba, Spain, that's not the actual question being asked.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5c918d80-95f4-46e8-99a5-c01ce551be3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step reasoning'

    7191e9fd-c260-4ba3-921a-eb82cb26740c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model never claimed the locations were
        equal - it stated it couldn't locate one of them to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains that it cannot determine relative positions because one location
        cannot be found. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b8da2665-b3d0-441a-8a88-c7386fef0176:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location was unknown
        because the university doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but also indicates that one of the universities (Cordoba) doesn't exist and
        that it's "impossible to determine the relative locations." When a model rejects
        the premises of the question by stating one entity doesn't exist, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN regardless of the stated NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c496f350-4833-4e71-baa7-e981722d0b12:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is not relevant
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly stated "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, even though it had to make an assumption about one location.'

    d552b1f0-ad35-4bc2-a1bb-97228cb05a96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it had to make an assumption about one of the locations (replacing
        Cordoba with Liberty University)

    e6142c08-8e15-427d-9e3c-727e64ad54ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Cordoba, VA is east of Fort Lee, and concludes
        that Army Logistics University is west of the hypothetical Cordoba University.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, with no caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. While it notes one institution is hypothetical, it proceeds with
        the comparison using the town location and reaches a definitive conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f078839c-dec8-469d-a610-b55474215ae4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because the question is based
        on a false premise)" and rejects the premise by stating one university doesn't
        exist. When a model rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "Harrisonburg, VA is west
        of Buffalo, NY". The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical comparison step by step.

        or west of the other" and that they are "in the same general area," which
        implies they are in approximately the same location. This equality is presented
        as the primary reason for the NO answer, with no mention of any directional
        difference, even slight ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and while it notes that one location doesn't exist, this
        comes as part of the reasoning rather than the conclusion. The NO is stated
        clearly and definitively as the final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it argues that since Apple is within the
        South Bay, nothing in the South Bay can be east of it. This is a logical argument
        about relative positioning, not about equality of locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their positions because
        one location appears to be hypothetical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one location is hypothetical and therefore impossible to determine.
        This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question, making it an UNKNOWN
        rather than a definitive NO comparison.

        are equal. Instead, it specifically stated that Sunnyvale is "northwest of
        Cupertino," indicating a directional difference between the locations. Any
        directional difference, even if slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        (stating that Austin is west of Enid), not because the locations are at the
        same position. Since it indicates a difference in position (even if factually
        incorrect), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct

        and west), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for NO is that "both colleges
        are on the same campus, one cannot be strictly east of the other." This explicitly
        indicates they are in the same location, and this equality of location is
        the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        of the same campus" and "in close proximity," it doesn't explicitly state
        they are at exactly the same location. Instead, it suggests they likely share
        buildings and aren't in a true east-west orientation, which implies some spatial
        difference, even if complex.

        same campus, it doesn't state they are at exactly the same location. Instead,
        it explains they might be adjacent, interspersed, or one might surround the
        other. The NO answer is based on the impossibility of one being entirely east
        of the other due to their complex spatial relationship, not because they occupy
        exactly the same space.

        in the same location" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its
        NO answer. It explicitly argues that they cannot be meaningfully distinguished
        in terms of east/west orientation because they share the same location on
        campus.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it doesn't state that
        the locations are exactly equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that
        they are part of the same campus and that one cannot be strictly east of the
        other, with possible adjacent or overlapping positions. This is a different
        reason than exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model explains that both colleges are on
        the same campus, it doesn't state they are equal/identical/the same as its
        reason for NO. Instead, it explains that directional terms become ambiguous
        and cannot be applied when entities are dispersed within the same area. The
        NO is based on the inability to establish a directional relationship, not
        because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining that directional relationships don't apply between
        these colleges since they are on the same campus.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that the
        colleges are "part of the same university and in the same city" and "cannot
        be east or west of each other in a meaningful geographic sense." This indicates
        they are effectively in the same location, making this a case where the NO
        answer is due to equal geographic positioning.

        explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical/the same. The mention of
        a "negligible" difference still implies some difference exists, even if tiny.
        Per the guidelines, even slight differences should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifiers that would make it an UNKNOWN (like "cannot verify"

        entity is part of the other and therefore cannot be east of itself. This is
        a logical impossibility argument rather than an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the logical impossibility
        of something being east of itself.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        values/locations are equal. Rather, it's because one location is part of the
        other, making a directional comparison logically impossible. The model doesn't
        state that the locations are the same/equal/identical - it states that one
        is part of the other and therefore can't be directionally compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the logical reasoning that
        something cannot be directionally related to itself.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes that the locations are the
        same (since one is part of the other), this is not presented as a case of
        equal values being compared. Instead, the NO answer is based on the logical
        impossibility of something being east of itself. The model's reasoning is
        about logical impossibility rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is given as a comparative result based on the logical
        reasoning that something cannot be east of itself.

        other, making directional comparison impossible. The model doesn't state they
        are at the same location/coordinates, but rather that the logical premise
        of the comparison is invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the logical reasoning that
        something cannot be directionally compared to itself.

        of the other and "cannot be east of itself," it does not explicitly state
        that they are at the exact same location or have equal coordinates as the
        reason for the NO answer. The reasoning is about logical impossibility rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a logical explanation that something cannot be east
        of itself.

        values/locations are equal. Rather, it's because one location is part of the
        other, making directional comparison impossible. The model argues that something
        cannot be directionally compared to itself, which is different from saying
        two things are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes that the locations cannot
        be compared because they are the same entity (one is part of the other), this
        is not the same as stating they have equal coordinate values. The model's
        reasoning is based on logical impossibility ("cannot be east of itself") rather
        than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        difference, saying that Marian University (WI) is west of Bethel University
        (TN).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

        is west of Bethel University, TN" before giving its NO answer. Even though
        this seems contradictory with the final NO, we must take the response at face
        value and note that equality was not given as the reason for the NO.

        its NO answer, saying "One cannot be east of the other" because they are in
        the same place.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they were "in the same city" and
        concludes that "one cannot be east of the other" - this indicates the NO answer
        is based on their locations being the same/identical, making them neither
        east nor west of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether one location is east of the other.

    5232e458-6dca-4de8-93cd-7e19790015bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the institutions were in
        the same city, it doesn't explicitly state they had identical coordinates
        or that equality was the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests they
        had different addresses within the same city and that the difference wasn't
        "meaningful" enough to make an east/west comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that the institutions were in the same city and couldn't be meaningfully east
        or west of each other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both universities are "in the
        same city" and concludes "neither is east of the other." This indicates they
        are at the same location/longitude, and this equality is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that neither location is east of the other
        since they are in the same city.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both institutions are located
        in the same city (Lincoln, Illinois), it doesn't explicitly state that they
        are at exactly/approximately the same longitude or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer. The model simply states that being in the same city means
        one cannot be east of the other, which is a different logical argument than
        stating they have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lincoln Christian University is east of Lincoln College.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because the institutions
        are in the same city, effectively stating they are in the same location. The
        model explicitly states they "cannot be east or west of each other in any
        meaningful sense" because they share the same location, making this a case
        where equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that the institutions are in the same city and cannot be meaningfully compared
        in terms of east/west positioning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO because both institutions
        are in the same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the
        same longitude or location. Being in the same city doesn't necessarily mean
        identical coordinates, and the model doesn't claim they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

        this difference to conclude NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, based
        on Newton being west of Boston rather than east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - specifically
        that Vermont is directly north of Connecticut, not east or west, so one location
        cannot be east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are not exactly equal, this cannot be classified as equal values being the
        reason for the NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that while there might be "slight
        variations," Virginia is "not significantly east of Pennsylvania." Since it
        acknowledges variations and bases its answer on a lack of significant eastward
        difference rather than equality, this does not qualify as an equality-based
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that McAllen is "slightly west" of
        Marble Falls, indicating a small but real difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on the locations being equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.

        McAllen is "significantly west of" Marble Falls. This difference in position
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal
        or inability to determine.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that McAllen is "significantly south
        and east of Marble Falls," indicating a clear difference in location. This
        difference in position is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any caveats or qualifications about inability to determine
        or verify. It provides a clear comparative analysis leading to this NO conclusion.

        premise. The model does not mention equality as a reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it described relative positions with Mississippi being east of Missouri,
        and concluded with NO. The reasoning suggests different positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually makes a directional claim (that Mississippi
        is west of Missouri) but concludes NO. While this may seem illogical, we must
        evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not correctness.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it arrives at NO because it determines that Mississippi
        is "generally west of Missouri" and therefore Jackson State University is
        west of Saint Louis University (though this geographic reasoning is actually
        incorrect, it's what the model stated).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it noted that Mississippi is "generally west of Missouri"
        and gave NO as the answer. The response indicates a directional difference
        (even if factually incorrect), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Kentucky is west of
        Georgia, indicating a difference in longitude (even if slight). The model
        explicitly states "Kentucky is west of Georgia" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

    1df06bcf-8870-4ffd-ae79-2f6c792eedac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Winchester being "further west" than the Georgia locations), not
        because the locations are at equal longitudes. Since it identifies a directional
        difference, even if the actual difference might be small, this does not qualify
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Winchester, KY is
        further west than the Georgia locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference ("Kentucky is generally west of Georgia" and
        "Winchester, KY is west of both Americus, GA and Cordele, GA").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kentucky is "north and west
        of Georgia" and that "Winchester, KY is west of both Americus and Cordele,
        GA." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it concluded NO because it determined Winchester, KY is west of Americus,
        GA. The model explicitly noted a directional difference ("Kentucky is generally
        west of Georgia" and "Winchester, KY is likely west of Americus, GA").

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it found Kentucky is west of Georgia,
        indicating a difference in position. The model did not state or suggest the
        locations were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        instead, it explicitly stated that Kentucky is west of Georgia and concluded
        Southeastern Christian College is west of South Georgia Technical College.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        the other in the broad sense" and notes they are both in Spokane, it does
        not explicitly state they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
        Instead, it specifically mentions "they must be located in different parts
        of the city," indicating some difference in location.

        (Gonzaga is west of WSU Spokane). The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Gonzaga is slightly west of
        the WSU Spokane campus," indicating a directional difference between the locations,
        even if small. Since it notes this difference rather than equality as the
        basis for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

        difference, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it describes different relative positions (Gonzaga in
        central part, WSU north of river) and concludes Gonzaga is west of WSU. The
        NO answer appears to be based on directional differences, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location.
        Instead, it suggests they could be "adjacent, north/south, or interspersed"
        - implying they are at different locations within the city. The NO answer
        is based on rejecting the possibility of an east-west relationship, not because
        of exact location equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a direct response to the comparison question rather than
        a statement about inability to determine or verify.

        and "in very close proximity," it does not explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The model
        actually suggests one could be east, west, north, or south of the other, implying
        some difference in location exists.

        in Spokane while the other was just "in the state." However, it does not explicitly
        state they are in the same/equal location as the reason for its NO answer.
        Instead, it simply concludes that "one cannot be EAST of the other" without
        specifically citing equality of location as the reason.

        due to the relative positions of their states. The NO appears to be based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that "Anything in Arkansas will be west of
        anything in Wisconsin." This indicates a difference in position, not equality,
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that while Bemidji State is north of Northwest
        Missouri State, it's "not far enough east" to be east of northwestern Missouri.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining why Bemidji State University is not east of Northwest Missouri
        State University. This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Bemidji State is primarily north of
        Northwest Missouri State, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Minnesota being west of Missouri), not because the locations are at the same
        longitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with Minnesota being west of Missouri.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that since Minnesota is west of Missouri, Bemidji State cannot
        be east of Northwest Missouri State.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Bemidji is much further west
        than the northwestern corner of Missouri," indicating a clear difference in
        position. This difference, not equality, is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 4, and this is presented as a direct comparative result
        rather than a statement about inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Bemidji State University
        cannot be east of Northwest Missouri State University because of its geographical
        position (being in Minnesota, north of Missouri). The model indicates there
        is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining why Bemidji State University cannot be east of Northwest
        Missouri State University. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (southeast vs east). The NO is because being "southeast" doesn't qualify as
        being "east"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that while Dharma Realm Buddhist University is southeast
        of Cal Poly Humboldt, it is "not directly east"

        the same position or equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is south-southeast of the other, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides directional reasoning to support this conclusion (stating
        DRBU is "NOT east of Cal Poly Humboldt")

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted that Ukiah is southeast of Arcata and gave the
        NO answer because being southeast is not the same as being strictly east.
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a clear directional comparison rather than
        a rejection of premises or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (southeast vs. east), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly notes that one location is southeast of the other, indicating
        they are not at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that while Ukiah is southeast of Arcata, this doesn't satisfy

        Michigan is west of Ohio, which implies the locations are different. The NO
        answer appears to be because the model concluded the premise was incorrect
        (Miami University would be east, not west, of Lake Superior State), not because
        the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a direct negative response to whether

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are "likely
        very close together" and "essentially at the same location," this is presented
        as a probability rather than a certainty. Additionally, the model explicitly
        states "technically one could be slightly east of the other" and bases its
        NO answer on the lack of precise information rather than on confirmed equality
        of positions. The NO is not primarily justified by proven equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While it
        expresses uncertainty about precise locations, it still provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference ("the International
        Residential College is located centrally on grounds, while the Center for
        Politics is slightly to the west"). The NO answer was based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/locations
        - it actually states there is a directional difference, specifically that
        Fergus Falls is west of both Thief River Falls and East Grand Forks. The NO
        appears to be because the direction is opposite to what was asked (west instead
        of east).

        the locations were equal - the model explicitly stated that Sheboygan is "slightly
        west" of Skokie, indicating a difference in position, even if small. Any stated
        difference, even if described as "slight," means this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly describes a directional difference,
        stating that "Sheboygan is generally west of Chicago/Skokie." Since it indicates
        a directional difference (even if potentially small), this cannot be classified
        as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Sheboygan being
        "north-northeast" of Skokie rather than directly east. The NO is based on
        this directional difference, not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative result based
        on its geographical analysis that Sheboygan is "not directly east" but rather
        "north-northeast" of Skokie.

        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly describes a directional difference,
        concluding that "Sheboygan is west of Skokie" and bases its NO answer on this
        directional relationship. Even though this seems to contradict its NO answer,
        we must take the stated directional difference at face value.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted a directional difference, stating
        that Clarksville, TN is west of Crown Point, IN. Even though this contradicts
        an earlier statement about Tennessee being east of Indiana, we must take the
        specific directional difference at face value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west vs east), not on the locations being equal. The model explicitly states
        Tennessee is "west of Indiana" and uses this difference to conclude NO. Even
        though the difference might be small, any stated directional difference means
        we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its reasoning that Tennessee (and thus
        Austin Peay) is west of Indiana (and thus Hyles-Anderson), not east as asked
        in the question.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Clarksville, TN is "slightly west" of Crown
        Point, IN. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated
        difference means this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Tennessee is west
        of Indiana and therefore Clarksville would be west of Crown Point. The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 and again as a final standalone answer. This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Pittsburgh
        is "significantly west of Charleston" - it identifies a clear directional
        difference rather than equality between the locations. The NO is due to this
        westward difference, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that UPMC Shadyside School of Nursing is not east of the
        American College of the Building Arts, since Pittsburgh is west of Charleston.

        or the same. Instead, it determined that WVU Tech is west of Lenoir-Rhyne,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the values being compared are equal/same/identical. Instead, it
        explains that West Virginia is entirely west of North Carolina, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly noted a directional difference, stating
        "West Virginia is generally west and slightly north of North Carolina." The
        NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning but was not based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that West Virginia
        University Institute of Technology is NOT west of Lenoir-Rhyne University,
        despite its reasoning suggesting otherwise.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that they
        are "both in the same city" and thus "cannot be meaningfully east of the other."
        While this implies they are in roughly the same location, the model does not
        explicitly state they are at exactly/approximately the same coordinates or
        longitude. The NO is based on being in the same city rather than having equal
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether one location is east of the other.

    25e8dbd0-c322-4b69-84e4-5d3737bcb3e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model implies the locations are close since
        they're in the same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal
        or identical in location. The phrase "cannot be significantly east" suggests
        there might be some small difference, just not a significant one. Since exact
        equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 3, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result
        rather than a rejection of premises or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        and "isn't significantly east," it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same location or longitude. The reasoning suggests proximity but not exact
        equality as the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after reasoning about the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both colleges are in the
        same city (Savannah), it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same
        location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests
        they could be "adjacent, across the street, or in different parts of the city"
        but just not in an east/west relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a comparative result (indicating one is not east of the
        other), not as an inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it states that it's "highly improbable that one specific
        location within a city is precisely due east of another." This suggests a
        geometric/directional reason rather than equality of positions. While both
        locations are in the same city, the model explicitly notes they could be "across
        the street," "a few blocks away," or "further" - indicating they are not in
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses reservations about the premise. While it discusses
        the flawed premise, it does provide a clear NO when "forced to provide a YES/NO
        answer."

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model noted a directional
        difference (slightly northeast), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not explicitly state that the locations
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it states they "can't be meaningfully
        'east' of the other" because they're in the same city. Being in the same city
        doesn't necessarily mean exact same location, and the model doesn't claim
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are in the same city, it
        doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location or have equal
        coordinates. Instead, it states that one "cannot be significantly east of
        the other," which implies there could still be some difference in location,
        just not a significant one.

        TN is west of Greenwood, SC - it explicitly states a directional difference
        ("it is still west of"). The NO is not based on the locations being equal
        or the same, but rather on finding a clear directional difference between
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations. The

        stating that Bristol is "west of Greenwood" and provides directional differences
        (Bristol being in northeastern TN while Greenwood is in western SC). The NO
        answer is based on these positional differences, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined NO based on the fact that Denton is north
        of Arlington, and that "North is not East" - indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES." after comparing the locations and determining that Denton
        is east of Arlington.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the longitudes were equal
        or the same. Instead, it noted that Denton is north of Arlington (indicating
        different locations), and this directional difference was the basis for its
        NO answer. The model did not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference, stating that
        Heidelberg is west of Western Carolina (since Ohio is west of North Carolina).
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one is west of the other, indicating
        a difference in location. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on a directional difference
        (Ohio being west of North Carolina), not because the locations were determined
        to be at the same longitude. The model explicitly indicated one was west of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to the question
        of whether Heidelberg University is east of Western Carolina University, providing
        a clear comparative answer based on its reasoning about Ohio being west of
        North Carolina.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it actually concludes that Arkansas is west of Iowa,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO answer appears to contradict its
        own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not
        logical consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Arkansas is "considerably west" of Iowa), not because the locations
        are at equal longitudes. The model explicitly indicates there is a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        that University of Central Arkansas is west (not east) of University of Northern
        Iowa.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it determined
        Arkansas is west of Iowa, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        It explicitly states a directional difference ("Arkansas is west of Iowa").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference in location, concluding
        that "Arkansas is west of Iowa." The NO answer appears to be incorrect given
        its own reasoning (which suggests it should have answered YES), but we must
        evaluate only what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning steps. This appears to be a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Arkansas is west
        of Iowa (indicating a difference in location), which contradicts its final
        NO answer but doesn't affect our classification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly stated that one location is west of the other, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO was given because the relationship is in
        the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        given for why one cannot be east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        of location is explicitly stated and is the basis for the NO answer (via the
        logic that something cannot be east of itself). This matches the criteria
        for True - the values (locations) are stated to be the same, and this sameness
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        location ("Something can't be east or west of itself"). This equality is explicitly
        stated and is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer,

        state they are "equal" or "the same" in terms of coordinates or position.
        Instead, it argues that the comparison is invalid because one is part of the
        other. This is a different logical basis than stating the values are equal.

        a logical impossibility argument rather than an equality of values argument.
        While they are at the same location (being on the same campus), the NO is

        the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Joplin is significantly
        west of Kansas City," indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer
        appears to be because the premise (asking if one is east when it's actually
        west) is false.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        since Nebraska is directly north of Kansas, Midland University cannot be east
        of Kansas State University. The NO is based on relative positioning, not equality
        of position.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Madera is not significantly
        east within California and is therefore unlikely to be east of a location
        in Washington. The answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer, but not because the
        locations are equal - it actually stated California is west of Washington
        and concluded Madera Community College is west of Heritage University. The
        NO appears to contradict the reasoning, but we must evaluate only what was
        explicitly stated without resolving contradictions.

        city and therefore "cannot be EAST of the other." While this implies they're
        in the same location, it doesn't explicitly state they have equal coordinates
        as the primary reason for the NO answer. The reasoning is more about them
        being parts of the same institution in the same city.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        institutions are in the same city (Athens, GA) and therefore neither can be
        east of the other - effectively stating they are in the same location. This
        equality in location is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both locations are in the
        same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location
        or have equal coordinates. The NO answer is based on the logical impossibility
        of one being strictly east of the other given they are parts of the same institution
        in the same city, not because they are at exactly the same point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation only
        applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    bdffd468-92bd-4976-9149-c540bbab4773:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations

    d0b27eed-e940-4ad1-ba99-b669182211a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, noting that
        "Grand Canyon University is generally west of the ASU West campus." Since
        it indicates a directional difference (even if potentially small), this cannot
        be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 3, and provides directional reasoning leading to this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dccb5a69-ead3-41c6-abf5-eba1be62fff6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after providing its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ee6c2823-3c5b-4227-897b-cf363fe87278:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning about the relative locations of the universities.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    0c78d94d-ea68-4470-b122-7f0270b54d1f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a difference, saying
        Brownsville is "significantly west" of Oklahoma City. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO
        response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated that Brownsville is "significantly west of Oklahoma
        City." The NO answer was based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer without any caveats or qualifications about inability
        to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3b920953-471b-43b0-a61f-8f7c1f3a497c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Brownsville is significantly
        further west than Oklahoma City" - it explicitly notes a difference in longitude
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the
        values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4509fc5a-ca21-4e51-a8d5-f0068a3365a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Brownsville being
        west of Oklahoma City, not because the locations have equal longitude values.
        In fact, the model explicitly states there is a difference in longitude ("Brownsville
        is further west than Oklahoma City").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Brownsville is west of Oklahoma City and therefore not
        east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4b7aadac-5786-4280-b673-09cd6c39fe37:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it explains that Brownsville is "primarily
        south, not significantly east" of Oklahoma City, indicating there is a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

    4c90e0ae-847e-4aed-97ce-7e3253a8e0d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Brownsville is "significantly
        west of Oklahoma City." The NO answer is given because Brownsville is west
        of Oklahoma City, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the relative positions.

      result: 'NO'
    7056ea2d-0c93-4e41-9cc2-bca88d642b9f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer after working through the relative positions step-by-step.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    98bf47b7-c2c0-44b8-81c3-d05148affff8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model states that Brownsville is west
        of Oklahoma City, indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly concludes
        that "Brownsville, TX is *not* east of Oklahoma City, OK." This is a direct
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a9b5c2f0-f012-4bab-bf5d-5c74d2a18de1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that Brownsville is "significantly south and
        slightly west" of Oklahoma City. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the cities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ac489229-977f-484c-98a3-998709f579ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Brownsville... is south and
        slightly west of Oklahoma City." Since it explicitly notes a directional difference
        (slightly west), even though small, this is not a case of equal values being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
