    2114fda0-a6ea-4167-a2be-f44ca6a61ad1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" multiple
        times, including in its final answer. It provides coordinates and explains
        why Missouri State (-93.2815) is east of Drury (-93.2928).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Drury is east of Missouri State (on Benton
        Ave) and Missouri State is west of Drury (on National Ave). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a specific directional
        explanation that Missouri State is west of Drury, not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and reinforced
        this with a final bolded "**Answer:** YES". Despite earlier uncertainty and
        contradictions in its reasoning, it arrived at a clear YES answer based on
        comparing longitude coordinates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of declaring the locations equal, as it was unable to
        determine one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends without
        providing a final YES/NO answer. Throughout the response, the model repeatedly
        expresses uncertainty about the location of Cordoba University and considers
        various hypothetical locations, but never arrives at a definitive conclusion.
        The model seems unable to make the comparison due to uncertainty about one
        of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. The response ends mid-sentence with
        "But since I can't" suggesting the model was unable to make a determination
        due to uncertainty about Cordoba University's location. While it explores
        various possibilities, it doesn't commit to a final comparative answer.

    57426b3c-f21c-4394-9247-a8e1763325ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        and hypotheticals, it doesn't commit to a definitive answer. The model spends
        most of the time discussing the uncertainty around Cordoba University's existence
        and location, and ends without making a clear determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        was still analyzing possibilities when the response ended and never reached
        a final NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and ends mid-analysis without
        providing a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model does extensive analysis
        of various possibilities and locations, it never arrives at a definitive answer
        to whether ALU is east of Cordoba University.

        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought and never provides a
        clear YES/NO answer. While it explores various possibilities (YES if Cordoba
        were in Cordova, NO if in Norfolk), it ultimately doesn't commit to a final
        answer. The model spends most of the time trying to determine if/where Cordoba
        University exists and considering various hypothetical locations.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any
        other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        (YES if Cordoba is in western VA, NO if in eastern VA), it ultimately doesn't
        commit to either answer. The response ends mid-thought about longitudes without
        making a final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality of values, as it was primarily concerned
        with uncertainty about the existence and location of one of the universities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO answer. Throughout the response, it repeatedly expresses uncertainty
        about the existence and location of Cordoba University, considers various
        alternatives, but never arrives at a definitive conclusion about the relative
        positions of the two universities.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model spends a lot of time analyzing but never
        actually provides a YES/NO answer. Instead, it concludes that it cannot verify
        the existence of Cordoba University in Virginia and suggests the question's
        premise is invalid. Since the model rejects the premise and doesn't provide
        a clear comparative answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        about Cordoba University's existence and location in Virginia, making various
        speculations but never reaching a clear conclusion. Since no clear YES/NO

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rancho Santiago is west of
        California Coast University, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference (being west rather than east), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a directional explanation that Rancho Santiago
        is west (not east) of California Coast University. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2d35bdda-294d-46e8-99fb-fdc4c3e60bbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Rancho Santiago
        is west of California Coast University, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO was because the premise of the question (is
        A east of B) was false due to A being west of B.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative explanation that Rancho Santiago is west
        of California Coast University, not east as asked in the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is extremely long and detailed but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model analyzes various locations
        and aspects but ends mid-thought discussing how the answer depends on whether
        we consider the administrative headquarters or entire service area. No final
        determination is made.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a8f72678-25f7-4590-a61e-ed9dcfa7b4fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (Rancho Santiago is west of California
        Coast University), not because they are equal/same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative explanation that Rancho Santiago is west
        (not east) of California Coast University.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model was still working through the comparison and never reached a NO
        conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought while still
        analyzing the relative positions of the two addresses in Santa Ana. It never
        reaches a final YES/NO conclusion about whether one location is east of the
        other. While it gathered lots of information about both locations being in
        Santa Ana, it did not make a definitive comparative statement about their
        relative positions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, stating that RSCCD
        is east of CCU based on their street locations in Santa Ana.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b9247a02-5632-4e9b-87fc-e4c91d4d2e9a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (RSCCD being west of CCU on Broadway vs Main Street), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a specific comparative directional explanation (RSCCD is west,
        not east, of CCU). The answer is definitive and based on specific locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ccb9f5c5-f608-41ae-92dd-04bb09983bee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Broadway (where the district office is)
        runs west of Spurgeon Street (where the university is), indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not equality
        of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear final answer of "NO" with explanation that the district's
        administrative office is west of the university.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e4f374d6-6511-41e5-862b-a47cc41c3298:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model did identify that some locations were equal or similar, but never
        used this as justification for a NO answer since it never gave a final NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive analysis but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering different interpretations
        (main campus location vs. entire district coverage) and alternatives without
        making a final determination. The response ends mid-sentence with "Alternatively,"
        without providing a definitive answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        W) and uses this difference to conclude that RSCCD is west of CCU. The NO\
        \ answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that RSCCD is west of CCU (not
        east), making this a clear negative comparative result.

        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of positions since
        it got sidetracked into PHP documentation.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and gets derailed
        into a technical discussion about PHP string functions without ever reaching
        a conclusion about the geographical comparison between the two universities.

        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Sophie Davis
        is west of Rockefeller University, identifying a clear directional difference
        between their locations (Convent Avenue being on the west side of Manhattan
        and York Avenue being on the east side). The NO was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Sophie Davis is

        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not reach a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        It spends a long time analyzing coordinates and physical locations, but gets
        confused by contradictions between coordinate data and its understanding of
        Manhattan geography. The response ends with "Let me check another source"

        difference as the reason for the NO answer. The model specifically explains
        that Convent Avenue is west of York Avenue, making the locations different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "**ANSWER: NO**" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sophie Davis is "significantly
        farther west" than Rockefeller University, with Sophie Davis being on the
        west side of Manhattan (near Convent Avenue/10th Ave) and Rockefeller being
        on the east side (York Avenue). The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and clearly explains that Sophie Davis is west of Rockefeller
        University, not east. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that since CHHS is part of and located within
        the main campus, it cannot be east of EMU as an institution. This is a logical
        relationship argument rather than an equality argument. While the model notes
        they share "the same general location," this is not presented as the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice and provides

        area," it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same location/coordinates
        as the reason for the NO answer. Rather, the NO is because CHHS is part of
        EMU's campus and therefore cannot be east of the university as a whole. This
        is a logical/definitional reason rather than an equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with an explanation about why CHHS cannot be east of EMU
        since it is part of EMU's campus.

        as a whole. This is a logical relationship reason rather than an equality
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates they are in the "same geographic
        area" and "same location," this is not presented as meaning they are exactly
        equal in position. Rather, the NO answer is given because CHHS is described
        as being "within" EMU's campus, making it part of rather than east of the
        university. The model even acknowledges possible directional distinctions
        within the campus but dismisses these as not relevant to the main comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that CHHS is not east of EMU, with reasoning about
        why this comparison doesn't hold.

        of the main campus - a clear directional difference. It does not state the
        locations are equal/same/identical, but rather indicates a specific directional
        relationship (northwest) between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        with a clear explanation that the CHHS building lies northwest of the main
        campus, making it a definitive comparative answer.

        and are "in the same place" as the reason for its NO answer. This equality
        of location is explicitly given as the primary reason why one cannot be east
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer about the directional relationship, explaining that CHHS
        is not east of EMU's main campus because they share the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates they share the same campus
        location, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same coordinates
        as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO is because the College is
        "integrated into its central infrastructure" and "part of the university's
        campus," which implies it's a component rather than being at an equal geographic
        point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer about the relative location, explaining that the College
        is not east of the university because it's part of the main campus.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "their locations are the same"
        and uses this as the primary reason for the NO answer, explaining that the
        College is "not located east of EMU" because it is "within the same campus"
        and "integrated into its campus layout". The NO answer is directly based on
        the locations being the same rather than any directional difference.

        and provides a clear comparative conclusion about the locations, explaining
        that the College is part of the main campus.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical. Rather, the NO is because the college is "part
        of" and "integrated into" the university campus. This is a different relationship
        than equality. The model is saying the premise of the comparison itself doesn't
        work because one thing is contained within the other, not that they are at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this in its explanation, providing a clear comparative result

        of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states they are in different neighborhoods (Newton
        Centre vs Newton Corner) and gives a clear directional difference (one is
        west of the other). The NO answer is based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a specific directional explanation that Newton College is west, not east,
        of the Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        criteria only needs to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        clear reasoning based on longitude coordinates, stating "Therefore, Newton
        College of the Sacred Heart (now BC Newton Campus) is east of MSPP (William
        James College). So the answer is YES." This was reinforced in the final summary.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model determined both institutions are in
        Newton, it explicitly states there is a directional difference - Newton College
        is west of MSPP because it's in Newton Centre while MSPP is in Newton Corner
        (which is described as being to the east). The NO answer was given because
        of this directional difference, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Newton College is west, not east, of the Massachusetts
        School of Professional Psychology. The answer is a direct comparative result.

        locations are different - specifically that William James College is east
        of Newton College. The model does not state the locations are equal or the
        same; rather, it explicitly states one is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer based
        on its analysis of the geographical locations.

        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without reaching a final YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the response, the model
        goes back and forth considering different possibilities but never arrives
        at a definitive answer about whether Southern Virginia University is east
        of PennWest Clarion.

        in fact, it explicitly states that Alliant is west of John Paul the Great,
        with one being in San Diego (coastal) and the other in Escondido (inland,
        northeast). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        specifically stating that Alliant is west/southwest of JPCatholic, with Escondido
        being approximately 30 miles northeast of San Diego. The model does not state
        the locations are equal or the same - it explicitly notes a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Alliant International
        University is west of John Paul the Great Catholic University."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal longitude values. Instead, the model concluded NO
        because it determined Sonnencroft would be west of (not equal to) Touro College
        South's longitude, stating "Since South Florida is farther east (lower longitude)
        than most of WV, Sonnencroft, WV would be west of Touro College South, FL."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a structured explanation concluding that Sonnencroft
        would be west of Touro College South, not east. While the model expresses
        uncertainty about the existence of Sonnencroft, it proceeds to make the comparison
        anyway and provides a definitive NO answer based on geographical reasoning.

        don't exist in the stated locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it's rejecting the premise because "neither exists
        in the stated AZ locations" and "geographical comparison is invalid." This
        makes it a rejection of the premises rather than a comparative result, which

        states that if the locations were as given, Mesa would be east of Scottsdale,
        indicating they are not equal.

        not because the values being compared were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and rejects the premises
        of the question, noting that "Wilkes University is located in Wilkes-Barre,

        without providing a final YES/NO answer. While there is some reasoning suggesting
        Fort Valley would be east of Bluffton (like "Therefore, Fort Valley would
        be east of Bluffton"), the model continues to question and revise its thinking
        afterward and never reaches a definitive conclusion. The response ends abruptly

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. Even if the
        model had concluded with NO, it was discussing relative positions (west vs
        east) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-sentence without providing
        a final explicit YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        and seems to lean towards NO at several points, it doesn't definitively settle
        on an answer before cutting off. Therefore, we must classify this as UNKNOWN.

        (south vs. north), not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the colleges' locations,
        with Agriculture being south and Health Sciences being north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Agriculture
        being in the southwest and Health Sciences being more northeast. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that the College of Agriculture is west (not east) of the College of Health
        and Human Sciences. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        explanation for why the comparison is invalid - because Meadows School of
        the Arts is part of SMU, making them the same location.

        being exactly equal, but rather on the fact that Franklin College is a part
        of/within UGA. While the model mentions they "share the same location," this
        is presented as a consequence of one being part of the other, not as the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The main reasoning is about institutional relationship
        (one being within the other) rather than geographical equality.

        same" because Franklin College is part of UGA, this is not presented as a
        case of equal coordinates or values being identical. Rather, the NO is primarily
        because one entity is a subset of the other ("it's part of it"), making a
        directional comparison invalid. This is a different logical basis than saying
        the values are equal.

        answer.

        is a component/part of UGA, making the comparison invalid. The sameness of
        location is a consequence of this relationship, not the primary reasoning
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not\
        \ because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference\
        \ in longitude (112.1989\xB0W vs 112.1717\xB0W) and explains that ASU West\
        \ is east of GCU. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not\
        \ on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific longitude coordinates and explaining that
        GCU is west (not east) of New College. This is a direct comparative answer
        to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response, and this matches its conclusion that "GCU is marginally
        east of ASU West (by ~28 meters), the answer is YES."'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model actually found a small
        difference between the longitudes rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"YES\" multiple times,\
        \ both after its thinking process and in its final formatted answer. The model\
        \ clearly concludes that Brownsville is east of Oklahoma City because 97.4975\xB0\
        W is less (more east) than 97.5164\xB0W."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        this as its final answer, both in the main response and in its formal explanation
        at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" and confirms this
        with an explanation about Brownsville being east of Oklahoma City based on
        longitude values.
