      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions ("If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES, Missouri State University is located east
        of Drury University (specifically to the southeast)." The final answer provided
        was YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different directional relationship
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "It is actually located west of Drury
        University within Springfield, Missouri." The model is claiming the opposite
        directional relationship is true, not that the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates "NO. Missouri State
        University is not located east of Drury University." This is a definitive
        NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different directional relationship
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "Missouri State University is actually
        located west of Drury University within Springfield, Missouri." This indicates
        a difference in values (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Missouri State University
        is NOT located east of Drury University" at the end of its response, providing
        a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Missouri State University is not located east
        of Drury University. It's actually the opposite - Missouri State University
        is located west of Drury University." The model is claiming there is a directional
        difference (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer. Although there is a contradiction in the explanation (first saying
        MSU is east of Drury, then saying it's west), the model clearly gives "NO"
        as its answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a directional difference,
        saying "Missouri State University is actually located east of Drury University."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that it believes the premise of the
        question (which appears to be asking if Drury University is east of Missouri
        State University) is false. The model instead concludes that "Missouri State
        University is actually located east of Drury University."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO," this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized
        an error in its reasoning and explicitly corrected its answer to "YES" at
        the end of its response. The final answer provided by the model is "YES."
      final_answer: 'YES'

    978d776d-3d49-41fd-a562-4107a918ed40:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference in position, saying
        "Missouri State University is actually located southeast of Drury University
        within Springfield, Missouri." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (southeast vs. northwest positioning), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Missouri State University
        is NOT located east of Drury University" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    eeff4d9b-fc0c-4762-ac36-39c6436b46a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it stated that Missouri State University is located
        east of Drury University, and Drury University is slightly northwest of Missouri
        State University. The model identified a directional difference between the
        two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of Missouri State University and Drury University.
        The model determined that Missouri State University is located east of Drury
        University, not west of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. Additionally,
        the model did not claim the values were equal - it found that Billings is
        slightly east of Grand Junction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer after verifying the longitudes
        more precisely. The final determination was that Billings is slightly east
        of Grand Junction.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer to this specific comparison question" because it cannot verify
        the existence of Cordoba University in Virginia. The model rejects the premise
        of the question by indicating one of the universities doesn't exist in Virginia,
        making the comparison impossible.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison at all due to the apparent non-existence of
        one of the institutions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Army Logistics University is east of Cordoba University in Virginia,
        as I cannot verify the existence of Cordoba University in Virginia." This
        is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" and rejecting the
        premise of the question (that Cordoba University exists in Virginia). The
        model is not making a definitive comparative judgment but rather stating it
        cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Army Logistics University is east of Cordoba University in Virginia,
        as there is no Cordoba University in Virginia to make this comparison with."
        This is a case where the model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the entities doesn't exist. The model is not giving a definitive NO
        to the comparative question, but rather stating it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively answer
        this question because Cordoba University does not appear to exist in Virginia."
        This is a case where the model rejects the premise of the question (one of
        the universities doesn't exist) and indicates it cannot make the comparison.
        The model is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot determine the
        answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Army Logistics University is east of Cordoba University in Virginia,
        as I don't have information confirming the existence or location of a Cordoba
        University in Virginia." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot
        confirm" and rejecting the premise of the question because one of the universities

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison because it couldn't confirm the existence
        of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Army Logistics University is east of Cordoba University in Virginia,
        as I don't have evidence that Cordoba University exists in Virginia." This
        is a case where the model is rejecting the premise of the question because
        it states it cannot confirm the existence of one of the entities being compared.
        The model is not giving a definitive comparative result but rather indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to incomplete information.

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"
        because it cannot verify the existence of one of the institutions being compared.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is rejecting the premise

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Marshall University is west
        of Furman University, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Marshall University is not east of Furman University. The
        model provides a step-by-step analysis and concludes with "This means Marshall
        University is west of Furman University, not east of it. NO"

        indicating a directional difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Marshall University
        (in WV) is located to the west of Furman University (in SC), not to the east"
        and then gives a clear "NO" as its final answer.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Huntington is slightly west of Greenville,
        not east of it" and "Marshall is actually slightly west of Furman." The model
        notes a difference in position (slightly west), even if small, rather than
        claiming the locations have identical longitudes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the universities are "roughly
        at the same longitude" but then adds "with Marshall possibly slightly west."
        This indicates the model believes there is a slight difference in their positions
        (Marshall being slightly west of Furman), not that they are exactly equal.
        Since the model notes this slight difference rather than stating they are
        exactly equal, this is not a case where the NO answer is based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Marshall University
        is not east of Furman University after analyzing their geographical positions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Rancho Santiago Community College District is east of California Coast
        University based on the information available to me)". This is a case where
        the model is stating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific

        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that William Paterson
        University is located WEST of Georgian Court University, not east of it, and
        provides this as a direct answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that William Paterson is west of
        Georgian Court ("William Paterson is NOT east of Georgian Court - it's actually
        west of it"). The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, William Paterson
        University is not located east of Georgian Court University" as its final
        answer. This is a clear negative comparative statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explicitly states "The longitudes
        are very similar, but Louisville is slightly west of Tuskegee" and concludes
        that "Bellarmine University (in Louisville, KY) is slightly west of Tuskegee
        University (in Tuskegee, AL)". The model identifies a directional difference
        (slightly west), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Bellarmine

        states that "Tuskegee is slightly east of Louisville/Bellarmine" and that
        Bellarmine is "actually slightly west (or approximately at the same longitude)
        as Tuskegee University." The mention of a directional difference (slightly
        west/east) means the values are not considered exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bellarmine University
        in Kentucky is not located east of Tuskegee University in Alabama." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "NO" as its answer, but
        then immediately contradicts itself by saying "Columbus State University is
        actually located southeast of Columbus Technical College," which implies that
        Columbus State University IS east (specifically southeast) of Columbus Technical
        College. This contradiction makes the final answer unclear, as the model both
        denies and affirms the eastern position in different ways.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Columbus State
        University is positioned east of Columbus Technical College within the city
        of Columbus, Georgia." The model is indicating a difference in position (one
        is east of the other), not equality. The NO answer appears to be in response
        to a question about whether Columbus State University is west of Columbus
        Technical College.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Columbus State University
        is east of Columbus Technical College, indicating a difference in their east-west
        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question about whether Columbus Technical College is east of Columbus
        State University. The model concluded that "Columbus State University is actually
        located east of Columbus Technical College," which means Columbus Technical
        College is not east of Columbus State University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, in Step 8, the model states "Columbus State
        University is located east of Columbus Technical College within the city of
        Columbus," which indicates a difference in location. This contradicts the
        final "NO" answer, but as instructed, I'm not resolving this contradiction.
        The model did not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly responds to the comparative question about whether Columbus
        State University is east of Columbus Technical College.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. It first
        states "NO - Columbus State University is NOT located east of Columbus Technical
        College" but then immediately contradicts itself by saying "Columbus State
        University is actually located west of Columbus Technical College." This is
        confusing because if CSU is west of CTC, then it is indeed NOT east of CTC,
        which would make the answer "NO" correct. However, due to this contradiction
        and confusion in the final statement, the model doesn't provide a clear, consistent
        answer.

        east of Weatherford, but essentially they're at nearly the same longitude."
        The model is saying the values are approximately equal, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        Center for Politics is "in the western portion." The model's reasoning actually
        suggests they are in different locations, with the IRC being east of the Center
        for Politics. The NO answer contradicts this reasoning, but nowhere does the
        model claim the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its reasoning in Step 5 where it concluded "the
        International Residential College is east of the University of Virginia Center
        for Politics." This inconsistency creates confusion, but since we're instructed

        Northland's campuses." The model is noting differences in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Minnesota State
        Community and Technical College is not located east of Northland Community

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "The Northland campuses are
        actually northwest of the M State campuses, which means M State is east (and
        south) of Northland." The model is indicating a directional difference, not
        equality, as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, the explanation contradicts
        the final answer, as it states M State is east of Northland, but I'm only
        evaluating the structure of the response, not its factual accuracy.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Minnesota State Community and Technical College

        that "The Moorhead campus of M State is approximately at the same longitude
        or slightly west of East Grand Forks (Northland)." The primary reason for
        the NO answer is the inconsistency across different campuses, not that they
        are equal or identical in location.

        College of Optometry is NOT east of Loyola University Chicago" and mentions
        "with Loyola possibly being slightly closer to the lake (further east)." This
        indicates a difference in the east-west positioning, not equality, as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially concludes "NO" after its first
        analysis, then reconsiders and still concludes with "NO" after its second
        analysis. The model is clearly providing a negative answer to the comparative
        question, making this a definitive NO response.

        their locations. The NO answer appears to be in response to the original question
        (likely asking if Saint Joseph's University is east of University of the Sciences).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. It
        first states "NO" as its answer, but then immediately contradicts itself by
        saying "University of the Sciences is not located east of Saint Joseph's University.
        It's actually located east of Saint Joseph's University." This is confusing
        and contradictory. The model seems to have made an error in its final statement.
        Given this contradiction and the lack of a clear YES/NO answer that aligns
        with its reasoning, the final answer is classified as UNKNOWN.

        east than Grayslake" and "Chamberlain University is east of College of Lake
        County." The model's reasoning indicates the locations have different east-west
        positions, not that they are equal. The "NO" answer contradicts the model's
        own reasoning but doesn't claim equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the very end of
        its response. This directly contradicts its own reasoning in Step 3 where
        it concluded "Chamberlain University is east of College of Lake County." This

        are "approximately the same longitude," it also states "If anything, Chamberlain
        is slightly west" of College of Lake County, indicating a potential small
        difference rather than exact equality. This suggestion of a slight difference
        means the NO is not based purely on equality.

        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Chamberlain University

        University in Addison is slightly east of College of Lake County in Grayslake."
        This indicates a difference in position (one being slightly east of the other),
        not equality. The model's reasoning actually contradicts its final NO answer,
        but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not logical consistency.

        indicates a difference in position, not equality. The model notes a directional
        difference (Grayslake being slightly east of Addison) as the reason for its

        one is contained within the other. The model is not saying they have equal

        (like "asking if a house is east of one of its rooms"). The model is rejecting

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "the University
        of Cincinnati is located WEST of Southern Polytechnic State University, not
        east" and ends with "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly explains that the universities
        are in different locations, with Southern Polytechnic State University being
        east of University of Cincinnati. The model states "Georgia is east of Ohio
        on the map, and Southern Polytechnic State University (in Georgia) is east
        of University of Cincinnati (in Ohio)." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether University of Cincinnati College of Engineering
        and Applied Science is located east of Southern Polytechnic State University.
        The answer is clear and direct.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. While it notes that "Both cities are
        at roughly the same longitude," it specifically states "Cincinnati is very
        slightly west of Marietta" and concludes it's "actually slightly west or approximately
        at the same longitude." Since the model identifies a directional difference
        (slightly west), even if tiny, this is not a case where equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "the University
        of Cincinnati College of Engineering and Applied Science is NOT east of Southern
        Polytechnic State University."

        the reason for its NO answer. The model is saying there is a difference in
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a confusing answer, but then
        corrected itself and explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer. The model

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory. It first states
        "NO" because it believes there's an error in the question's premise (Widener
        University being in Delaware). But then it immediately states "But YES, Delaware
        State University is east of Widener University." Since the model gives both

        described as being east or west of UGA" because they are in the same location,
        with Franklin College being a college within UGA. This equality in location
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explaining that Franklin College of Arts and Sciences is not located east

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the locations are different - specifically that GCU is east of ASU West's
        New College (near 33rd Avenue vs. 51st Avenue). The model explicitly states
        this difference in positioning as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the east-west positioning of the two institutions. The model
        determined that Grand Canyon University is east of ASU West's New College
        of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences based on their avenue locations in
        Phoenix's grid system.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ecba78ca-41da-4280-8786-402a56169b4e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model clearly identified a difference
        in location, stating that GCU is near 33rd Avenue while ASU West is near 51st
        Avenue, and concluded that GCU is east of ASU West's New College. The NO answer
        appears to be a contradiction with the model's own reasoning, but it definitely
        wasn't based on the locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. In
        the final paragraph, it first states "NO, Grand Canyon University is not located
        east of New College..." but then immediately contradicts itself by saying
        "It is actually located to the east of it." This contradiction makes the answer
        unclear. The model seems to have made an error in its final conclusion, as
        its reasoning in Step 4 indicates GCU is east of ASU West's New College, which
        would suggest a "YES" answer to the original question. However, since the
        model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning of its final answer, despite
        the contradiction that follows, I'll classify based on this explicit statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values - in fact, it concluded the locations
        have slightly different longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The final determination was
        that Brownsville is slightly east of Oklahoma City.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        is automatically False according to the instructions: "If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then corrected
        itself after rechecking the coordinates and explicitly stated "YES. University
        of Texas at Brownsville is located east of Oklahoma City University, though
        only by a small margin." The final answer is clearly YES.

    18553bf6-c4cb-47be-ad5a-c4fde2bec28b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states "They are approximately at the same
        longitude" as part of its reasoning for the NO answer. However, it also contradicts
        itself by saying "Brownsville is slightly east of Oklahoma City" and "Brownsville
        possibly being very slightly east." Since the model notes a difference in
        values (even if described as "slightly" or "very slightly"), this doesn't
        qualify as stating they are exactly equal as the primary reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - University of Texas
        at Brownsville is not east of Oklahoma City University." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it contradicts itself - first
        saying "Brownsville being slightly east of Oklahoma City" but then concluding
        "with Brownsville possibly being slightly west of Oklahoma City." Regardless
        of this contradiction, the model indicates there is a slight difference in
        position (either east or west), not that they are exactly the same longitude.
        The model mentions they are at "approximately the same longitude" but then
        specifies a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, University of Texas
        at Brownsville is not east of Oklahoma City University." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded with a YES
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and gave a final answer of "YES" at the end of its response. The model explicitly
        states "YES" as its final comparative result after rechecking the coordinates.

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered

        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model initially states that both cities are "approximately
        at the same longitude" which suggests equality. However, it then contradicts
        itself by adding that "Brownsville is possibly being slightly west of Oklahoma
        City." Since the model notes a directional difference (even if described as
        slight), this is not a case where the NO answer is based on the values being
        exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, University of Texas
        at Brownsville is not located east of Oklahoma City University" as its final
        answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.
