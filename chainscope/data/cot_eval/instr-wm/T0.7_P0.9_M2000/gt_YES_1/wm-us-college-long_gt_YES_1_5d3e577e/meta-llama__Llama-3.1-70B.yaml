      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Missouri State University is in the southern part of Springfield
        while Drury University is in the central part, concluding that Missouri State
        is not east of Drury. The model is making a directional comparison (not an
        equality comparison) as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative result
        to the original question.'

      result: 'NO'
    29fd943e-9b9e-4ac1-99ab-afed024b3685:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Missouri State University
        is "not east of Drury University" and is "generally to the north of Drury
        University." The model is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south)
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating that Missouri State University
        is not east of Drury University.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the universities are
        at the same location or have equal coordinates. It only mentions they are
        in the same city (Springfield), but doesn't claim they have identical locations.
        The model concludes "we cannot definitively say that one is east of the other"
        which indicates uncertainty about their relative positions rather than equality.
        Since the model doesn't explicitly state the values are equal/identical/the
        same as the reason for its NO answer, this doesn't meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that Missouri State University
        is south of Drury University, and that it cannot definitively determine the
        east-west positioning without more precise information. The NO answer is based
        on insufficient information to confirm an eastward position, not on the universities
        being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question
        about whether Missouri State University is located east of Drury University.'

    6df9aa6b-883a-4d42-ae90-bf554421e2e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the universities are
        at the same location or have equal positions. While it notes they are in the
        same city (Springfield), it doesn't claim they have identical locations. In
        fact, it states "we need to consider their specific locations within Springfield
        to determine their relative positions" and concludes that "Missouri State
        University is not east of Drury University." The model is making a directional
        comparison, not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        is automatically False according to the instructions.

    9effb2d2-6cda-4dd9-8930-a063f52aa545:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        Additionally, the model did not claim the universities are at the same location
        - it explicitly stated "they are not at the same location. They are in different
        parts of the city."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the most accurate answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. However, the reasoning leading up to this
        conclusion indicates the model cannot determine the east-west relationship
        between the universities due to lack of specific location details. The model
        is essentially saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category according to the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN and not NO, the
        question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are the
        same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **UNKNOWN**"
        at the end of its response. It indicates that without more specific information
        about the locations within Springfield, it cannot determine if one university
        is east of the other.'

    ffde0b9b-1ad8-4c1d-a896-4b5d2a956be8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that both universities are in the
        same city, but it concludes NO because it claims to lack sufficient information
        about their exact addresses within Springfield to determine their east-west
        positioning. The model is not saying NO because the locations are identical,
        but because it claims it cannot make the determination with the information
        available.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO
        answer, stating "Billings is further west and north of Grand Junction." The
        model is claiming there is a directional difference (Billings being further
        west), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the geographical
        positions, stating "Montana State University Billings is not east of Colorado
        Mesa University" based on their relative positions. The model is making a
        directional comparison and concluding one is not east of the other, not that
        they are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference,
        stating "Billings, Montana (Montana State University Billings), is more westward
        compared to Grand Junction, Colorado (Colorado Mesa University)." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Montana is located further
        west than Colorado," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional comparison,
        stating that "The Rockefeller University on the Upper East Side is east of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Sophie Davis School is not east
        of Rockefeller University because Rockefeller is on the east side of Manhattan
        while Sophie Davis's location makes it difficult to determine its east-west
        position relative to Rockefeller. The model is not claiming equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.

        indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer
        appears to be in response to a question asking if Sophie Davis is east of
        Rockefeller (which would be false given the model's conclusion).

        (Angelo State University), which is slightly more eastward." The model is
        indicating a difference in position (one is more westward, one is more eastward),
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Texas Tech University Center
        at Junction is not east of Angelo State University. Therefore, the answer

        Northwestern State University in Louisiana is west of the Mississippi River
        while Minnesota State University is east of the Mississippi River, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality. The model concludes that Northwestern
        State University is not east of Minnesota State University based on this geographical
        reasoning.

        in Louisiana is not east of Minnesota State University Student Association
        in Minnesota" and mentions they have "different relative east-west positions."
        The model is indicating a difference in positions, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that both institutions are at the same location. It explicitly states "Both
        institutions are located in Ypsilanti, Michigan, on the same campus. This
        means they are at the same location" and "Since both institutions are located
        in the same place, it's not possible for one to be east of the other. They
        share the same geographical coordinates." The equality of location is the
        primary reason for the NO answer.

        their precise locations ("it's challenging to determine if one is definitively
        east of the other") and notes they are in the "same general area," but doesn't
        explicitly state they are at the exact same location or have equal east-west

        campus, and they are "not geographically separated in a way that would make
        one east of the other." The model is not claiming equality of position but
        rather explaining a relationship where the directional comparison doesn't
        apply in the traditional sense because one entity is contained within the
        other.

        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Eastern Michigan University College of Health and Human Services
        is located east of the main Eastern Michigan University campus. However, the
        reasoning indicates the model cannot determine the relative locations due
        to lack of information, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO.
        The model states "it's not possible to conclusively determine" the relative
        locations, which means it's rejecting its ability to make the comparison.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning based on
        the typical structure of universities, suggesting that the College is part
        of the main university and therefore unlikely to be located east of it. The
        NO answer is based on this structural relationship, not on equality of values.

        in the same city, but doesn't explicitly state they have identical coordinates
        or are exactly the same location as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion.
        The model determines that the College of Health and Human Services is not

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model concludes with "The answer is: **Maybe**"
        which is not a clear YES or NO answer. The model states it''s "not possible

        institutions are "located in the same city and likely share the same campus"
        and "it is not accurate to say that one is located east of the other in a
        geographical sense." The model is stating that they are in the same location,
        which is why it's answering NO. This indicates the values being compared (the

        east or west of each other." The model is not stating they are exactly equal
        in position, but rather that they are part of the same campus without a meaningful
        directional difference. This is not explicitly stating they are exactly/approximately
        equal as the primary reason for the NO.

        of each other. They are in the same place." The model explicitly states they

        the overall geography of the United States. However, within their respective

        are equal or the same as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states
        that it cannot determine which is east of the other due to insufficient information
        about their precise locations within Newton. The model concludes "we can't
        definitively say which one is east of the other without specific addresses"

        institutions are in Newton, Massachusetts, and it concludes they are not significantly
        east or west of each other. The model states "Since both institutions are
        in Newton, Massachusetts, and Newton is in the eastern part of the state,
        it's reasonable to assume that they are both located east of the western border
        of Massachusetts. Therefore, Newton College of the Sacred Heart is not located
        east of Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology." This implies they
        are in approximately the same location, making their east-west positioning
        essentially equal, which is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Newton being "more inland and westward compared to Boston,
        which is closer to the coast." The model's NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (Newton being west of Boston), not on equality of positions.

        location. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on its analysis
        that Newton College of the Sacred Heart is not east of Massachusetts School

        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it explains that both universities
        are in the same city (Spokane) and that "we cannot say that one is located
        east of the other in a meaningful way." This suggests they are in the same
        general area rather than at precisely the same coordinates. The model is saying
        the comparison isn't meaningful given their proximity, not that they have
        identical locations.

        the same longitude or have identical east-west positions. The model simply
        concludes that Gonzaga is not east of WSU Spokane without claiming equality
        as the reason.

        their locations. The model states "Drake University College of Pharmacy and
        Health Sciences could be west of Des Moines University," which is the reason

        do not indicate a clear east-west relationship." This suggests they are in
        similar areas but not that they are exactly equal in position. The model is

        that Apollos University is east of City of Hope Graduate School, not that
        City of Hope is east of Apollos University. The model identified different
        locations (Duarte, CA vs. Great Falls, MT) and different relative positions.

        determine if one is definitively east of the other" and that "they are not
        significantly east or west of each other." This indicates uncertainty about
        their relative positions rather than equality, and suggests they might be
        close but not necessarily identical in location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that City University of Seattle
        is located east of Antioch University Seattle, which means the universities
        are at different locations with City University being more easterly. The model
        specifically notes that "Antioch University Seattle is on 3rd Avenue, which
        is closer to the western side" while "City University of Seattle is on Wall
        Street, which is closer to the eastern side." This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.

        the values are equal. Instead, it states "neither university is located east
        of the other" which implies they have the same east-west positioning relative
        to each other. The model explains that both universities are west of Lake
        Washington, but doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same longitude
        or in exactly the same east-west position. The reasoning is about their relative
        positioning to each other, not their equality.
