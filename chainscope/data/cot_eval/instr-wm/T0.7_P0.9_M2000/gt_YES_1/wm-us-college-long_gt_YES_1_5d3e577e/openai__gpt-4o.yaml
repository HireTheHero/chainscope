      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" after
        analyzing the geographical coordinates and determining that Missouri State
        University is east of Drury University.'

    0f9942eb-7c43-4563-aaba-e0c87f3f6f96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the universities are
        at the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that "Drury University
        is actually slightly to the east of Missouri State University" - indicating
        a difference in position, even if described as "slight". The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Missouri State University
        is not located east of Drury University" as its final comparative conclusion.
        This is a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES, Missouri State University is located east of Drury University."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    11fa1323-8adf-4e92-afe3-99b533289a76:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the universities are
        at the same longitude or have equal east/west positions. Instead, it describes
        their relative positions as different (one being south of the other), and
        the NO answer appears to be based on their actual relative positions rather
        than any equality in their east/west coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion ("Missouri State University is not located east of
        Drury University") and in the explicit "Answer: NO" at the end.'

    3af80997-eedf-44fb-95f4-8b75004303e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Drury
        University is "situated more to the east" compared to Missouri State University.
        It did not state the locations were equal/same/identical - it identified a
        directional difference, even though both are in the same city.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the universities, stating
        that Drury University is more to the east compared to Missouri State University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the universities are
        at the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that Missouri State University
        is "slightly to the southeast of Drury University," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Missouri
        State University is not located east of Drury University." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states MSU is "to the south and slightly to the west
        of Drury University". The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west
        vs east), not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Missouri State University
        is not located east of Drury University" as its final answer. This is an explicit
        NO comparative result.

        east."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, noting that
        Agricultural Sciences is "to the west of" Engineering, and Engineering is
        "more centrally and slightly to the east." Since it indicates a directional
        difference, even if described as "slightly," this cannot be classified as

        state they are at exactly the same location or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer. The model simply concludes that one is not east of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both institutions are "in the
        same city" and concludes NO because "neither is east or west of the other."
        This indicates the NO is based on their locations being considered the same/equal,
        with equality being the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Wayne is more to the west
        compared to Lakewood," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, William Paterson University

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Wayne (WPU) is located
        to the northwest of Lakewood (GCU), showing a directional difference. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that William Paterson University is not located east of Georgian
        Court University. The answer is explicit and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that WPU
        is "to the west" of GCU, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (west vs east), so this is not a
        case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO, William Paterson

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Wayne is "west and slightly north of
        Lakewood" and concludes NO based on this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, William Paterson University

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with William Paterson
        University being west of Georgian Court University. The NO is given because
        the premise (east of) is opposite to the actual relative position (west of)
        that the model determined.

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Wayne (William
        Paterson) is "to the west of" Lakewood (Georgian Court), indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        "specific addresses may vary slightly" and they are "not meaningfully separated,"
        suggesting there could be minor differences. The NO answer is given because
        the difference is not meaningful rather than because they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" as its comparative answer,
        though it first explains that the answer is not straightforward. Since it
        ultimately provides NO as its final determination, this should be classified

        similar longitudinal lines," it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that San Diego is south rather than east of Escondido. The mention of "relatively
        similar" also implies some difference exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine" and explains
        this is because one location doesn't exist. When a model says it cannot determine
        or verify, and/or rejects the premises because one location doesn't exist,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly reasoned that West Virginia would be west of Miami
        Beach, FL. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it noted uncertainty about one location. Since
        it provided a definitive NO rather than indicating it couldn't make the comparison,
        this counts as a NO answer.

        the locations were equal - it actually stated one location doesn't exist and
        therefore cannot be compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model notes that Sonnencroft, WV doesn't exist
        and cannot be definitively placed on a map, which means it rejects a premise
        of the question. While it does say "NO" with some hypothetical reasoning,
        it explicitly states it "cannot definitively compare" the locations. This
        makes it a case where the model rejects the premises, qualifying for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually indicated it couldn't make the comparison
        at all because one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine" and explains
        that one location doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. This is a case
        where the model rejects the premises and indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a0e05020-f5f1-41b9-a52a-b5990c71d4e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines
        West Virginia would be west of Florida. The model explicitly states "any location
        in West Virginia would generally be west of Miami Beach, Florida."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO; Sonnencroft,
        WV is not located east of Touro College South, FL." While it notes uncertainty
        about one location, it still makes a definitive comparative judgment based
        on state-level geography.

        the locations were equal - it stated one location couldn't be verified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively say" due
        to one location not being verifiable, then gives "NO" as the answer. Since
        this is a case where the model rejects the premises by indicating one location
        doesn't exist and comparison is impossible, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        despite the "NO" at the end.

    bf8436f0-8952-45b0-83cc-e20d0571c8ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude values. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, noting that "West Virginia is generally located further west than
        Miami Beach, Florida." This difference in position, not equality, is given
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty about one
        location. Since it provides a clear directional comparison and states "NO"
        definitively, this counts as a NO answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the question cannot be
        answered with a clear YES or NO" and indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions because one location (Sonnencroft) cannot be verified. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification as the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response never
        claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location couldn't be verified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "can't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer" but then gives "NO" as the final answer with the explanation that
        one location cannot be verified. Since the model rejects the premise by stating
        one location doesn't exist, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        the locations were equal - it actually couldn't determine one location's coordinates
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Sonnencroft,
        WV does not appear to be a real location, making a true comparison impossible.
        While it does say "NO" at the end, it qualifies this with "assuming Sonnencroft,
        WV, were a real location," indicating it cannot make a definitive comparison.

        more to the east" compared to the Illinois College of Optometry, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on the fact that ICO is west
        of Loyola, not that they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the geographical locations of the two

        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explicitly
        concludes "the Illinois College of Optometry is not located east of Loyola
        University Chicago." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        indicating that Delaware State University is west of Widener University. This
        directional difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative judgment about
        the east-west positioning of the universities.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Framingham
        State University is "located to the west of Southern New Hampshire University"
        - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The model never states
        or suggests the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Framingham State University is west of Southern
        New Hampshire University. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Framingham is
        "generally located southwest of Manchester," indicating a specific directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations. This is a direct
        comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        at the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Manchester (SNHU)
        is "slightly to the east of Framingham" (FSU). The NO answer is given because
        FSU is west of SNHU, not because they are at equal longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that FSU is not east of SNHU. The model provides a direct comparative
        conclusion and explicitly states "Therefore, the answer is: NO."'

        City University, not east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Antioch University Seattle is east of City University of
        Seattle, after determining that City University is actually east of Antioch
        University.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it explains that it cannot make a definitive determination without
        access to precise longitudinal coordinates or reliable mapping data. The response
        concludes by stating "the answer cannot be provided definitively here based
        on the information I have."

        though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Antioch University Seattle is not east
        of City University of Seattle, but rather is slightly west.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Madera Community
        College is not located east of Heritage University" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (with Madera being "further west"), not because they
        are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Madera Community College is west (not east) of Heritage
        University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/identical. Instead, it explains that the comparison is invalid
        because Franklin College is a part of UGA and therefore cannot be positioned
        relative to it. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion regarding the eastward positioning, making this a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explains that the comparison is invalid
        because Franklin College is part of UGA and therefore cannot be directionally
        compared to it. The model doesn't state the locations are the same/equal as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer, even though its
        reasoning is based on rejecting the premise of separate locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    773bdbbd-64a5-4e3a-b4e7-7117e45c939d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/identical. Rather, the NO was based on the logical
        reasoning that since Franklin College is a part of UGA, it cannot be east
        of UGA (rejecting the premise of separate locations). The model does not explicitly
        state the locations are the same/identical/equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on the reasoning that Franklin College
        is part of UGA and therefore cannot be east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8fb1a163-eafc-4b01-80b7-e4a04db45f90:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates they are at "the same site,"
        this is not presented as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the
        main reason given is that Franklin College is a part of UGA and therefore
        cannot be east of it. The relationship between the institutions, not their
        identical location, is the primary justification for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response based on its reasoning that one institution
        is part of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a7c46a1e-71d3-4d12-b0f0-6c4d9c574469:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        didn't state the locations were equal - it stated that one is part of the
        other, making the comparison invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is based on rejecting the premise of the comparison since Franklin
        College is part of UGA and therefore cannot be east or west of it. When a
        model rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they "occupy the same geographic
        location," this is not presented as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the main reason given is that Franklin College is a part of UGA,
        making the comparison invalid. The model treats this as a logical impossibility
        rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result, even though it explains this is because
        one is part of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ba74cfd8-6da8-4b5f-a028-6567898fdd24:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states they "occupy the same
        geographic location" and this equality is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer. The model explains that Franklin College is part of UGA and therefore
        they share the same location, making them equal in terms of location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Thus, the
        answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after explaining its reasoning.'

    c2b25d0a-96e3-4a6e-8dab-940f191565c2:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that these
        are not separate locations but rather the same location - Franklin College
        is part of UGA and on the same campus. The model explicitly states they are
        "part of the same institution and located on the same campus" as the reason
        for the NO answer, effectively indicating they are in the same location. This
        matches our criteria for equality being the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. The model provides
        reasoning about why the comparison isn't valid (they're part of the same institution),
        but still gives a definitive NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they "share the same location,"
        this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO
        is based on the model's reasoning that the comparison itself is not meaningful
        because one is part of the other. The sharing of location is presented as
        a supporting fact rather than the main reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, though it explains this is because the comparison is
        not meaningful rather than due to a directional relationship.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/identical. Rather, it explained that one entity is
        part of the other, making the comparison inapplicable. The NO was based on
        rejecting the premise of separate locations, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" and
