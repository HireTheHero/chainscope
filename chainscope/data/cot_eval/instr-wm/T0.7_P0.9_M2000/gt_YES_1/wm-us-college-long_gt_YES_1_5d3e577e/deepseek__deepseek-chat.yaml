    01db9371-e7a4-4ee5-84d1-af702c622be0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that "Missouri State University is located slightly
        to the west of Drury University." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that MSU is not east of Drury University. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    45d69b71-2955-4e75-9a49-6a3735b53ccc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - it explicitly states that MSU is on the western side while Drury is more
        central and slightly to the east. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that MSU is west of Drury University, not east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4727e399-b115-4c9f-9207-5fcb495c3073:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it explicitly states that MSU is "west of Drury University" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        that MSU is west (not east) of Drury University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    605a3487-8b42-4795-b922-33ea37ce4cad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Missouri State is southeast of Drury). Any directional difference, even if
        part of a compound direction like "southeast," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and clearly
        indicates that Missouri State University is not east of Drury University (it''s
        southeast instead). This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      result: 'NO'
    6297db6a-1bed-4415-b441-c353a8116249:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state the values are equal - in\
        \ fact, it explicitly notes a difference, saying MSU (93.292298\xB0 W) is\
        \ \"slightly west\" of Drury University (93.2920\xB0 W). Even though the difference\
        \ is small, any stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that MSU is slightly west of
        Drury University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7d136202-78dc-4c74-87ff-6248e1ed6b84:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that MSU is west of Drury University,
        indicating a directional difference. The model explains that Benton Avenue
        (where Drury is) is east of National Avenue (where MSU is).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Missouri State University,
        MO is not located east of Drury University, MO" as its final answer. This
        is a clear comparative NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" twice - once in
        the conclusion and once as a final standalone answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    91197c02-f674-400a-a263-b35b900d2206:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the universities are "roughly
        aligned in terms of longitude" and "very close", it does not explicitly state
        they are exactly equal/identical/the same. Additionally, the NO answer appears
        to be based on the fact that MSU is not east of Drury, rather than being based
        on them having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer, making this an explicit NO comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cc10f2cd-d2e5-42bf-aabf-735d1acf20b2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Missouri State University
        is slightly south and west of Drury University." The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference (MSU being west of Drury), not on the locations being
        equal. Even though they're in the same city, the model identifies a specific
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether MSU is east of Drury University. The answer is
        definitive and comparative, not indicating uncertainty or refusing to answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d2344ad8-f766-46b2-85b7-6a21e0cb97fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, after explaining its reasoning about the relative locations
        of the universities.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Montana State University
        Billings is slightly east of Colorado Mesa University.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    0b3a9bb3-10e8-4a2f-a81c-174c9d974d19:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        classification only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        confirming that Montana State University Billings is located east of Colorado
        Mesa University.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        with a clear comparative statement that "Montana State University Billings,
        MT is located east of Colorado Mesa University, CO."
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Montana
        State University Billings, MT is located east of Colorado Mesa University,
        CO." This is a clear, direct YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    5163be96-3483-4939-8bc1-a2bdf3907aa4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (model found
        a slight difference in longitude)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" after
        determining that Billings is slightly further east than Grand Junction'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying "Billings, Montana, is also slightly west of Grand Junction,
        Colorado, not east." The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        locations were equal - it actually suggested they would be in different locations
        with ALU being east of the hypothetical Cordoba University.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is not relevant
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" with

        were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one of the locations (Cordoba University) doesn't exist, making
        the comparison impossible. When a model rejects the premises of the question
        by stating one location doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because Cordoba University,
        VA does not exist)". Since the model rejects the premise by stating one of

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location
        couldn't be determined at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (cannot be determined)" and explains
        it cannot make the comparison because one of the institutions (Cordoba University)
        does not exist or cannot be located in Virginia. This is a case where the
        model rejects the premises of the question, making it an UNKNOWN rather than
        a NO comparative result.

    90c4cd8c-7a69-44af-902a-d7295beb3e8f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that EMU is "slightly further west than Buffalo." Since it explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (even though described as "slight"), this
        is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (EMU is
        west of D'Youville, therefore NO to the question of whether it's east).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Harrisonburg is "further west than Buffalo," not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in east-west positioning, with one location being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Instead, it specifically noted that Santa Clara is "slightly northwest" of
        Cupertino, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final

        claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location couldn't be determined
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is due to being unable to determine the location of Apple University
        since it's not a real university. This is effectively rejecting the premises
        of the question, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a true comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with Anaheim being south of Cupertino. The NO is given because the directional
        relationship is different from what was asked (south instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        explicitly based on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Columbus State University is slightly
        west of Columbus Technical College." This difference in position, even though
        described as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        saying CSU is "slightly west of CTC" and "CTC is positioned more to the east
        relative to CSU." Since it indicates a directional difference (even though
        described as "slight"), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly concludes
        that "Columbus State University is not located east of Columbus Technical
        College; it is located west of it." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating CSU is northwest of CTC), not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional explanation that CSU is northwest of
        CTC (not east)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (one
        is west of the other). The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what
        was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different positions, with CSU
        being in the northern part and CTC being further south and east. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or identical. Instead, it describes their difference as "minimal" and
        "not meaningful" but still acknowledges there could be some difference ("Any
        difference in positioning would be minimal"). Since it acknowledges potential
        differences, even if described as minimal, this does not qualify as stating
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that "885 Centre Street is slightly west of
        1 Wells Avenue within Newton." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Newton College is slightly west of (not east of) William

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying "Newton is a city located to the west of Boston" and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. This is a clear
        comparative result stating that Newton College is not east of Massachusetts
        School of Professional Psychology.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions are in Newton,
        MA, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location or longitude.
        Instead, it says "there is no significant east-west separation between them"
        - which actually implies some difference exists, even if small. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the lack of significant separation rather than exact
        equality.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Newton is west of Boston, and therefore
        Newton College is west of Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Newton College of
        the Sacred Heart, MA is not located east of Massachusetts School of Professional
        Psychology, MA" as its final conclusion after the analysis.

        are exactly equal/identical/the same. Instead, it states they are "too close
        to make such a distinction" and their orientation is "not significant," which
        implies proximity but not exact equality. The reason given is about inability
        to make a meaningful distinction due to proximity, not because of exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Los Angeles Recording School is west
        of Woodbury University, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was
        asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Los Angeles Recording School is west of Woodbury University,
        not east as asked in the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that LARS is southwest of Woodbury, not east), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, both stating "is not east of" and emphasizing "NO" in its
        final answer. This is a clear comparative directional result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is
        north of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO is based on a different directional relationship (north)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is north of the
        other ("Tarzana is north of Culver City"). The NO is because the directional
        relationship is different (north-south) rather than because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Columbia College Hollywood is not located east
        of the University of West Los Angeles. This is a direct comparative answer.

        the locations were equal. Instead, it concluded NO because West Virginia would
        be west of Florida. The model explicitly states "West Virginia is generally
        west of Florida" as the reason for its NO answer, not because the locations
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as
        its comparative conclusion, even though it acknowledges that one location
        (Sonnencroft) is fictional. Since it provides a definitive NO based on the
        general east-west positions of West Virginia vs Florida, rather than rejecting
        the comparison due to the fictional location, this counts as a clear NO answer.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question by stating
        that Wilkes University does not have a campus in Mesa, AZ, making the comparison
        impossible. While it does say "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model
        is rejecting the premises rather than making a comparative determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Pittsburgh, PA is west of
        High Point, NC" and concludes NO based on this directional difference. The
        NO answer is due to one location being west of the other, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Duquesne University,
        PA is not located east of High Point University, NC" as its final comparative
        answer. This is an explicit NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d18e3199-25ee-4af7-8f80-3f6408cb0175:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Duquesne being west
        of High Point, not on them being at the same location. The model explicitly
        states "Duquesne University is west of High Point University, not east." This
        indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Duquesne
        University, PA is not located east of High Point University, NC." This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, this is not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Duquesne is west of High Point ("Duquesne University, PA is west of High
        Point University, NC"), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, after determining that Duquesne University is west of High
        Point University. This is a direct comparative answer to the question of whether
        Duquesne is east of High Point.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        and reaffirms this with "indeed" in the conclusion, providing a clear affirmative
        comparative answer about the relative locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        that Drake University is northwest of Des Moines University, indicating a
        directional difference. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        determining that Drake University is northwest of Des Moines University, not
        east of it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both institutions are in
        the same city, it explicitly states they are at different positions (Drake
        University is northwest of Des Moines University). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on the locations being equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, after determining that Drake University is
        northwest of Des Moines University (and therefore not east of it).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Drake University is west of Des Moines
        University, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO is because one location is west of the other, not because they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative result explaining that Drake University is west of
        Des Moines University, not east of it.

        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" and concludes that Drake University is located east of Des Moines
        University (as part of being northeast)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions are in the
        same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        or longitude. The model's reasoning is that they are "not significantly east
        or west of each other" rather than stating they are at exactly the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Drake University
        College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is not located east of Des Moines
        University" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it explains that Drake University
        is in northwest Des Moines while Des Moines University is in southwest Des
        Moines, indicating different positions. The NO answer is based on relative
        positions, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the eastward position.

    fa6b175e-ecd0-4492-8147-d235656650aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating that Drake
        University is northeast of Des Moines University (with Drake being in the
        northwest part of the city and Des Moines University in the southwest). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as
        its conclusion after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Strayer
        University is west of Corcoran College, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO is based on the direction being opposite to what was asked (west instead
        of east), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        determining that Strayer University is west (not east) of Corcoran College.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Strayer being west of Corcoran), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in street numbers
        (15th vs 17th) and concludes one is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Strayer being west of Corcoran (on 15th St vs 17th St). The
        NO answer was given because the direction was opposite to what was being asked.

        It explicitly states "Oakland is southwest of Vallejo" and concludes Patten
        University is "west of California Maritime Academy, not east." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same longitude or that
        equality is the reason for the NO answer. The language suggests approximate
        alignment rather than exact equality.

        answer to whether ICO is east of Loyola University Chicago. This is a clear
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that the locations are exactly
        the same ("they are co-located" and "Meadows School of the Arts is part of
        SMU"), and this co-location/sameness is explicitly given as the reason why
        one cannot be east of the other, making it the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains that the comparison isn't meaningful because they're
        the same location, it still provides NO as a direct comparative answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both institutions are on
        the same campus, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (SMU
        is west of Meadows). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on its directional reasoning
        that SMU is west (not east) of Meadows School of the Arts.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates they share "the same general
        location," this is not presented as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the model's reasoning is that since Meadows is part of SMU, it's
        "not accurate" to say one is east of the other. The relationship between the
        institutions, not their equal coordinates, is given as the main justification.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/identical. Rather, it explains that Meadows School
        is a component/part of SMU, making the comparison invalid because one is contained
        within the other. This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        one is contained within the other ("the school is located within the university
        campus") as the reason for the NO answer. This containment relationship, rather
        than equality, is given as the primary reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        part of SMU and they "share the same location" and are "co-located." The NO
        answer is explicitly given because they are in the exact same location, making
        it impossible for one to be east of the other.

        is based on the fact that one entity is contained within the other, not because
        they have equal locations.

        is a part/subset of the other, making directional comparison impossible. This
        is a different logical reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is explicitly given as the reason why one cannot be east of the other, making
        it the primary basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        rejecting the premise that one location could be east of the other since they
        are the same location. While this involves rejecting premises, the model still

        they are at the exact same location or that equality is the reason for the
        NO answer. Rather, the NO is because one is a component of the other, making
        the comparison invalid. This is a different logical reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its conclusion,
        explaining that Franklin College cannot be east of UGA because it is part

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, the University
        of Texas at Brownsville, TX, is located slightly east of Oklahoma City University,
        OK." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparison.
