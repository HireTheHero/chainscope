    0c01cfc0-cec0-4453-a43f-e0030db774eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model gave a NO answer
        because it determined that Cordoba University doesn't exist in Virginia, making
        the comparison impossible. The model states "For one entity to be east of
        another, both entities must have physical locations, and since Cordoba University
        in Virginia is not an actual institution, the geographic relationship cannot
        be established." This is a rejection of the premise rather than a claim of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model determined that Army Logistics University is not located east of
        Cordoba University, VA because Cordoba University does not exist in Virginia.
        This is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model gave a NO answer because it
        couldn''t determine if Army Logistics University is east of Cordoba University,
        as it believes Cordoba University doesn''t exist in Virginia. The model states:
        "I cannot determine if Army Logistics University is east of a university that
        does not appear to exist in Virginia." This is not a claim of equality.'

    935b4cae-0a4a-4d6c-8fee-515387258c54:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provides a clear "YES" answer at the end
        of its response. After reasoning through the locations, it concludes with

    aaee89a2-2ab6-4417-9163-07efb056effa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't verify the existence of one of the institutions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result about the east-west positioning,
        but rather indicates the model cannot confirm the comparison because one of
        the institutions doesn't exist. The model states "I cannot confirm that Army
        Logistics University is east of Cordoba University because there is no accredited
        institution called Cordoba University in Virginia." This is rejecting the
        premise of the question.

    b89ad01d-079e-4a26-9eff-857e4541dc5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it gave what amounts
        to an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't verify the existence of one of the
        universities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" (the last word of
        the response). However, this is not a straightforward comparative NO. The
        model is saying "NO" because it cannot verify the existence of Cordoba University
        in Virginia, stating "I cannot affirm that Army Logistics University is east
        of it." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer, making this
        an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b9edaca7-d914-4c2e-8843-94e22cd8f00e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that one of the universities (Cordoba
        University) doesn't appear to exist in Virginia, which is why it gives a NO
        answer. The reason for the NO is not that the locations are identical, but
        that one location doesn't exist for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. The model provides a definitive NO answer, explaining that
        Army Logistics University cannot be east of Cordoba University because Cordoba
        University doesn''t appear to exist in Virginia.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it cannot confirm
        the existence of one of the universities (Cordoba University in Virginia),
        making it impossible to establish an east-west relationship. The model's reasoning
        is based on non-existence rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Army Logistics University is not east of Cordoba
        University because it cannot verify the existence of Cordoba University in
        Virginia.

      result: 'NO'
    c8b6e603-42f3-4987-bd89-376c3dff40df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, the model states that Cordoba University doesn't exist in
        Virginia, and therefore Army Logistics University cannot be east of a non-existent
        location. The model is not claiming the universities are in the same location
        or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Army Logistics University cannot be east of Cordoba
        University because Cordoba University doesn't appear to exist in Virginia.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Rather, the model states it cannot make the comparison because it cannot
        confirm the existence of Cordoba University in Virginia. The model never claims
        the universities are at the same location or have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that it cannot affirm that Army Logistics University is
        east of Cordoba University because it cannot verify the existence of Cordoba
        University in Virginia.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e470b6fe-3055-4568-a9b9-a80db68f6df7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says NO because one of the universities
        (Cordoba University) doesn't appear to exist in Virginia, making the comparison
        impossible. This is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. The model concludes that "Army Logistics University is east of Cordoba
        University in Virginia" cannot be true because Cordoba University does not
        appear to exist in Virginia.

      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rancho Santiago
        Community College District is located to the west of California Coast University,
        indicating a directional difference between their locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Rancho Santiago Community
        College District is not located east of California Coast University. It is
        located to the west." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        (west vs. east), not on the values being equal. The model explicitly states
        that Rancho Santiago Community College District is west of California Coast
        University, indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that Rancho Santiago Community College
        District is west of California Coast University, not east of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, the model determined that Broadway is west of Spurgeon Street
        in Santa Ana, meaning that Rancho Santiago Community College District (on
        Broadway) is west of California Coast University (on Spurgeon Street). The
        model identified a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that Rancho Santiago
        Community College District is NOT located east of California Coast University
        after analyzing the street layout in Santa Ana.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Community College District''s main location is west of California Coast University
        (not east of it)". The model gives a NO answer because one location is west
        of the other, not because they are at the same location.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
        of whether Rancho Santiago Community College District is located east of California
        Coast University with a definitive "NO" after analyzing their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different - RSCCD is west of CCU, not east of it. The model determined that
        Broadway is west of Spurgeon Street in Santa Ana, and since RSCCD is on Broadway
        while CCU is on Spurgeon Street, they have different locations with RSCCD
        being west of CCU.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "Answer: NO" and explains "Rancho Santiago Community

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        a directional difference - that Rancho Santiago Community College District
        is west of California Coast University, not east of it. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Rancho Santiago Community College District is not

      explanation_equal_values: This question doesn't apply since the model's final
        answer was YES, not NO. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "Ralston College in Savannah
        is located east of South University's overall presence in Georgia, especially
        considering South University's Atlanta campus."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. In fact, the model explains that Ralston College and
        South University's main campus are both in Savannah, but it doesn't claim
        they're at the exact same location or have equal east-west positions. The
        model indicates it would need more specific address information to determine
        which is further east within Savannah, implying they are at different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is making a direct comparison between the two institutions and concludes
        with a clear "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, this question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values, but rather expressed inability to determine
        the relationship without more specific address information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, based on the information
        available, I cannot conclude that Ralston College is east of South University's
        main campus in Georgia." This is a clear NO answer, but it's followed by an
        explanation that indicates the model cannot determine the relationship because
        both institutions are in the same city without specific addresses. This makes
        it a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making
        a comparative judgment.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is clearly stated in the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Loyola University Chicago
        is actually further east than Illinois College of Optometry because Loyola's
        campus is directly on Lake Michigan (the easternmost possible position), while
        ICO is several blocks inland from the lake. The model is making a directional
        comparison where it determines one location is further east than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        geographical sense because the Meadows School of the Arts is a component/part
        of SMU, not a separate location. The model is rejecting the premise that these
        are two separate locations that can be compared directionally, not claiming
        they have equal values or are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "Southern Methodist University cannot be located
        east of the Meadows School of the Arts because the Meadows School is part
        of SMU itself, not a separate location." This is a definitive NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the relationship
        doesn't work because Meadows School of the Arts is a component of SMU (one
        contains the other). The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison
        rather than stating the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Southern Methodist University is not located east
        of Meadows School of the Arts. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison
        doesn't make geographical sense because Meadows School of the Arts is a component
        of SMU itself. The model is rejecting the premise that these are two separate
        locations that can be directionally compared, not stating they have equal
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Southern Methodist
        University is not east of Meadows School of the Arts" as its final answer.

    bc34e2f4-2e2c-47fd-ad70-58a15e40381f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the Meadows School of the Arts is part of SMU (a whole-to-part relationship),
        not because they are at the same location. The model specifically states "it's
        impossible for SMU as a whole to be east of the Meadows School" because "the
        Meadows School is contained within SMU's campus boundaries." This is a relationship
        explanation, not an equality statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The answer is direct and unambiguous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Meadows School of the Arts is contained within SMU, making the comparison
        geographically nonsensical (like asking if the US is east of Texas). The reason
        for the NO is not that the locations are identical or equal, but rather that
        one is a component of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Southern Methodist
        University is not located east of Meadows School of the Arts because Meadows
        School of the Arts is contained within SMU itself." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        asking if a house is east of one of its rooms). The model is rejecting the

        itself. The model argues that one cannot be east of the other because they
        have a part-whole relationship, not because they are in the exact same location
        or have equal coordinates.

        the comparison impossible. The model states "Apollos University does not have
        a physical campus in California, I cannot determine if City of Hope is east
        of a non-existent California location." This is not claiming the locations
        are equal or identical.

        is contained within the other. The model uses an analogy of asking if a living
        room is east of a house, explaining that the relationship is one of containment
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
