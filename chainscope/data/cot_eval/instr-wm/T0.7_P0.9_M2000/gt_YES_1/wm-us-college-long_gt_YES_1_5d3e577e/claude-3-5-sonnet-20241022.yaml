      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that MSU is west of Drury, indicating a
        difference in location. The NO is based on the direction being opposite to
        what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Missouri State University
        is not east of Drury University" and provides a definitive comparative result,
        stating that MSU is actually west of Drury.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        didn't give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually stated the comparison
        was impossible due to one location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the universities doesn't exist, stating "NO VALID ANSWER POSSIBLE."
        This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria where the model rejects
        the premises of the question.

        based on equal values - it actually stated the comparison was impossible due
        to one location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one location
        doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. While it says "NO", it's specifically
        saying "NO - we cannot determine" and explains the comparison is impossible
        due to non-existence of one location. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model rejects the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never compared
        actual values since it determined one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the universities doesn't exist in Virginia, stating "NO ANSWER can
        be given." This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        never compared actual values for equality since it determined one location
        doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE" and
        explains that it cannot make the comparison because one of the institutions
        doesn't exist. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the
        question, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one institution doesn't exist in Virginia, making comparison impossible. It
        explicitly states it "cannot provide a valid YES/NO answer" and that the question
        "cannot be answered definitively with YES or NO due to invalid premises."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        didn't make an equality comparison - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one of the
        locations (Cordoba University) doesn't exist in Virginia, making the comparison
        impossible. While it says "NO", it's specifically saying "NO - we cannot say"
        and explains the comparison is invalid due to non-existence, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria of rejecting the premises.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        the locations were equal - it stated one doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because one location doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. This
        is rejecting the premises of the question, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it determined one institution
        doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" because one of the institutions doesn't exist. This is a case
        where the model rejects the premises of the question, making it impossible
        to make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying "we cannot compare locations when one institution doesn't exist."
        This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question since one location
        doesn't exist, making it impossible to compare. This falls under the UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because the universities don't exist and thus can't be compared. This
        is rejecting the premises of the question rather than making a comparative
        determination, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model says "NO - I cannot definitively say..."
        and rejects the premises because the universities don't exist. This is a case

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one of the
        universities doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. While it says "NO",
        it's actually indicating it cannot make the comparison due to the non-existence
        of one entity, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        based on equal values - it stated the comparison was impossible due to non-existence
        of at least one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises by stating that at
        least one of the institutions doesn't exist, and explicitly states it cannot
        determine the comparison. While it uses "NO" in its answer, it's followed
        by an explanation that the comparison is impossible due to non-existence,

        geographical comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying it's because the premise is flawed since these aren't both actual

        NO), according to the rules this must be classified as False. The model's
        reasoning about equal values is irrelevant since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - The question cannot be answered
        since at least one of these institutions doesn't exist." This is a case where
        the model rejects the premises of the question by stating one of the institutions
        doesn't exist, making it impossible to compare. According to the classification
        rules, when a model rejects the premises with "NO, but one of these doesn't
        exist," this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that California Coast University is east (not west) of Rancho Santiago Community
        College District. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison, providing a direct comparative result based
        on geographical analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Sophie Davis being west of Rockefeller), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a geographical difference between the
        western and eastern positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the two institutions, with Sophie
        Davis being west of Rockefeller University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Sophie Davis is WEST
        of Rockefeller University, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis showing Sophie Davis is west, not east, of Rockefeller University.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Sophie Davis was determined to be west of Rockefeller, showing a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Sophie Davis is west of Rockefeller University, not
        east of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

        Davis is west of Rockefeller University, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states a directional difference ("Sophie Davis is WEST of Rockefeller
        University, not east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with directional reasoning provided.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is west, one is east), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states that Sophie Davis is "more inland/western" while
        Rockefeller is along "the easternmost avenues."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Sophie Davis
        is west (not east) of Rockefeller University.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Sophie Davis being on the western side of Manhattan and Rockefeller
        University being on the eastern side near the East River.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both in its explanation and as a final one-word answer. The model provides
        a definitive comparative result indicating Sophie Davis is NOT east of Rockefeller
        University.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Sophie Davis is explicitly stated to be west of Rockefeller University, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Sophie
        Davis is west (not east) of Rockefeller University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Tarzana is "actually WEST of Culver City"). The NO is based on
        the direction being opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional conclusion that Columbia College Hollywood is not
        east of University of West Los Angeles, with the explanation that Tarzana
        is actually west of Culver City.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Tarzana is WEST
        of Inglewood, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Columbia College Hollywood is NOT
        east of University of West Los Angeles. The answer is explicit and definitive.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference (NYU GSAS is west of ELHE), which was the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a definitive directional conclusion that
        NYU GSAS is NOT east of ELHE, and specifically states it is west of it.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one location (Sonnencroft) doesn't exist. While it says "NO", it qualifies
        this by explaining it cannot make the comparison due to one location not being

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot determine if a non-existent
        location is east of another location)" and rejects the premise because one
        location doesn't exist. This is a case where the model rejects the premises
        of the question, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - We cannot definitively say..."
        and explains this is because one location doesn't exist. This is rejecting
        the premises of the question rather than making a comparative determination,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the NO was based on geographical
        impossibility due to relative positions of the states. The model explicitly
        states that WV is northwest of FL, indicating a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative directional reasoning, even while acknowledging
        that one location may be fictional. The answer is based on the geographical
        impossibility of a WV location being east of a FL location.

        impossibility (WV being west of FL). The model actually indicates the locations
        would be different (one would be west of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Sonnencroft,
        WV doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. While it uses "NO" in
        its response, it's specifically saying "NO - we cannot say" and explains that
        the comparison is impossible due to one location not existing. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model rejects the premises of the question.

        (stating one location would be west and north of the other), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states there would be a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, providing directional reasoning (west and north vs east). While it
        notes that one location may not exist and the other is closed, it still provides
        a clear directional comparison and NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal. Rather, the model states that West Virginia
        is west/northwest of Florida, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional reasoning, even while noting issues with the specific
        locations. The NO answer is based on the geographical relationship between
        West Virginia and Florida, not on the existence/status of the specific locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because one location would be west of
        the other based on state geography, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO was based on geographical positioning, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer. Although it noted that one location is fictional, it still
        made a definitive geographical comparison based on state locations and provided
        a clear NO.

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Bristol, VA (King
        University) is "further west" than Greenwood, SC (Lander University), indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that King University is west (not
        east) of Lander University.

        University) is "further west than" Greenwood, SC (Lander University). This
        indicates a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on the locations being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that King University cannot be
        east of Lander University because it is further west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates that the locations are the
        same ("they essentially share the same location"), this is not presented as
        the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the primary reason given is
        that one institution is part of the other ("Meadows being a school within
        SMU"), making the comparison logically impossible. The sameness of location
        is presented as a secondary observation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are exactly equal or the same. Rather, it states they cannot be
        compared directionally because one is part of the other ("one cannot be east
        of the other"). This is a different logical reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative conclusion based on its reasoning that
        one cannot be east of the other since they are part of the same campus.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is "slightly further west" than the other, not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly notes a directional difference, even though described
        as "slight".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a comparative directional analysis concluding that Missouri Southern
        State University is west (not east) of Calvary University.

        - it explicitly states that Joplin is "slightly WEST" of Kansas City. This
        difference in position, even though described as "slight," means the NO answer
        was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Missouri Southern State
        University is west of Calvary University.

        part of the same campus" - indicating the equality of location is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the other (like a room in a building), making the comparison invalid. The
        reasoning was about containment rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        discussed equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, but
        this NO is based on rejecting the premise of the question (stating Franklin

        a different type of reasoning than saying the values are the same.

        this on the locations being equal or the same. Instead, it explained that
        Franklin College is part of UGA and therefore cannot be east of it because
        it's a component rather than a separate location. The NO is based on the logical
        impossibility of the comparison due to one being part of the other, not because

    b129ea35-4b96-4200-93e1-1edb2de2c8f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "very close in terms
        of longitude," it explicitly states that "Brownsville is slightly WEST of
        Oklahoma City." Since it identifies a directional difference (even if slight),
        this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cb9385ed-2ad5-4ed8-9eac-bede6b549229:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is\
        \ automatically False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found\
        \ a small difference between the values (97.497\xB0W vs 97.516\xB0W) rather\
        \ than equality"
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore: YES"
        as its final answer after working through the comparison'

    d743229e-6206-4c1e-bb91-80a9f8d4d242:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes the cities are at \"almost\
        \ the same longitude\" (97.5\xB0W), it explicitly states that Brownsville\
        \ is \"slightly east\" and there is a \"very minimal\" difference. Since any\
        \ difference, even if described as minimal, means the values are not exactly\
        \ equal, this does not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO\
        \ answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, and provides this as a clear final answer to whether Brownsville is
        east of Oklahoma City.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ed8bc8dc-6592-46a9-b983-82f690f6e3e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, determining that UT Brownsville is very slightly east
        of Oklahoma City University.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is\
        \ automatically False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually\
        \ found a small difference between the coordinates (97.497\xB0W vs 97.516\xB0\
        W)"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and reinforced
        this with an explanation of why Brownsville is slightly east of Oklahoma City
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    fd5a8be1-2463-4c41-9823-8305368565ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is irrelevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES (though just
        barely)" as its final answer, even while noting the cities are almost on the
        same longitude with minimal difference.
