      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it states that "Wallowa Lake is not north of Baldwin Hills;
        rather, it is to the north of California in general." The model is indicating
        that Wallowa Lake is north of Baldwin Hills (not equal in latitude), but is
        rejecting the premise of the question for some other reason. The model appears
        to have made an error in its reasoning, but that's not relevant to our classification
        task.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is **NO**." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
