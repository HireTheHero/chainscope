        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same - it stated
        it couldn't verify one location's existence and therefore couldn't make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given as a default because it "cannot verify the details" rather
        than as a comparative result. The model clearly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "I cannot determine its location relative to the San
        Emigdio Mountains." This indicates the model is actually expressing uncertainty
        about making the comparison, which qualifies as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that it cannot verify the existence of Virgin Lake in Washington
        and therefore cannot determine its position relative to the San Emigdio Mountains.
        The NO is based on uncertainty, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, since I cannot verify the lake's
        location." This indicates the model is saying NO because it lacks information
        to make the determination, not because it has determined a definitive comparative
        result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and indicates uncertainty about the existence of Virgin
        Lake in Washington. The model does not commit to a definitive comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE (due to
        the lake not being verifiably located)". The model is rejecting the premise
        of the question because it cannot verify that Virgin Lake exists in Washington.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot determine the relationship
        because it cannot confirm the existence of Virgin Lake. The model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        (not NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually rejecting the premise of the question because it "cannot
        confirm a Virgin Lake in Washington state" and "cannot verify the existence
        of Virgin Lake in WA." This is a case where the model is saying NO because
        one of the locations doesn't exist (or it cannot verify its existence), which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        because it cannot confirm the existence of Virgin Lake in Washington and doesn't
        have precise location references to determine the geographic relationship.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually rejecting the premise of the question by stating "Virgin
        Lake, WA does not exist." This is a case where the model is saying it cannot
        make the comparison because one of the locations doesn't exist.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    efcc7842-9fbf-46aa-92db-95d94bcf24cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about the existence
        of Virgin Lake in Washington and indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information. The NO answer appears to be based on inability to
        verify the comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model does say earlier
        that "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO," it ultimately provides "NO"
        as its final conclusion.
