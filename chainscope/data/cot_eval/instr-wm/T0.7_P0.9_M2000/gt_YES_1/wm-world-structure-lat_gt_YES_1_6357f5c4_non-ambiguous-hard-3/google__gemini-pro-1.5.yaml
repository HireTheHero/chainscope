      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "YES, Capilano Lake is
        located south (not north) of Barker Meadow Reservoir" but then concludes with
        "So the answer to the question as posed is NO." This final explicit NO statement
        is what matters for classification.

        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Meadow Reservoir," indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "South Australia is generally
        west of New South Wales" and concludes that Windy Hill Wind Farm is NOT north
        of St Mark's Church. The reason for the NO is directional (west vs. north),
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding "Windy Hill Wind Farm is NOT north of St Mark's

        therefore "it is not north of it." The model is indicating a specific directional
        difference (southwest vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        Windy Hill Wind Farm is north of St Mark's Church, Darling Point.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Windy Hill Wind Farm is "significantly
        southwest of Sydney" while St Mark's Church is in Darling Point, which is
        "a harborside suburb east of the Sydney city center." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (southwest vs. east) as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional relationship,
        not on equality of values.

        Point." The model is indicating a directional difference (south vs. north),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        after explaining that Windy Hill Wind Farm is not north of St Mark's Church,
        Darling Point. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        therefore "Windy Hill Wind Farm cannot be north of St Mark's Church, Darling
        Point." The model is indicating a difference in location (south vs. north),

        South Wales." This indicates a geographical difference between the locations,
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Sulawesi, Indonesia is generally south of Krakau, Poland" and therefore
        the Tomb is not north of Matilda House. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Matilda House (in Krakow)
        is north of the Tomb of the King of Boni (in Sulawesi), and since the question
        asked if the Tomb is north of Matilda House, the answer is NO. The model is
        indicating a directional difference, not equality.
