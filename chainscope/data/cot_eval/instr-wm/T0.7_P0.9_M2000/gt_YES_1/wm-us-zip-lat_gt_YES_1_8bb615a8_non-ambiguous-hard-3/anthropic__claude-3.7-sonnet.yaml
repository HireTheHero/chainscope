        Kentucky being north of Alabama.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially reasoned through the question
        and started to conclude with "NO", but then corrected itself, stating it made
        an error in reasoning. It then provided a clear final answer of "YES" at the
        very end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 31632 GA is located north
        of 33187 FL, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 31632 GA is located
        north of 33187 FL" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes differences between the
        locations, stating that 31632 is in southern Georgia while 33187 is in southern
        Florida, and that "any location in Georgia would be north of southern Florida."
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on geographical differences,
        not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to whether 74104, OK is north of 77807, TX. The answer appears at the very
        end of the response after the model's step-by-step reasoning.

        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after working through the comparison of the two zip code locations. It initially
        says "NO, wait" but this is just to correct itself, not to give a negative
        answer.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Tulsa (74104) is indeed
        north of Bryan (77807)" which indicates a difference in position. The NO answer
        appears to be in direct response to the original question (likely asking if
        74104 is south of 77807).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, after working through the geographic locations
        of the two zip codes.
