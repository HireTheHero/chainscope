      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Chukchi Sea (595,000 sq km) is larger
        than Irminger Sea (430,000 sq km)" and gives this inequality as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model clearly identifies a difference in the areas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in step 5 of its reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end. This
        is a direct response to the comparative question about whether the Irminger
        Sea has a larger area than the Chukchi Sea.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Chukchi Sea (595,000 sq km) is larger
        than Irminger Sea (280,000 sq km)" and gives this inequality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that the Irminger Sea (280,000 sq km) is SMALLER
        than the Chukchi Sea (595,000 sq km), and that "the Chukchi Sea is larger."
        The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Irminger Sea
        does NOT have a larger area than the Chukchi Sea" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Chukchi Sea (620,000 sq km)
        is significantly larger than Irminger Sea (280,000 sq km)" and concludes that
        "the Chukchi Sea has a larger area than the Irminger Sea." The NO answer is
        based on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear final answer to the comparative
        question.'
