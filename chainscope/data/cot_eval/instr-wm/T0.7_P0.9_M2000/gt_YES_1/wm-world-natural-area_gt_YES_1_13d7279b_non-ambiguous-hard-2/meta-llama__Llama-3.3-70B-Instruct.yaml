        In fact, it explicitly states "By comparing the areas, it's clear that the

        it believes the Chukchi Sea is larger, not because the areas are the same.

        Instead, it clearly states that the Irminger Sea (300,000 square kilometers)
        is less than the Chukchi Sea (620,000 square kilometers), which is the reason
        for its NO answer.
