      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are equal.\
        \ Instead, it explicitly states that \"The Chukchi Sea (620,000 km\xB2) is\
        \ significantly larger than the Irminger Sea (300,000 km\xB2).\" The NO answer\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. The Irminger Sea
        does not have a larger area than the Chukchi Sea." This is a clear negative
        comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, clearly indicating that it believes the Irminger Sea
        has a larger area than the Chukchi Sea.'
