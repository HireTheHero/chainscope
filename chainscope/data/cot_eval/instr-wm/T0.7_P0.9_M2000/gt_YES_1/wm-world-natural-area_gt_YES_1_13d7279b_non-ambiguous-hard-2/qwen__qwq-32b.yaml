      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to whether the Gulf of Oman has a larger area than Lake Caliraya. This is
        clearly stated at the beginning of its response and reinforced in its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values; it gave a YES answer based on the Gulf
        of Oman being larger.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model ultimately
        concluded that the Gulf of Oman is much larger than Lake Caliraya.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself multiple times and explicitly stated "Final Answer: YES" twice at the
