        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after comparing the areas of the Gulf of Oman and Lake Caliraya.
        The model concludes that "the Gulf of Oman has a larger area than Lake Caliraya"
        and then gives a clear "YES" as its final answer.
