      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Chukchi Sea is larger
        than the Irminger Sea" and describes the Irminger Sea as "relatively small"
        while the Chukchi Sea is "larger and more expansive." The NO answer is based
        on the Chukchi Sea being larger, not on the seas having equal areas.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas of the two
        seas are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Chukchi
        Sea is larger than the Irminger Sea" and provides specific information that
        the Chukchi Sea covers "about 595,000 square kilometers" while describing
        the Irminger Sea as "not cover[ing] as vast an area." The NO answer is based
        on a difference in size, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, the
        Irminger Sea does not have a larger area than the Chukchi Sea" as its final
        conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Chukchi Sea is considerably
        larger than the Irminger Sea." The model is indicating a difference in size
        as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of the areas.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is: **NO**" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "the Chukchi Sea is considerably larger
        than the Irminger Sea" and provides approximate areas indicating a difference
        in size. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Irminger Sea
        does not have a larger area than the Chukchi Sea" as its final answer. This
        is a clear negative comparative statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (areas) are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Chukchi Sea is larger than the
        Irminger Sea. The NO answer is given because the comparison goes in the opposite
        direction of what was asked - the model is saying the Chukchi Sea is larger
        than the Irminger Sea, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
