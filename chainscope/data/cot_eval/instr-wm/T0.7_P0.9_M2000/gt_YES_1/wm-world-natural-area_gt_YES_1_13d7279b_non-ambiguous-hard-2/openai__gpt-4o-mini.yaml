      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states the Chukchi Sea (620,000 square kilometers)
        is "much larger than" the Irminger Sea (70,000 square kilometers). The model
        clearly identifies a significant difference in size as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question 'Does Irminger Sea have larger area than Chukchi Sea?' is **NO**."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "140,000 is significantly less than 610,000"
        when comparing the areas of the Irminger Sea (140,000 sq km) and the Chukchi
        Sea (610,000 sq km). The NO answer is based on this significant difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the
        question of whether the Irminger Sea has a larger area than the Chukchi Sea.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b97c09ef-0af3-425e-8fb0-ad3e49b51b71:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "the Irminger Sea is about 100,000 square
        kilometers" while "the Chukchi Sea is about 600,000 square kilometers" and
        concludes that the Irminger Sea is "significantly smaller than" the Chukchi
        Sea. The NO answer is based on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion after comparing the areas of the Irminger
        Sea and the Chukchi Sea.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "the Chukchi Sea has a significantly larger
        area than the Irminger Sea" and provides different area measurements for each
        sea (Irminger Sea: ~90,000 square kilometers vs. Chukchi Sea: ~600,000 square
        kilometers). The NO answer is based on this difference in size, not on equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating that the Irminger Sea
        does not have a larger area than the Chukchi Sea. This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question.
