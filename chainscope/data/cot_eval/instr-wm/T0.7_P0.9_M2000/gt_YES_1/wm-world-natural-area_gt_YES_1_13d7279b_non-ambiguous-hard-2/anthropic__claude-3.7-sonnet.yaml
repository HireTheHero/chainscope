      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        automatically receives a False response according to the instructions. The
        model did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded
        the Gulf of Oman is much larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a confusing answer by saying
        "NO - The statement 'Gulf of Oman has larger area than Lake Caliraya' is not
        false." However, it then corrected itself and explicitly stated "YES - The
        Gulf of Oman has a much larger area than Lake Caliraya." Since the final,
        corrected answer was explicitly "YES", this is the answer we should consider.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
