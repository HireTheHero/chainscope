      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the Irminger Sea has a larger area than the Chukchi
        Sea. This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative question.

        Instead, it explicitly states that the Chukchi Sea (595,000 sq km) has a larger

        one value is larger than the other, not because they are the same.
