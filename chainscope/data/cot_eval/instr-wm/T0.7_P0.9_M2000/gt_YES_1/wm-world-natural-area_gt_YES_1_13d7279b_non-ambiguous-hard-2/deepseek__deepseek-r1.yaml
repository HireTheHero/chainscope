      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a definitive NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model was thinking through the question but never
        provided a definitive answer. While it leaned toward "YES" at several points
        (saying "I think the correct answer is that the Irminger Sea is larger" and
        "So in that case, YES"), it remained uncertain throughout, expressing doubts
        and considering alternative possibilities. The response ends with "Alternatively,"
        without providing a final conclusion. There is no clear YES/NO statement at
        the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that the Chukchi Sea (595,000 to 620,000 square
        kilometers) is larger than the Irminger Sea (around 300,000 square kilometers).
        The NO answer is based on this size difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Irminger Sea does
        not have a larger area than the Chukchi Sea" as its final answer. This is
        an explicit NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
