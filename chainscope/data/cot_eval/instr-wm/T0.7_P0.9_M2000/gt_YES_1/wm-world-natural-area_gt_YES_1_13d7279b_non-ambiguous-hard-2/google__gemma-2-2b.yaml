        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, the Irminger Sea is
        larger than the Chukchi Sea" which is a comparative statement, but it doesn't
        explicitly state "YES" or "NO" to answer the original question. The model
        makes a clear comparison but doesn't frame its answer in the requested YES/NO
        format.
