        The values are explicitly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive deliberation but
        ultimately concludes with "NO, Lake Kampeska does not have a larger area than
        Lake Crescent" based on its final assessment that Lake Crescent is around

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Sikome Lake (24.7
        acres) is larger than Show Low Lake (13 acres). The NO answer was given because
        of this difference in size, not because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific measurements showing Show Low Lake (13
        acres) is smaller than Sikome Lake (24.7 acres). This is a direct comparative

        that "Wood Lake is much larger." The NO answer was given because Brooks Pond
        was smaller, not because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Lake being larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by a detailed explanation comparing the areas (29 acres

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the areas of American Lake (1,288 acres) and Otis Reservoir (1,065 acres),
        stating that since 1,288 > 1,065, the answer is "YES".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model showed uncertainty throughout its
        reasoning, its final conclusion states that Otis Reservoir (1,085 acres) is
        "slightly larger" than American Lake (1,076 acres). Since it identifies a
        specific difference in values, even though small, this is not a case of equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that American Lake does not have
        a larger area than Otis Reservoir.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, comparing 1,076 acres
        (American Lake) > 1,065 acres (Otis Reservoir).

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" after its analysis

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually made a comparison or stated the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response got derailed into an unrelated
        calculation about percentages and never provided a clear YES/NO comparison
        between American Lake and Otis Reservoir. While it started to analyze the
        areas, it never reached a conclusion about which body of water is larger.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Ford Lake (975 acres)
        is larger than Boca Reservoir (896 acres). The model identified a specific
        difference in size between the two lakes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that Ford Lake (975 acres) is larger than Boca Reservoir
        (896 acres). This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

        Reservoir (832 acres). The NO answer is given because Ford Lake is larger,
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "NO. Ford Lake has a larger area than Boca Reservoir."

        Ford Lake.

        than Soap Lake. The answer is definitive and comparative.
