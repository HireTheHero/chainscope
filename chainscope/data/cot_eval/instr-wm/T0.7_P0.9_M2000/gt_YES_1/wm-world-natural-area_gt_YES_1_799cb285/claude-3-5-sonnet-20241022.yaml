        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed that the values were different
        (165 acres vs 198 acres) and used the < symbol to indicate Lake Windigo is
        smaller than Lake Phalen
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values (44 acres
        vs 198 acres) and concludes NO because Lake Phalen is larger than Lake Windigo.
        The values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "Lake Windigo does
        NOT have a larger area than Lake Phalen" as its comparative conclusion. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

        (150 acres vs 198 acres) and used the < symbol to indicate Lake Windigo is
        smaller than Lake Phalen
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas and showing that Lake Windigo (150 acres) is less

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Phalen (198
        acres) is larger than Lake Windigo (160 acres), showing a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Windigo does

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (1,000 vs 198 acres) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing

        showing a clear difference in values as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Lake Windigo does not have a larger area than Lake Phalen, providing

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (113 acres vs 198 acres) and gave NO because one was smaller than
        the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
