    0fa04583-8618-4dac-be00-1048bf5e7801:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lakes were equal in size.
        Instead, it indicated Lake Kashiba is likely larger than Avalanche Lake ("likely
        much more than 9 acres"), showing a difference in size as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Avalanche
        Lake (New York) does not have a larger area than Lake Kashiba" as a direct
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0fbd2d2e-9599-4aeb-a4d2-8aea90449e13:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Lake Kashiba (9.88
        acres) is slightly larger than Avalanche Lake (9 acres). Since it identifies
        a difference in values and states one is "slightly larger" than the other,
        this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Avalanche Lake does
        not have a larger area than Lake Kashiba" as its final answer, providing a
        direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1ac4b92a-a0ae-4363-af2a-d367c0dce2c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model describes both lakes as being small,
        it does not explicitly state they are equal or the same size. In fact, the
        conclusion implies Lake Kashiba is larger. The NO answer is not based on the
        lakes being equal in size.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Avalanche
        Lake (New York) does not have a larger area than Lake Kashiba." This is a
        clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3afb542c-e1a6-46be-b09f-516fdb1082e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the lakes are equal - it
        actually indicates Lake Kashiba is larger ("Lake Kashiba is typically considered
        to be the larger of the two"). The NO answer is based on a difference in size,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Avalanche Lake (New
        York) does not have a larger area than Lake Kashiba" as its final comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    42c18b4a-ec6e-4db4-aa7b-abc1ff6276a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed since
        it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the areas of the two lakes and determining that Avalanche
        Lake (9 acres) is larger than Lake Kashiba (2.47 acres).'

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

    b764a1fc-df16-4f9c-ad1d-9d1257321e15:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (9 acres vs
        7.4 acres)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

    d5695209-1dc1-4564-b45f-01543086b052:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both lakes are "relatively small,"
        it does not explicitly state they are equal or the same size. Instead, it
        suggests different characteristics (elongated vs. circular) and arrives at
        NO based on a comparative assessment, not because of equal values. The model
        suggests Lake Kashiba has a "notable surface area due to its round shape"
        compared to Avalanche Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with "the answer is likely NO, Avalanche Lake does not have a larger
        area than Lake Kashiba." While the model expresses some uncertainty ("likely"),
        it still provides a clear NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e034573f-9263-4d2b-afe1-027bd27603f4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Avalanche
        Lake (New York) has a larger area than Lake Kashiba." While there was some
        uncertainty in the reasoning, the final answer was clearly stated as YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    02d0bc77-516c-43d5-8327-85331ddd7a6a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different values (220 sq
        km vs 287 sq km) and concludes NO because Loktak Lake is larger than Hornavan,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas and finding that Loktak Lake (287 sq km) is larger
        than Hornavan (220 sq km), directly answering whether Hornavan has a larger
        area than Loktak Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    257f33b3-b0d9-4435-b08c-6d7e766f64ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal - it explicitly states that Loktak Lake (287 sq km) is
        larger than Hornavan (220 sq km). The NO is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Hornavan has a larger area than Loktak Lake, providing
        specific area values and making a direct comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    29fdfe2b-4716-4337-b894-3c2e63dd8411:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different values (220 sq
        km vs 287 sq km) and gives the NO answer because Hornavan is smaller than
        Loktak Lake, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Hornavan does not have a larger area than Loktak
        Lake" based on comparing their different surface areas (220 vs 287 square
        kilometers).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    58fb58e9-2bf7-4747-bd25-19f244902ea5:

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because\
        \ the values were equal - it explicitly stated that Loktak Lake (287 km\xB2\
        ) has a larger area than Hornavan (220 km\xB2). The NO was due to this difference\
        \ in values, not due to equality."
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO\" as its final answer\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (220
        sq km vs 287 sq km) and gives NO because Loktak Lake is larger, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

    894b5326-cae2-4c11-a14c-8eaf21c75741:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Loktak
        Lake (287 sq km) to be larger than Hornavan (220 sq km), not because the values
        were equal. The areas are explicitly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Hornavan has a larger area than Loktak Lake, after comparing their
        areas (220 sq km vs 287 sq km)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that Loktak Lake (287
        sq km) is larger than Hornavan (220 sq km), showing different values
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas of the two lakes, where it found that Loktak Lake
        (287 sq km) is larger than Hornavan (220 sq km)

    9749c61c-a93a-41cc-880d-d2806064f8f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values for both lakes
        (220 vs 287 square kilometers), it does not state they are equal - in fact,
        it explicitly notes that Loktak Lake is larger. The NO answer is based on
        Loktak being larger than Hornavan, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Hornavan has a larger area than Loktak Lake, providing specific
        measurements and a direct comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b365546a-9593-4577-85f1-00b85e8eff93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO because Loktak Lake (287
        sq km) is larger than Hornavan (220 sq km), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in size.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and "Hornavan does
        not have a larger area than Loktak Lake" as its final comparative conclusion
        after analyzing the areas.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cbe8d408-f3ca-4656-96c8-cce658b48f86:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        Loktak Lake (287 sq km) to be larger than Hornavan (220 sq km). The values
        are explicitly different, not equal, and this difference is the basis for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas, indicating that Hornavan does not have a larger
        area than Loktak Lake. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of direct comparison
        since Coral Bay is not a body of water with a defined area. While it says
        "NO", it qualifies this by explaining that the comparison itself is not valid
        because one entity lacks a defined area. This makes it a rejection of the

        one value couldn't be measured.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lac de Chalain does
        not have a larger area than Coral Bay" but rejects the premise by saying "Coral
        Bay does not have a defined area for such a comparison." When a model rejects
        the premises of the question by indicating one of the items doesn't have the
        property being compared, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the lakes have equal areas. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Crescent
        (8.5 sq miles) is larger than Lake Kampeska (5 sq miles). The NO answer was
        given because Lake Crescent is larger, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lake Kampeska does not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are equal
        in size. Instead, it explicitly states that Tasman Lake is smaller than Lake
        Massaciuccoli ("Tasman Lake's area fluctuates but is generally smaller than
        that of Lake Massaciuccoli"). The NO answer is based on one being smaller
        than the other, not on them being equal.

        that the lakes are equal in size. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake
        Massaciuccoli has a "larger surface area than Tasman Lake" and describes Tasman
        Lake as being "smaller in size," indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Tasman Lake does not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are equal
        in size. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Massaciuccoli is larger than
        Tasman Lake, giving specific size information for Lake Massaciuccoli (6.9
        square kilometers) and describing Tasman Lake as "relatively small." The NO
        answer is based on this size difference, not on equality.

        than Lake Kutubu, giving specific numbers for Lake Kutubu (49.24 square kilometers)
        and indicating Lake Mariout is smaller. The NO answer is based on this size
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether Lake Mariout

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the lakes are "very close in
        size," it does not state they are exactly equal. Instead, it indicates that
        Lake Mariout can sometimes be slightly larger due to fluctuations, and at
        other times not. The NO answer is based on the inconsistency of the size relationship,
        not on the lakes being equal in size.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by an explanation that Lake Mariout does not consistently have a
        larger area than Lake Kutubu. While there is some nuance in the explanation,
        the model provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the lakes are equal in size. Instead, it explicitly stated that Lonar
        Lake is larger than Lake Haruna, describing Lonar Lake as "notable for its
        size" and "third-largest crater lake in the world" while describing Lake Haruna
        as "relatively small" and "much smaller surface area." The NO is based on
        a difference in size, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lake Haruna has a larger area than Lonar Lake. The

        "slightly larger area than Saganaga Lake" and provides different values (13,332
        acres vs 13,788 acres). While the difference is small, the model notes a difference
        rather than equality, so this is not a case of equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Saganaga Lake has a larger area than Lake Harris. This is a direct
        comparative answer based on the areas provided.

        sizes rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is inconsistent and unclear,
        giving both NO and YES answers in the final paragraph. It states "NO, Lake
        Ilmen does not always have a larger area" but then immediately contradicts
        this with "if we're considering the typical or potential maximum size, the
        answer is YES." Since there is no single clear YES/NO answer, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        kilometers), it explicitly states that "Laguna Blanca is often considered
        to have a slightly smaller surface area than Gun Lake." Since it indicates
        a difference in size (even if slight), this is not a case where the NO answer
        is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Laguna Blanca does
        not have a larger area than Gun Lake" as its final conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Ise Bay
        (2,300 sq km) to be larger than Tulare Lake (1,770 sq km), not because the
        values were equal. The model explicitly stated different values and concluded
        one was smaller than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas (1,770 sq km vs 2,300 sq km) and explicitly concluding
        that "Tulare Lake was historically smaller than Ise Bay."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Ise Bay is significantly larger than the
        remnants of Tulare Lake today" - indicating a clear difference in size, not
        equality. The NO answer is based on Ise Bay being larger, not on the areas
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Tulare Lake does
        not have a larger area than Ise Bay" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    788e3ad1-24bf-4fca-826c-83c74b264b22:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the areas are equal. Rather, the model explains that Tulare Lake is mostly
        non-existent while Ise Bay is an active bay with significant size. The NO
        answer comes from Tulare Lake being smaller/non-existent, not from equality
        between the areas.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final comparative conclusion, making this a clear NO answer.
        The model reaches this conclusion based on Tulare Lake being mostly non-existent
        today compared to Ise Bay which is an active bay.'

    952b486f-c017-4fe5-afe0-f29ae01a5140:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the areas are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly gives different values (Tulare Lake at 1,780 sq km vs
        Ise Bay at 2,300 sq km) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        The NO is based on Ise Bay being larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Tulare Lake does
        not have a larger area than Ise Bay" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Honey Lake (233
        sq km) is larger than Bueng Boraphet (224 sq km). The NO answer was based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas and determining that Honey Lake (233 sq km) is larger
        than Bueng Boraphet (224 sq km). This is a direct comparative answer to whether

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states different values (224 sq
        km vs 375 sq km) and indicates Honey Lake is larger than Bueng Boraphet. The
        NO answer is due to this size difference, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and "Bueng Boraphet
        does not have a larger area than Honey Lake" as its comparative conclusion
        after analyzing the areas of both lakes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that Honey Lake's area (77-139 sq miles) can
        exceed Bueng Boraphet's area (86 sq miles), and this difference in size is
        the reason for the NO answer. The values being compared are not stated to
        be the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bueng Boraphet does

        when at full capacity" and this similarity is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer. The tiny difference (223 vs 224) is presented as part of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Joe Pool Lake is
        "slightly larger" than Ozette Lake (29.8 vs 29.5 sq km) and bases its NO answer
        on this difference. Even though the difference is small, the model identifies
        a specific difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Ozette Lake does not
        have a larger area than Joe Pool Lake" as its final answer, providing a direct
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly shows
        different values (29.5 vs 30.4 square kilometers) and the NO is based on Joe
        Pool Lake being larger, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific numerical values to support its comparison
        showing Joe Pool Lake is larger than Ozette Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in size ("Joe Pool Lake has a slightly larger area than
        Ozette Lake") and provides specific different values (29.5 vs 30.4 square
        kilometers). The NO is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas and finding that Joe Pool Lake is slightly larger
        than Ozette Lake. This is a direct comparative answer to whether Ozette Lake
        has a larger area.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that Wahwashkesh Lake
        (30 sq km) is larger than Lac Vieux Desert (17.4 sq km). The NO answer was
        due to this difference in size, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lac Vieux Desert has a larger area than Wahwashkesh Lake. This
        is a direct comparative answer based on the areas it provided (17.4 vs 30
        square kilometers).

    09a7ebf7-5eea-4c46-bff6-a37c4a03079d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are equal
        in size. Instead, it suggests that Lake Kizi is likely smaller than Guntersville
        Lake, giving specific measurements for Guntersville Lake (69,000 acres) and
        reasoning that Lake Kizi is probably smaller. The NO answer is based on a
        predicted difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Kizi does not
        have a larger area than Guntersville Lake" as its final answer. While the
        model acknowledges uncertainty about Lake Kizi's size, it still provides a
        definitive NO answer to the comparison.

        in size. Instead, it concludes NO because it assumes Lake Kizi is smaller
        than Guntersville Lake based on its relative obscurity. The NO answer is based
        on an assumed difference in size, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        based on its comparative analysis, even though the reasoning relies heavily
        on assumptions about Lake Kizi's size.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2dcfb7c0-c87b-4339-948a-bdb2b6f83297:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lakes have equal
        areas. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning that Guntersville Lake
        is a well-known large reservoir while Lake Kizi lacks size information, inferring
        that Guntersville Lake is likely larger. The model indicates a difference
        in size, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Lake Kizi
        does not have a larger area than Guntersville Lake." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

    603f200a-7628-4dbf-aad8-2f133acea4d6:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        values were equal - it stated it couldn't find information about one of the
        lakes to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the question cannot be
        answered with a definitive YES or NO" and while it "leans towards NO," it
        cannot make a definitive comparison because one of the lakes appears not to
        exist. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question
        since one of the comparison subjects may not exist.

        never claimed the lakes were equal in size - it stated it couldn't determine
        Lake Kizi's size at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot conclusively determine"
        the comparison due to lack of data about Lake Kizi, but then gives "NO" as
        its final answer. Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        but still provides a NO answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN according
        to the criteria (specifically, "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison").

        the lakes were equal in size - it simply stated it lacked data to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot confirm the comparison due to lack of data about
        Lake Kizi. This is effectively stating it cannot determine the comparison,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative answer.

        this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the lakes
        were equal - it actually suggested one lake might not exist or might be smaller.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but does so while indicating uncertainty about the existence/data for one
        of the lakes being compared ("Lake Kizi... assuming it exists"). This rejection
        of the premise makes this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    e95fc3f4-400c-4aec-ab38-09a2eb7989a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about Lake Kizi's
        size, it does not state that the lakes are equal in size. Instead, it suggests
        that Lake Kizi is likely smaller than Guntersville Lake based on relative
        prominence. Since the NO answer is based on an implied difference in size
        (not equality), this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about Lake Kizi's size. Since
        it provides a clear comparative conclusion of "NO" (rather than saying it
        cannot determine), this should be classified as NO.

        model never claimed the lakes were equal in size - it simply lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison
        due to limited information about Lake Kizi. While it "leans towards NO," this
        is not a clear NO answer, and the model explicitly states "it's not possible
        to definitively answer the question." This uncertainty about making the comparison
        classifies as UNKNOWN.

        in area than the Madura Strait." The NO is given because of this difference
        in size, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is based on a size difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Windigo does
        not have a larger area than Lake Phalen" as its final conclusion. This is
        a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lakes have equal areas. The model explicitly states that Lake Phalen has
        a "significantly larger area than Lake Windigo" and describes Lake Windigo
        as "relatively small" while Lake Phalen is "one of the largest lakes in Saint
        Paul." The NO answer was based on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that Lake Phalen has a larger area than Lake Windigo. This
        is a clear NO answer to the question of whether Lake Windigo has a larger
        area than Lake Phalen.

        in size. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Lake Phalen is larger
        than Lake Windigo, describing Lake Windigo as "relatively small" and Lake
        Phalen as "larger than many small lakes."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Windigo does
        not have a larger area than Lake Phalen" as its final comparative conclusion.

        measurements, it does not state that the lakes are equal in size. Instead,
        it suggests that Upvan Lake is "unlikely to be significantly larger" than
        Jellyfish Lake, implying there may be some difference in size. The NO answer
        is based on comparative reasoning rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Upvan Lake has a larger area than Jellyfish Lake. While
        the model expresses some uncertainty about Upvan Lake's exact size, it still
        provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to compare or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        in size. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Macquarie is much larger
        than Kakagi Lake" and provides specific size information for Lake Macquarie
        (110 square kilometers) while noting Kakagi Lake is "relatively small." The
        NO answer is based on a size difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Kakagi Lake does not have a larger area than Lake
        Macquarie. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are equal
        in size. Instead, it explicitly states that Kakagi Lake is "significantly
        smaller" and "much smaller in area compared to Lake Macquarie." The NO answer
        is based on this size difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Kakagi Lake does not have a larger area than Lake
        Macquarie." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lakes are equal in
        size. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Lake Macquarie is significantly
        larger than Kakagi Lake" - indicating a difference in values, not equality.
        The NO answer was based on this size difference, not on the lakes being the
        same size.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Kakagi Lake has a larger area than Lake Macquarie.
        The model made a clear determination and provided its reasoning.

        in size. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Lake Macquarie is "much larger
        in area compared to Kakagi Lake." The NO answer is based on a difference in
        size (with Lake Macquarie being larger), not on the lakes being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, specifically saying "NO, Kakagi Lake does not have a larger
        area than Lake Macquarie." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes have equal
        or same areas. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that Lake Macquarie
        is large and well-documented while Kakagi Lake is not widely recognized as
        being particularly large. The NO answer is based on an implied difference
        in size, not equality.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Macquarie (110 sq km) is
        larger than Kakagi Lake (65 sq km). The NO answer is based on this size difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
