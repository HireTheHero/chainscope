      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated that the areas are different,
        with Avalanche Lake being "much smaller than" Lake Kashiba. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas and finding that Avalanche Lake (0.1134 sq km) is
        much smaller than Lake Kashiba (370 sq km)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were different (20 acres
        vs 9880 acres) and indicated that Avalanche Lake is smaller than Lake Kashiba.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the areas of the two lakes, providing a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly calculated different values (28
        acres vs 37.54 acres) and stated that "Avalanche Lake is smaller than Lake
        Kashiba." The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through the comparison steps
        and concluded with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The answer
        was definitive and based on the calculated difference in sizes (28 acres vs
        37.54 acres).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the guidelines. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the areas were equal - it stated that one area couldn't be measured
        for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explains that a comparison
        is not possible because one is a bay without a standard area measurement.
        Since the model rejects the ability to make the comparison, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN category per the guidelines.

        the values were equal - it stated that one value couldn't even be determined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        the question cannot be answered because one of the areas cannot be meaningfully
        defined. This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question, making
        it an UNKNOWN rather than a clear NO comparative result.

        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make the comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the question cannot be
        answered with a simple YES or NO" and explains that a comparison is not possible
        because one entity (Coral Bay) doesn't have a comparable area measurement.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it shows
        that the values are different (20 sq miles vs 23.16 sq miles). The model does
        not state that the values are equal or the same, and in fact explicitly shows
        they are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas of the two lakes (20 sq miles vs 23.16 sq miles)

        that the areas are different (51.8 sq km vs 60 sq km) and indicates that one
        is "less than" the other. The NO is not based on the values being equal, but
        rather on there being a clear difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the areas of the two lakes, where it found that
        East Grand Lake (51.8 sq km) is less than Lake Sibhayi (60 sq km).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (15 vs 10.1 square miles)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas of the two lakes

    4983da27-c0b8-4738-a87e-1a7024d1c47d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the values are close (15 sq miles vs 15.4 sq
        miles), the model explicitly shows that they are different with the inequality
        "15 square miles (Gull Lake) < 15.4 square miles (Dipor Bil)" and does not
        state they are equal or the same. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in Step 4, and this is given as a direct comparative result after calculating
        and comparing the areas of both lakes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (10,000 vs
        9,880 acres)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the sizes of Gull Lake and Dipor Bil, finding Gull Lake to be larger (10,000
        acres vs 9,880 acres)
      final_answer: 'YES'

    71e4d038-5e30-4302-8e09-de4543fe1897:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the values are close (38.85 vs 40 sq km), the
        model explicitly states they are different, with Gull Lake being "smaller
        than" Dipor Bil. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the areas, where it found that Gull Lake (38.85
        sq km) is smaller than Dipor Bil (40 sq km)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c7180eed-ed81-4f18-a764-6ee1d274820a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the values are close (15 vs 15.4 square miles),
        the model shows they are not exactly equal, with Dipor Bil being slightly
        larger. The model notes this difference in the comparison step, so this is
        not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the areas of the two lakes, making this a clear NO answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cc60aded-bcb9-45bb-b499-5f79cfcc3751:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both lakes appear
        to have similar surface areas, around 15.4 square miles" and uses this equality
        as the primary reason for its NO answer ("Therefore, Gull Lake does not have
        a larger area").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer when comparing if Gull Lake has a larger area than Dipor Bil.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the areas were equal - it actually suggested different measurement approaches
        would yield different results.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is inconsistent and unclear -
        it first says "NO" but then immediately contradicts itself by saying "YES"
        when considering a specific interpretation. This makes the final comparative
        answer ambiguous. Additionally, it questions the validity of the comparison
        itself due to the nature of measuring bay areas.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed that the lakes have different
        sizes (251 acres vs 496 acres) and used the < symbol to indicate Lake Windigo
        is smaller than Lake Phalen
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lakes were equal in size.
        Instead, it explicitly noted that Lake Windigo is "considerably smaller" than
        Lake Phalen (272 acres), indicating a clear difference in size rather than
        equality.

    6209e065-78ac-45c1-8dab-d7cbcc30bab3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values (250 acres vs 490
        acres) and shows they are unequal using "<" symbol. The NO is based on finding
        a difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the surface areas and finding Lake Windigo (250 acres)
        is smaller than Lake Phalen (490 acres)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the lakes are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states "Lake Phalen is definitely larger." The NO answer
        appears to be based on a size difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lakes, making this a clear NO response.

        in size between the lakes ("Lake Windigo is significantly smaller than Lake
        Phalen") and provides specific different values (27 acres vs 430 acres). The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Lake Phalen is larger" and describes
        Lake Windigo as "relatively small" while Lake Phalen is "considerably larger."
        The NO answer appears to be given despite this difference, not because of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lakes, making this a clear NO response.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that one area (6000 ha)
        was less than the other (8000 ha), showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows its steps and concludes
        with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, finding that Pallikaranai

        wetland could be 80 sq km (same as Chiemsee), this is not given as the reason
        for the NO answer. Instead, the model bases its NO on the fact that 60 sq
        km (and even the upper estimate of 80 sq km) is less than 80 sq km, indicating
        a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (592 vs 589.6).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows its steps and concludes
        with an explicit "YES" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    be92f34b-3ea7-469f-aabf-fe630e80d3b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (592 vs 589.6) rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the surface areas of the two lakes and determining that 592
        > 589.6.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (592 vs 589.6) rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the areas and finding Lake Balaton (592 sq km) to be larger than Lake Izabal
        (589.6 sq km)

    1cad83cb-3eff-433d-b796-f0f8a4a7a77a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lakes were equal in size.
        Instead, it explicitly indicated a difference, stating that Paruthipattu Lake
        is "significant" while Lake Kai Iwi appears to be "much smaller." The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after going through its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the areas of the two lakes, making this a clear YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9c5ebcd1-d006-4e41-9340-de2cdf587890:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lakes were equal in size.
        Instead, it indicated that one lake (Paruthipattu) is larger than the other
        (Lake Kai Iwi), describing the latter as "significantly smaller." The NO answer
        was based on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without caveats about inability to verify or rejecting
        premises. While it noted some uncertainty about one lake's size, it still
        made a definitive comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (5.74 sq km vs 0.405 sq km)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the areas of the two lakes, showing Lake Kaiiwi (5.74 sq km) is larger than
        Paruthipattu Lake (0.405 sq km)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and explains that it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of reliable data. This is a clear refusal to make a comparative judgment.
      final_answer: REFUSED
