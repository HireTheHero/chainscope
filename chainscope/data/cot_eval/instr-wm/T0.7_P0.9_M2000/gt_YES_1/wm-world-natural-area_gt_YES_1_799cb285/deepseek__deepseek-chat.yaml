        (4.5 vs 7.5 square miles), it explicitly states they are different, with Diamond
        Valley Lake being smaller than Lake Orta. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas and explicitly concludes that "Diamond Valley Lake
        does not have a larger area than Lake Orta."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Diamond Valley Lake
        (4.5 square miles) is smaller than Lake Orta (7.5 square miles). The values
        are different, and the NO answer is based on one being smaller than the other,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, directly addressing the comparative question of whether Diamond
        Valley Lake has a larger area than Lake Orta. The answer is definitive and
        includes specific measurements showing Diamond Valley Lake (4.5 sq mi) is
        smaller than Lake Orta (7.5 sq mi).

        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Lac Vieux Desert (4,260 acres) is smaller
        than Wahwashkesh Lake (7,900 acres)" and gives different values for each lake.
        The NO answer is based on one being smaller than the other, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Lac Vieux Desert does not have a larger area
        than Wahwashkesh Lake. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Chip Lake
        is significantly larger in area" and shows the difference (Pemadumcook ~8,000
        acres vs Chip Lake ~19,027 acres). The NO is based on a clear difference in
        values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that the Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes does not have
        a larger area than Chip Lake (Alberta). The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the areas are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that "Chip Lake is significantly larger in area
        than the Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes" and provides different values (36.4 vs
        77 square kilometers). The NO answer is based on one being larger than the
        other, not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
