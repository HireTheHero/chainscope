        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with La Salle being "slightly south" of Robert Morris. The model
        explains that Robert Morris (401 S. State Street) was closer to Madison Street
        than La Salle (417 S. Dearborn Street), making Robert Morris further north
        than La Salle.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Robert Morris University
        Illinois was "further north" and "closer to Madison Street" than La Salle
        Extension University, indicating a difference in their locations. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, La Salle Extension University
        was not located north of Robert Morris University Illinois" as its final answer.

        that Robert Morris University is more north than La Salle Extension University.
        The model explains that Robert Morris (401 S. State Street) has a smaller
        address number than La Salle (417 S. Dearborn Street), making it closer to
        Madison Street and therefore more north. The model does not state that the

        (417 S. Dearborn Street) is south of Robert Morris University Illinois (401
        S. State Street) because in Chicago's street numbering system, the address
        with the smaller number (401) is closer to Madison Street and therefore further
        north than the address with the larger number (417). The model clearly identifies
        a difference in the north-south positions of the two universities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that La Salle Extension
        University is not located north of Robert Morris University Illinois, but

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison showing
        that Robert Morris was further north than La Salle (not that they were at
        the same location). The model specifically states that Robert Morris (401
        S.) was closer to Madison Street than La Salle (417 S.), indicating a difference
        in their north-south positions. The model does not claim the values are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        The model concludes that "Robert Morris University Illinois (401 S.) was closer
        to Madison Street than La Salle Extension University (417 S.), Robert Morris
        was located further north." This is a direct answer to the question of whether
        La Salle is north of Robert Morris.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Robert Morris University was
        farther north than La Salle Extension University. The model concludes that
        "Since 401 is a smaller number than 417 (or 4101), Robert Morris University
        was located farther north than La Salle Extension University." This indicates
        a difference in values (locations), not equality.

        Extension University was "further south" than Robert Morris University Illinois,
        noting that "417 is higher than 401, which means La Salle was further south
        than Robert Morris." The model identifies a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative

        Extension University was "further south" than Robert Morris University Illinois,
        indicating a difference in their locations. The model determined that 417
        South Dearborn is further south than 401 South State based on Chicago's address
        system.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that La Salle Extension University
        was not located north of Robert Morris University Illinois, but was instead
        located further south.

        University (417 S. Dearborn) was "further south" and "positioned slightly
        further south" than Robert Morris University Illinois (401 S. State). The
        model's NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the question "Is La

        is that one of the entities (Washington Technology University) does not exist,
        making the comparison impossible. The model does not state that the locations
        have the same latitude or are otherwise equal in value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" as stated
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "Washington Technology
        University does not exist as an actual accredited institution in Washington
        state, so Antioch University Seattle cannot be located north of it." This

        relationship not meaningful. The model argues that it's like asking if "a
        room is north of the building it's in" - which is a categorical relationship

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the Askew School is a component/subunit of the College, using the analogy
        "It would be like asking if a room is north of the building containing it."
        The reason for the NO is based on organizational structure (one being part
        of the other), not equality of location values.

        and floor. The model states "they effectively share the same geographical
        coordinates" and "they are located in the same building." The equality of

        that both institutions are located in the same building (the Bellamy Building)
        and share the same physical location. The model explicitly states "Since they
        share the same physical location and the Askew School is organizationally
        part of the College of Social Sciences, it cannot be considered north of it."
        This indicates the model is saying they have equal/identical locations as
        the primary reason for its NO answer.

        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is
        because the Askew School is a component of the College of Social Sciences
        and they share the same campus location. The model is not claiming the locations
        are identical, but rather that the organizational relationship makes the comparison
        inappropriate. This is a different reason than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Askew School is a component
        or part of the FSU College of Social Sciences and Public Policy, which is
        a hierarchical relationship rather than equality. The model states "it cannot
        be accurately described as being north of its parent organization" because
        of this organizational structure, not because they have equal geographic coordinates.

        within the College of Social Sciences and Public Policy, and they share the
        same physical location (Bellamy Building). The model's reasoning is based
        on organizational structure and co-location rather than equality of values.
        The model states "they are not in separate locations with a meaningful north/south
        relationship" which indicates the comparison doesn't apply due to their relationship,
        not because the values are equal.

        the Askew School is a part of the College of Social Sciences, not that they
        are equal or the same in value. The model argues that "a part cannot be directionally
        related to the whole that contains it" - this is a logical/structural relationship
        argument, not an equality argument. The model never states that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that the Askew School cannot be north of the College of
        Social Sciences because it is a department within the College itself. The
        model provides a definitive comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer
        is because Kate Gleason College of Engineering is a component of RIT ("a college
        that is part of RIT"), describing a containment relationship rather than equality.
        The model explains this is "a relationship of containment, not directional
        positioning."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Rochester Institute
        of Technology cannot be north of Kate Gleason College of Engineering" as its
        final answer. This is a clear negative comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Kate Gleason College of Engineering is a part of RIT, not a separate geographic
        location. The model argues that it's incorrect to say the entire institution
        is north of one of its component colleges. This is a relationship explanation
        (part-whole), not an equality statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Kate Gleason College of Engineering
        is a component of RIT and exists within the RIT campus. The reason for the
        NO answer is that one entity is part of the other, not that they have equal
        geographical coordinates. The model explains it's "like asking if a house
        is north of one of its own rooms" - indicating a relationship issue rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Rochester Institute
        of Technology is not located north of Kate Gleason College of Engineering
        because the latter is part of RIT itself." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is invalid
        because Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part of RIT, making it impossible
        for RIT to be north of something contained within it. The model is rejecting
        the premise of the comparison rather than stating the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Rochester Institute
        of Technology cannot be north of Kate Gleason College of Engineering because
        the engineering college is part of RIT itself and located on RIT's campus."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that the NO answer is because Kate
        Gleason College of Engineering is a part of Rochester Institute of Technology,
        and they share the same location. The model states "they're part of the same
        institution at the same location" and "they share the same campus location."
        This indicates the values being compared (their locations) are the same, and
        this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "# Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that Kate Gleason College of Engineering
        is part of Rochester Institute of Technology, and they share the same campus
        location. The model states "they share the same geographical location, with
        the college being a component of the university." The NO answer is based on
        the fact that the two entities occupy the same location (are equal in location),
        making it impossible for one to be north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Rochester Institute of Technology is not located
        north of Kate Gleason College of Engineering. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is invalid

        location. The model states "it wouldn't be accurate to say that RIT as a whole
        is north of one of its own colleges" because one contains the other, not because
        they have equal geographic coordinates.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is invalid
        because Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part of RIT (a containment
        relationship), not because they are at the same location. The model states
        "RIT as a whole cannot be strictly north of the college - the college is contained
        within RIT's boundaries." This indicates a relationship issue rather than
        equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on a probabilistic
        assessment that Sonnencroft is likely south of Indiana State University because
        "most of West Virginia is located south of Indiana State University's latitude."
        The model is making a directional comparison, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. The model rejected the premise
        of the question by stating Sonnencroft doesn't exist, rather than saying the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Sonnencroft, WV is not located north of Indiana
        State University because Sonnencroft doesn't exist as a real place in West
        Virginia." This is a clear NO answer that rejects the premise of the question
        by stating one of the locations doesn't exist.

        the majority of West Virginia lies south of Indiana State University's latitude.
        The model is making a comparative judgment about relative positions (north/south),
        not stating that the locations have the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provides a clear "NO" answer in its final
        conclusion. The model states "Answer: NO" and explains that "Based on geographic

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, the model's reasoning is that Sonnencroft
        doesn't exist or cannot be located in West Virginia, and therefore it cannot
        be positioned north of Indiana State University. The model is not claiming
        the locations have the same latitude or are otherwise equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Sonnencroft, WV is not located north of Indiana State

        "Most of West Virginia lies at similar latitudes to or south of Terre Haute"
        and that only the northern panhandle might be north of Indiana State University.
        The model indicates there's a difference in location, not that they're at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is a part of
        Temple University (one is contained within the other), which is a different
        relationship than equality. The model is saying that Boyer College cannot
        be north of Temple University because it is a constituent part of Temple University,
        not because they are at the same geographical coordinates.

        College of Music and Dance is not a separate geographic entity from Temple
        University but rather a part of it. The model explains they "share the same
        physical location, as one is a constituent part of the other." This is not
        stating that the values being compared are equal/identical/the same, but rather
        that the comparison itself is invalid because one entity is contained within

        not a separate location that could be positioned relative to Temple University.
        The model is rejecting the premise that these are two separate locations that

        University and they "share the same geographical location." This indicates
        the model is saying the values (locations) are the same, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer. The model states "it cannot be north
        of Temple University as a whole - they share the same geographical location"
        which clearly establishes equality as the reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Rather, it's based on the premise that the College of Liberal Arts
        is a division within Texas A&M University, not a separate location. The model
        explains they aren't two distinct places where one could be north of the other,
        not that they're at the same coordinates or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explains that Texas A&M University is not located north of Texas
        A&M College of Liberal Arts because they aren't two separate geographic locations
        - the College of Liberal Arts is a division within Texas A&M University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is not that
        the values being compared are equal. Rather, the model explains that the College
        of Liberal Arts is a component part of Texas A&M University, not a separate
        geographical entity. The model argues that it doesn't make geographical sense
        to compare the university with one of its own divisions in terms of cardinal
        directions, similar to asking if "the United States is north of Texas." The
        model is not claiming the locations are identical or equal, but that the comparison
        itself is flawed because one entity contains the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. The model clearly concludes that Texas A&M University is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is not that the values
        being compared are equal. Rather, the model explains that the comparison doesn't
        make geographical sense because the College of Liberal Arts is a component/part
        of Texas A&M University, not a separate geographical location. The model compares
        this to asking if "the United States is north of Texas." This is a rejection
        of the comparison's validity, not a statement that the locations are equal
        or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that the College
        of Liberal Arts is a part of Texas A&M University, not a separate location.
        The model explains they share the same location because one is a component
        of the other. The model states "they share the same location" which indicates
        the values being compared (their locations) are the same, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer. The model uses the analogy "it would
        be like asking if a house is north of one of its rooms" to emphasize they
        are the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        College of Liberal Arts is part of Texas A&M University and they share the

        they cannot be compared directionally because one is a component of the other,

        campus), and this equality in location is the primary reason given for the
