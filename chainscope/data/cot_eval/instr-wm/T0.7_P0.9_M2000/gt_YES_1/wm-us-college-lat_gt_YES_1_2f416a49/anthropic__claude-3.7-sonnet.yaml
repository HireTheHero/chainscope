      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference by
        stating "Fergus Falls, MN is slightly north of Wahpeton, ND" and "with Fergus
        Falls being slightly north, but not significantly so." Since the model acknowledges
        a directional difference (even if described as slight), this does not qualify
        as claiming the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that "The answer
        is NO. Minnesota State Community and Technical College in Fergus Falls is
        not north of North Dakota State College of Science in Wahpeton."

        \ for both locations and describes them as being at \"essentially the same\
        \ latitude,\" making equality of position the primary reason for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Minnesota State
        Community and Technical College (Fergus Falls) is slightly north of North
        Dakota State College of Science (Wahpeton)." This indicates a difference in
        position (one being slightly north of the other), not equality. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has provided a step-by-step analysis and concluded with a definitive
        "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values - in fact, it ultimately concluded
        there was a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer after double-checking the
        geographical positions. The final conclusion was that "Minnesota State Community
        and Technical College is slightly north of North Dakota State College of Science."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded the locations
        were slightly different (with M State being slightly north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer after double-checking.
        The final determination was that "Minnesota State Community and Technical
        College is slightly north of North Dakota State College of Science."

    d73d5a55-551b-42f6-a2c5-e4558b0cf680:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "most M State campuses
        are not significantly north of North Dakota State College of Science. They
        are primarily east of it, at similar latitudes." The model notes that the
        campuses are at "similar latitudes" with "some slightly north and some slightly
        south," indicating small differences rather than equality. The primary reason
        for the NO is that the colleges are primarily east-west of each other rather
        than in a north-south relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d834b194-9a50-4954-9f95-a687236384f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. Instead, it says "They are at approximately the same latitude, with
        M State's campuses being either at similar latitudes or slightly north, but
        the difference is not significant enough to say one is definitively north
        of the other." This indicates there is a slight difference (with M State being
        "slightly north"), but the model considers this difference too small to warrant
        a YES answer. Since the model notes a difference, even if described as not
        significant, this does not qualify as stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Minnesota State Community
        and Technical College is not north of North Dakota State College of Science."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e7478e49-c3cd-4262-9910-cf6209f2fc1f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. Instead, it notes that "Fergus Falls is slightly north of Wahpeton"
        and they are "at nearly identical latitudes" but not exactly the same. Since
        the model acknowledges a slight difference (even if tiny), this does not qualify
        as stating the values are equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that Minnesota State
        Community and Technical College is not north of North Dakota State College
        of Science.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        \ very slightly north of Wahpeton.\" Since the model identifies a difference\
        \ (even if described as \"very slightly\"), this is not a case where the NO\
        \ answer is based on equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        indicating that PennWest Clarion is located north of University of Bridgeport.

        CT (by a fraction of a degree)" and "with Clarion possibly being very slightly
        north, but the difference is minimal." Since the model acknowledges a slight
        difference rather than exact equality, this does not qualify as equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - PennWest Clarion,
        PA is not definitively located north of University of Bridgeport, CT." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        Professions Campus is "slightly south and west of downtown Portland where
        PSU is located" and would be "southwest of Portland State University, not
        north of it." The model is indicating a directional difference (southwest
        vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that Pacific University Health Professions

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it acknowledges there "may be a slight northward
        component" but argues the primary directional relationship is westward. Since
        it notes a difference (even if described as "slight"), this does not qualify
        as claiming the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer paragraph, indicating that Pacific University Health Professions
        Campus is not north of Portland State University. This is a clear negative
        comparative result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Pacific University Health
        Professions Campus is "slightly northwest of Portland State University, but
        primarily west" and that while it "has a slight northward component relative
        to PSU, it is predominantly west, not north." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.

        Health Professions Campus is marginally north of Portland State University"
        and "Pacific University's Hillsboro campus is slightly northwest of Portland
        State University." The model notes a difference in position, even if described
        as "marginally" or "slightly," which means it's not claiming equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.

        argues that the primary directional difference is west, not north. Since it
        notes a difference in north-south positioning (even if described as "minimal"
        and "slightly"), this is not a case where the values are the same.

        Campus is "primarily west" and "slightly northwest" of Portland State University,
        indicating a directional difference rather than equality. The NO answer is
        based on the primary direction being west rather than north, not on the locations
        being identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Pacific University
        Health Professions Campus is primarily west of Portland State University,

        is a slight difference in the north-south positioning. The model's NO answer
        is based on the fact that the primary directional relationship is west, not
        north, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        "similar or slightly lower" indicates a difference, not equality. The model
        is saying California Pacific School of Theology is likely at a lower latitude
        (more south) than Francis Marion University, not that they're at the same
        latitude.

        north" indicates a small difference rather than equality, even if the difference
        is described as minimal. Since the model notes this slight difference rather
        than stating they are exactly the same, this does not qualify as equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.

        of Atlanta University Center. The model's reasoning indicates a clear directional
        difference, not equality, even though its final "NO" contradicts this reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This directly contradicts its reasoning in Step 3 where it concluded
        "Laurus Technical Institute is indeed north of Atlanta University Center."

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values - in fact, it ultimately concluded
        the locations were different (one slightly north of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer after double-checking the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer and explains that the
        universities are "at approximately the same latitude" as the reason. It does
        note that Mount Union might be "very slightly north of one FDU campus," but
        the primary reason for the NO is that they are described as being "at approximately

        latitude" as the reason for its NO answer, but then adds "with Mount Union
        being only very slightly north of one FDU campus." Since the model notes a
        difference in values (even if described as "very slightly"), this does not
        qualify as stating the values are exactly equal. The model is indicating a
        small directional difference exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,

        "University of Mount Union is not definitively north of Fairleigh Dickinson
        University, as they are at approximately the same latitude." The equality
        of latitudes is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        indicating that "University of Mount Union is not definitively north of Fairleigh

        the same latitude" as the reason for its NO answer. The equality of the latitudes
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its response.
        In its final answer, it clarifies "NO - University of Mount Union is not definitively
        north of Fairleigh Dickinson University, as they are at approximately the

        equal. Instead, it says they are "extremely close" and "at approximately the
        same latitude, with Mount Union being either at the same latitude or only
        marginally further north." The model indicates there might be a slight difference
        with Mount Union "possibly being slightly further north" or "marginally further
        north." Since it acknowledges a potential small difference rather than stating
        they are exactly equal, this doesn't qualify as claiming the values are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer, indicating that University of Mount Union is not definitively

        It says they are "at essentially the same latitude" and "approximately at
        the same latitude". While it mentions Mount Union being "possibly slightly
        further north" than one campus, its primary reasoning for the NO answer is
        that they are approximately at the same latitude, indicating equality as the
        basis for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Wittenberg University is slightly south of Cheyney University" in
        its parenthetical explanation for the NO answer. Although it mentions they
        are at "very similar latitudes" and "the difference is very small," it clearly
        indicates a directional difference (south vs. north) rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, there's a contradiction in the response. In Step 3, the model claims
        "Wittenberg University is slightly north of Cheyney University" but then gives
        "NO" as the answer to whether Wittenberg is north of Cheyney. The model then
        adds a parenthetical note contradicting its earlier reasoning, saying Wittenberg
        is actually "slightly south" of Cheyney. Despite this contradiction, the model's
        explicit final answer was "NO".

        is "slightly south"), which means it's not claiming the values are the same.
        Even though the difference is described as minimal, any directional difference
        means the values are not considered equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different locations within Richmond (University of Richmond in the
        west/southwest area and Virginia Union University in the north/central area).
        The model concludes that University of Richmond is south of Virginia Union
        University, not north of it, indicating a clear directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "University of Richmond
        is generally south of Virginia Union University, not north of it" and ends

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in positions,
        stating that "University of Richmond is in the western part of Richmond, not
        particularly north" while "Virginia Union University is specifically in the
        northern part of Richmond." The model concludes that University of Richmond
        is "located west and somewhat south of Virginia Union University." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "University

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "University of Richmond is west and
        slightly south of Virginia Union University" and "Since University of Richmond
        is south of Virginia Union University (not north), the answer is NO." The
        model is identifying a directional difference (south vs. north) as the reason
        for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in step 6 of its reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end. The
        model is making a clear comparative judgment that University of Richmond is
        not north of Virginia Union University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "Hartford is
        slightly further north than Cranston" and concludes that "Saint Paul School
        in Cranston would be south of Hartford International University." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and definitive at the end
        of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Askew School is a department
        within the College of Social Sciences, and therefore "cannot be north of the
        entire college, as it is contained within the organizational structure of
        the college." The reason for the NO is based on organizational structure (containment),
        not equal geographical positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Askew School is "a part of" the College of Social Sciences, implying
        a hierarchical relationship rather than equality. The model explains they
        have an organizational relationship where one is a subdivision of the other,
        not that they are in the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The Askew School
        of Public Administration and Policy is not located north of the FSU College
        of Social Sciences, but is rather a part of it." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Askew School is actually
        contained within the College of Social Sciences ("the Askew School is a department
        within the College of Social Sciences"), which is a different relationship
        than equality. The reason for the NO is that one entity is contained within
        the other, not that they have equal geographic coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Askew School
        of Public Administration and Policy is not located north of Florida State
        University College of Social Sciences" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it explains that the Askew School
        is "a part of the FSU College of Social Sciences and Public Policy, making
        them essentially co-located." The model is saying they are not separate entities
        with distinct locations, rather than stating they have identical coordinates.
        The term "essentially co-located" suggests a relationship rather than exact
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer, indicating that the Askew School of Public Administration
        and Policy is not located north of Florida State University College of Social
        Sciences.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Askew School is a part
        of the FSU College of Social Sciences, making them not separate geographical
        entities that can be compared directionally. The reason for the NO is not
        that they have equal coordinates or are in the exact same location, but rather
        that one is a component of the other, making the comparison inappropriate.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The Askew School
        of Public Administration and Policy is not located north of Florida State
        University College of Social Sciences" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that the
        Askew School and the College of Social Sciences are in the same location -
        "they are essentially in the same location on FSU's campus" and "they are
        in the same building/campus area." The model explicitly states they cannot
        be meaningfully described as north of the other because they are in the same
        location, indicating equality of position is the primary reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that one location is not north of
        the other.

        rather than equality. The reason for the NO is that one entity is contained
        within the other, not that they have equal geographical positions.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer and explains that
        the reason is because the Askew School is actually a department within the
        College of Social Sciences and Public Policy at FSU. The model states they
        are "essentially in the same location on campus" and "essentially co-located."
        This indicates the model is saying NO because the entities are in the same
        location/equal in position, not because one is in a different direction than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that the Askew School
        is not located north of the FSU College of Social Sciences.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - that the Askew School is a department within the College of
        Social Sciences, and therefore "cannot be north of the entire college that
        contains it." This is a hierarchical/containment relationship reason, not
        an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that the Askew School cannot
        be north of the College of Social Sciences because it is a department within
        that college.

        is part of RIT and located on the RIT campus. The model's reasoning is that
        one entity contains the other, not that they have identical coordinates. The
        model states "the college exists within the geographical boundaries of RIT"

        However, the model also indicates that "Sonnencroft is not a recognized town
        or city in West Virginia" and "Sonnencroft, WV does not appear to be a real
        location," which means it's rejecting a premise of the question. The model
        cannot make a valid comparison because one of the locations doesn't exist

        In fact, it explicitly states "Jamestown is actually slightly south of Dickinson
        by a small margin." Even though it notes they are at "very similar latitudes"
        and "nearly the same latitude," it clearly indicates a directional difference
        (slightly south), which means they are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, University of Jamestown

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" because it lacks complete information about Kingston University
        LA's precise location. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison without
        more specific location data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Charles R. Drew University
        is likely south of Kingston University LA since it's "quite far south in the
        Los Angeles area" and "Most institutions in Los Angeles proper would be north
        of it." The model is indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Charles R. Drew University
        is not north of Kingston University LA, based on its reasoning about the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but this is contradicted by its earlier statement that "I cannot
        provide a reliable YES or NO answer." The model indicates it lacks sufficient
        information to make the comparison, saying "Without having the exact address
        for Kingston University LA, I cannot make a definitive north-south comparison."
        This indicates the model cannot determine the answer rather than providing
        a definitive comparative result.

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Charles R. Drew University is north of Kingston University LA)". This
        indicates the model cannot determine the comparison due to insufficient information
        about Kingston University LA's specific location. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model is stating it cannot make the determination.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Charles R. Drew
        University is located south of Kingston University LA, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Charles R. Drew University
        of Medicine and Science is not located north of Kingston University LA. It
        is located south of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that Charles R. Drew University is north of Kingston University LA based on
        available information)". This indicates the model cannot determine the comparison
        due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category. The model
        explicitly states it "cannot confidently determine" and "cannot confirm" the
        relative positions.

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities are in different
        locations, with Charles R. Drew University being in South Los Angeles and
        Kingston University LA being in the Koreatown/Mid-Wilshire area, which is
        north of South Los Angeles. The model's NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (south vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Charles R. Drew University is located north of
        Kingston University LA. The model concludes that "Charles R. Drew University
        is located SOUTH of Kingston University LA, not north of it" and then gives
        a clear "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Southwest Recreation
        Center is south and west of the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex" and
        "It is actually south of it." The model is giving NO because it believes one
        location is south of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Southwest Recreation Center is north of the Cancer and Genetics
        Research Complex. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (locations)
        being compared are the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that the Southwest
        Recreation Center is located north of the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex,
        indicating they are at different locations. The NO answer contradicts the
        model's own reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the locations are equal or
        identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This directly contradicts its own reasoning, as
        the model concluded "the Southwest Recreation Center is indeed located north
        of the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex" but then gave "NO" as its final
        answer. Despite this contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit
        final answer provided.

        a clear directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (south vs. north), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Southwest Recreation Center is north of the
        Cancer and Genetics Research Complex. The model explicitly concludes with
        "NO" after reasoning that since the Southwest Recreation Center is south of
        the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex, it cannot be north of it.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "University of Louisiana
        at Lafayette is NOT north of McNeese State University" and ends with a clear
        "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in the latitudes, stating "They
        are very close, but Lake Charles is slightly north of Lafayette" and "University
        of Louisiana at Lafayette is slightly south of McNeese State University."
        The model's NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating that "Lafayette
        is very slightly south of Lake Charles (by a tiny margin)". Even though the
        difference is described as "tiny," the model is clearly indicating a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "University
        of Louisiana at Lafayette is located slightly south of McNeese State University,
        not north of it" and therefore answers "NO".

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, University of Louisiana
