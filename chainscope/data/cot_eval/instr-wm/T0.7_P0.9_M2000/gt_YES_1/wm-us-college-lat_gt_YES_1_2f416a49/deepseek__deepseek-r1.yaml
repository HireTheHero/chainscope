      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes the difference is \"minimal\"\
        \ and \"slight,\" it explicitly states there is a difference in latitude (27.9470\xB0\
        \ vs 27.9477\xB0) and that one location is south of the other. The NO answer\
        \ is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear "NO" answer, explaining that The University of Tampa
        is slightly south of Schiller International University based on their coordinates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because\
        \ the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference\
        \ in latitude (27.9465\xB0N vs 28.0197\xB0N) and concluded that Schiller is\
        \ north of Tampa. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that The University of Tampa is south of Schiller
        International University, providing specific latitude coordinates to support
        this conclusion.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        It spends the entire response trying to determine the locations of both universities,
        expressing uncertainty about where Schiller International University is located
        (Tampa? Largo? Dunedin? Orlando?), and ends mid-thought with "Wait". No final
        comparative answer is provided.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Pacific University's Health Professions Campus is west of PSU, indicating
        a different relative position. The NO is based on directional difference (west
        vs north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a specific directional explanation (west instead
        of north) for why the comparison does not hold. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

        that "Pratt Institute is north of NYU Tandon" - indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The NO answer was given because Pratt is north of NYU Tandon, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that NYU Tandon is not north

        - that NYU Tandon is south of Pratt Institute, with Pratt being north of NYU
        Tandon. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        because the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the locations are different, with Tandon being south of Pratt ("NYU Tandon
        is south of Pratt Institute"). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result that NYU Tandon is
        not north of Pratt Institute. The answer is supported by geographical reasoning

        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Clinton Hill
        (where Pratt is) lies northeast of Downtown Brooklyn (where NYU Tandon is),
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        was given because one location is specifically described as being north of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about the relative positions
        (stating that Pratt is north of NYU Tandon, therefore NYU Tandon is not north
        of Pratt).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes they are at the same location
        ("same campus"), this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        the model's reasoning is that the College of Sciences is a part/division of
        ASU and therefore "cannot be geographically north of itself." The sameness
        of location is presented as supporting evidence rather than the primary reason
        for the NO answer.

        within the university campus, making the comparison invalid, but doesn't claim
        they have identical locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/identical. Instead, it explains that the College of Sciences is
        a component within the university's campus, making a north comparison invalid
        because one is contained within the other. This is a different logical reason
        than equality.

        or very close" and concludes they are "in the same location." This equality
        of location is the main basis for the NO answer.

        The NO answer is based on the logical impossibility of a part being north
        of its whole, not because the locations are equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer about the geographical relationship, explaining that the

        because they have identical coordinates. The model discusses them being "co-located"
        and "part of" each other, but doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact
        same location as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and provided a clear comparative conclusion that Gardner-Webb is north of
        Sewanee, supported by specific latitude coordinates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference - the College of Agriculture is south of State
        Street while the Weldon School is north of State Street. The NO was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a specific directional explanation that the College
        of Agriculture is south of the Weldon School, not north.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the buildings are at
        the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that the College of Agriculture
        is south of the Engineering Mall (where Weldon is located), indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer based on its analysis
        of the relative locations of the two buildings.'

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" twice - once after
        its thinking process and again in its final explanation. The model was clear
        and direct in its comparative conclusion that the College of Agriculture is
        north of the Weldon School.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, stating that the
        College of Agriculture is north of the Weldon School.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (College of Agriculture is south while
        Weldon School is north), not because they are equal or the same. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a directional comparison explaining that the College
        of Agriculture is south of the Weldon School, not north of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        locations, with Agriculture in the southern part of campus and Engineering
        in the northern/central part. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including a final bolded "ANSWER: NO" at the end. This NO is given
        as a direct comparative answer about the relative positions of the two locations.'

    baf732a2-8d9b-432b-9168-03dae3fae81a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different locations
        - with the College of Agriculture in the southern part of campus (Lilly Hall)
        and the Weldon School in the northwestern area (Jischke Hall). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in the detailed explanation.
        It definitively concludes that the College of Agriculture is not north of
        the Weldon School, but rather south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that they are "in the same building"
        and "share the same location" as the primary reason for its NO answer. This
        equality in location is explicitly given as the reason why one cannot be north
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes they are "co-located" and
        in the "same general location", it does not explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same location or equal coordinates. Instead, it suggests they share the
        same campus area but could be in different buildings, just not with one being
        distinctly north of the other. The NO answer is based on lack of evidence
        for a northern position, not on proven equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations are "likely
        co-located or in proximate buildings" and are "part of the same institution,"
        it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location. Instead,
        it suggests they are close together and administratively linked, but doesn't
        use this as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model leaves open the
        possibility of different buildings in "proximate" locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and reinforces
        this with bold formatting ("**NO**"). The answer is clearly stated as a comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both entities are
        "housed within the same building" and "share the same geographic location"
        as the reason for its NO answer. This equality in location is the primary
        basis for concluding that neither is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that one is not north of the other. The answer is definitive
        and not qualified with uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "they share the same geographic
        location" and this equality of location is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any directional difference between the
        locations, instead emphasizing that they are in "the same geographic location"
        and "same university campus."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this as its comparative answer, explaining that one institution is
        not north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is explicitly based on the fact
        that both institutions are located in the same building (Bellamy Building),
        stating "Since they occupy the same building, neither is north of the other."
        The equality of location is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and "**Answer:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they share "the same location"
        and are in "the same building," this is presented as part of a larger explanation
        about them being part of the same administrative structure. The model doesn't
        explicitly state that equal location is the primary reason for the NO answer
        - rather, it presents this as part of a complex explanation about administrative
        structure and physical location. The response suggests they could even be
        in "adjacent buildings."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that the Askew School is not north of the College of
        Social Sciences.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is explicitly based on the fact
        that the two locations are exactly the same place - "they share the same campus
        and location" and "RIT is not north of itself." The equality of location is
        the primary reason given for the NO answer, with no mention of any directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear "NO" followed by an explanation that they are the same
        institution. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

        "identical" and "the same" multiple times ("share the same location", "their
        geographical locations are identical", "share the same campus and location"),
        and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model
        does not mention any directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final bolded answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that
        RIT is not north of the engineering college.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states NO because the two locations are
        exactly the same place - they are the same institution and "co-located." The
        model explicitly states "they are not geographically separate" and that they're
        "in the same place." This equality is the primary reason given for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that RIT

        and "share the same geographic location," and this equality is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer. The model does not indicate any directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        locations might be at "similar latitudes," it never actually reaches a NO
        conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a final YES/NO answer. While it attempts to analyze the latitudes of both
        locations, it never reaches a conclusion about which is further north.

        results in False for question 2. The criteria for True only apply when the
        final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's thought process was cut off mid-sentence,
        but the last clear statement about the answer was "So then the answer would
        be YES." After that, it started second-guessing but never reached a different
        conclusion. Since the last definitive answer given was YES, and no other conclusion
        was reached, we should classify this as YES.

        University share the same location ("shares the same geographic location"),
        this is not presented as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the
        primary reason given is that Boyer College is a part of Temple University
        and therefore cannot be north of itself. The sharing of location is presented
        as a consequence of being part of the same institution, not as the primary
        reasoning for the NO answer.

        and "share the same campus," this is not presented as meaning they are at
        exactly the same coordinates. Rather, the NO answer is given because Boyer
        College is "integrated within" Temple University as a part of the institution.
        The model suggests there could even be different buildings across the campus,
        but the comparison is invalid because one is part of the other.

        is part of Temple University, it does not base the NO answer on the two locations
        having equal coordinates or being at the same point. Rather, it explains that
        one cannot be north of the other because they are not separate entities -
        Boyer College is integrated into Temple's campus. This is a different reason
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        because they're part of the same campus, this is not presented as a case of
        equal coordinates being the primary reason for the NO answer. Rather, the
        NO is primarily because Boyer College is a part of Temple University, making
        the comparison invalid. The model emphasizes organizational relationship rather
        than spatial equality as the main reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, even if we had
        classified the final answer as NO, the model's reason was not that the values
        were equal - rather, it stated one location doesn't exist in Mesa, AZ.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains this is due to Wilkes University not existing in Mesa,
        AZ, it still provides NO as a definitive comparative answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine. Since the model rejects the premises
        but still gives NO as its final answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        per the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it gives two reasons for NO: 1) The premise is incorrect because
        Wilkes isn''t in Mesa, and 2) ASU''s campus is west of Mesa, not north. The
        model explicitly states directional differences ("west of Mesa, not north")
        rather than equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses doubt about the existence
        of Wilkes University in Mesa, its NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Tempe being west of Mesa), not because the locations are the same. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference, even considering multiple
        scenarios.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer. While it questions the premise about Wilkes
        University's location, it still provides a definitive NO based on the directional
        relationship (west, not north) between the locations.

        did discuss equal/unequal values at various points but never reached a final
        NO answer based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows significant uncertainty and contradicts
        itself multiple times. While it initially concludes "YES" based on latitude
        comparisons, it then switches to "NO" because Wilkes isn't in Mesa, then back
        to "YES" based on hypothetical location, and continues to vacillate without
        providing a clear final answer. The response ends mid-sentence without making
        a definitive conclusion.

        explicitly states this is the reason for the NO answer: "NO, because Wilkes
        University is not located in Mesa, AZ." This is different from saying the
        locations are at the same coordinates.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer, providing a clear comparative result.
        While it notes the premise is problematic due to Wilkes University not being

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but provides reasoning that one of the locations (Wilkes University in Mesa,
        AZ) doesn't exist. Since the model rejects the premises of the question by
        stating "Since Wilkes University does not exist in Mesa, AZ, the comparison
        is invalid," this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        of one location, not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with "Thus, the answer is NO" because Wilkes University doesn't
        exist in Mesa, AZ. Since this is rejecting the premises of the question (explicitly
        stating one location doesn't exist), this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        is in South LA and would likely be south of (not north of) any location in
        LA proper. The model explicitly describes a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional result, even while acknowledging

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through an extensive thought process
        but never actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it briefly mentions
        "therefore, the answer would be NO" at one point, it immediately questions
        this conclusion ("but if both in the same city, perhaps one is in a northern
