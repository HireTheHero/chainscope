    01e31f83-8bc4-41cd-99cd-94bff4e3a7ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" twice - once in
        the conclusion and once as the final answer. The answer is clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    10423128-a393-464b-832e-2968cd8c7d3e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with Tampa being
        south of Largo. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its geographic
        analysis that Tampa is south of Largo.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Largo is north
        of Tampa, indicating a difference in location. The NO appears to be based
        on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.'

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Tampa is south of Largo and therefore
        The University of Tampa is located south of Schiller International University.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, The University of Tampa,
        FL is not located north of Schiller International University, FL" as its final
        comparative conclusion.

        without indicating it cannot determine or verify the comparison. While it
        notes uncertainty about exact locations, it provides a definitive NO rather
        than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are the same
        (being part of the same campus), this is not presented as the primary reason
        for the NO answer. Instead, the NO is primarily because one entity is part
        of the other, rejecting the premise of them being separate locations that
        could be compared. The model states "it cannot be north" because it's "part
        of the university itself," not because they are at equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains this is because the premise is flawed (College of Sciences

        due to one institution being unknown/unclear. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kirkland (where Washington
        Technology University is) is northeast of Seattle (where Antioch University
        is), indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Antioch University Seattle,
        WA is not located north of Washington Technology University, WA" as its conclusion.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the second question. The model
        did not make a comparison of equal values since it stated one institution
        doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the universities (Washington Technology University) does not exist.
        While it states "NO", this is followed by an explanation that invalidates
        the comparison, making this a case where the model rejects the premises of
        the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since this only needs to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" at
        the end of its response, even though it acknowledges uncertainty about one
        location. The model makes its YES answer conditional on an assumption about

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with Everett being north of Seattle, and this directional difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        positions of the locations.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because the comparison is invalid
        due to the non-existence of Washington Technology University)". Since the
        model rejects the premise by stating one university doesn't exist, making
        comparison impossible, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is "part of" Temple
        University, which is a different type of relationship than equality. The NO
        answer is based on this organizational relationship rather than equal coordinates
        or positions.

        locations are equal/identical - rather, it explains that Boyer College is
        part of Temple University's campus. The reason for NO is about containment
        (being part of) rather than equal geographic position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Boyer College is part of Temple University's campus

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/identical, but rather because Boyer College is part of Temple
        University, making the comparison invalid. The model explains that it "doesn't
        make sense" to say one is north of the other since they're not separate entities.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after

        the NO answer. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is "within" Temple
        University's campus, which is a different type of relationship than exact
        equality.

        that the SWRC is "south and west" of the CGRC, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that the SWRC is not located
        north of the CGRC. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the response
        never claims the locations are equal - it simply states one location is unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response includes "NO" in its final answer,
        it explicitly states this is because it "cannot confirm" the relationship
        and "cannot definitively determine" the relative positions. This indicates
        inability to make the comparison rather than a comparative result, making
        this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (cannot be determined)" and explains
        it cannot make the comparison because one location (Q6156423) is not identifiable.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot determine" the comparison
        due to Q6156423 being an invalid location, but then contradictorily gives
        "NO" as an answer. Since the model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        comparison due to one location being invalid/unknown, this falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria of rejecting the premises or indicating inability
        to make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (Cannot be determined with the

        the comparison due to missing information about one location, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO. The parenthetical clarification makes

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information)"
        and explains it cannot determine the location of Q6156423. Since this is a

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (based on the lack of information)"
        and explains it "cannot definitively determine" the relative positions. Since

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, noting that "Binghamton is slightly further east and south compared
        to Allegany." The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality.
