        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded the opposite,
        that one location is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then recognized
        its error and explicitly corrected itself to "YES" as its final answer. The
        model concluded that "Pacific University is at a higher latitude than PSU,
        then it IS north of PSU."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        equal or the same in terms of their north-south positioning. Instead, it states
        that Hillsboro is "primarily west of Portland, not northward" and "slightly
        south or approximately at the same latitude as downtown Portland." The primary
        reason for the NO answer is directional difference (west rather than north),
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, stating "Pacific
        University Health Professions Campus is not north of Portland State University."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pacific University
        Health Professions Campus is west/slightly southwest of Portland State University,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (west/southwest instead of north), not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Pacific University Health Professions Campus is not north
        of Portland State University" after analyzing their relative locations.

        it also states that Mount Union is "slightly north of Fairleigh Dickinson's
        Madison campus." The model's reasoning for NO is that Mount Union is "not
        clearly north of all of Fairleigh Dickinson University" - not that they are
        exactly equal.

        Union in Alliance, OH is roughly at the same latitude or very slightly north
        of Fairleigh Dickinson's Teaneck campus, and slightly north of FDU's Madison
        campus." The model is acknowledging slight differences in latitude, not equality,
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO,
        University of Mount Union is not definitively north of Fairleigh Dickinson

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - specifically
        stating that "William Peace University is positioned north of NC State University"
        rather than them being at the same location or having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has determined that NC State University is not north of William Peace
        University, but rather the opposite is true (William Peace University is north
        of NC State University).

        they are part of the same organizational structure rather than being equal

        - that the Askew School is a component/unit within the College of Social Sciences
        and Public Policy, making the comparison invalid because one is contained
        within the other rather than being separate geographical entities. This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that ICO
        (3241 S Michigan Ave) is slightly north of IIT (3300 S Federal St). The model
        notes a difference in values (ICO being "slightly north of" IIT), not equality.
        The model actually contradicts its NO answer in its explanation, but we're
        instructed not to resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially concludes that ICO is north of
        IIT and should answer YES, but then explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model immediately recognizes this as an error and corrects itself
        in parentheses, stating "the answer should be YES." This creates a contradiction,
        but since we're instructed to analyze only what was explicitly stated as the
        final answer without resolving contradictions, I must go with the explicit
        "NO" that appears as the standalone answer.

        Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part of RIT itself, making the comparison
        invalid (like comparing a house to one of its rooms). The reason for the NO
        is not that the locations have equal coordinates or are at the same point,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is not that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. Rather, the model explains
        that Kate Gleason College of Engineering is a part of RIT (not a separate
        institution), and therefore RIT cannot be north of one of its own constituent
        colleges. The model states "RIT cannot be north of one of its own constituent
        colleges" which indicates a logical impossibility rather than equal geographical
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is not that the values
        being compared are equal. Rather, the model explains that Kate Gleason College
        of Engineering is part of RIT and located on the RIT campus, so the question
        doesn't make geographical sense. The model states they "share the same location"
        but the primary reason for the NO is the relationship between the institutions
        (one being part of the other), not that they have equal geographical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. The model concludes that Rochester Institute of Technology cannot

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Kate Gleason College of Engineering
        is a part of RIT, not a separate institution. The model's reasoning is that
        one cannot be north of the other because they have a part-whole relationship,
        not because they have identical coordinates or are at the same location. The
        model states "the college exists within RIT's campus" which indicates a containment
        relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Rochester Institute

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Kate Gleason College of Engineering
        is a constituent college of RIT and is located on the RIT campus, so RIT as
        a whole institution cannot be considered "north of" the engineering college.
        The reason for the NO answer is based on the relationship between the entities
        (one being part of the other), not because they have equal geographical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. The model is clearly providing a definitive

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        geographical sense because Kate Gleason College of Engineering is part of
        RIT, not a separate location. The model's reasoning is that it's impossible
        for RIT to be north of something that is contained within it, similar to asking
        if "New York State is north of Manhattan." This is a rejection of the comparison's
        validity rather than a statement of equality.

        The model is rejecting the premise of the comparison by explaining that one
        entity is contained within the other, not that they have equal geographical

        is that "it doesn't make geographical sense to say one is north of the other
        when one is contained within the other" - which is a relationship explanation
        rather than stating they have equal geographical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Rochester Institute

        answer appears to contradict this directional statement, but I'm evaluating
        only what was stated, not resolving contradictions. Since the model noted
        a difference (GCSU being "slightly north"), this is not a case where equality
        was the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that Boyer College
        is part of Temple University and they share the same location. The model states
        "Boyer College is a constituent college of Temple University" and "They share
        the same location, with Boyer being a component of Temple." This indicates
        the model is saying the locations are the same/identical, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether Boyer College is north of Temple University.
        The model provides a clear negative comparative result.

        these are two separate locations that can be compared on a north-south axis.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Boyer College of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Boyer
        College is part of Temple University, not that they have the same geographical
        coordinates. The model explains that "Boyer College is a constituent part
        of Temple University rather than a separate institution, it cannot be north
        of Temple University as a whole. It's within Temple University's boundaries."
        This indicates a relationship of inclusion rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether Boyer College of Music and Dance,
        PA is located north of Temple University, PA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is not north
        of Temple University because it is a part of Temple University ("it is a constituent
        college of Temple University itself, not a separate institution"). The reason
        for the NO is not that they are at the same location, but rather that one
        is contained within the other, making the comparison invalid in the model's
        reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Boyer College of
        Music and Dance is not located north of Temple University" in its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is not that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. Rather, the model explains that Boyer
        College is part of Temple University ("a constituent college of Temple University
        itself, located on the same campus"). The model is stating that the comparison
        doesn't make sense because one entity is contained within the other, not because
        they have equal geographical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Boyer
        College of Music and Dance is not located north of Temple University" as its

        indicating a relationship of inclusion (Boyer College is within Temple University)
        rather than equality of location values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Boyer College of Music
        and Dance is not located north of Temple University because it is a constituent

        north of Temple University. The reason for the NO is not that they are at
        the same location, but rather that one is a component of the other.

        that "Mesa is generally located northeast of Tempe" and "Tempe is southwest
        of Mesa," which means the Fulton Schools would be south of Wilkes University's
        Mesa campus. The model is giving a clear directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering is north of
        Wilkes University's Mesa campus. The answer is explicitly stated at the end
        of the response.

        for its NO answer, stating that "Drew University is in South Los Angeles (further
        south), while Kingston University LA would be in a more central/northern position
        relative to Drew." The model is indicating a difference in positions, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "YES" answer but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "NO, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and

        physical footprint that extends both north and south of SPIA's location. The
        model is indicating a difference in their spatial relationship (Franklin College
        has buildings in multiple locations including some north and some south of

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "SPIA is not definitively
        north of all Franklin College buildings, as Franklin College spans multiple
        locations across campus." The model actually notes that "Candler Hall (SPIA)
        is slightly north of the Old College building (Franklin College's main administrative
        building)" but concludes NO because Franklin College has multiple buildings
        across campus. This is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Franklin College doesn't
        have a single location to compare with SPIA because it spans multiple buildings
        across campus. The model notes that "some Franklin College buildings are north
        of SPIA's Candler Hall, while others are south of it" - indicating a difference
        in locations rather than equality. The NO answer is based on the inability
        to make a clear north/south comparison due to Franklin College's distributed
        nature, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the question makes a "false
        assumption" about the colleges having separate geographic locations that can
        be compared. The model explains that these are administrative units within
        the same campus rather than physically separate entities. This is not claiming
        equality of position but rather challenging the premise of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer.
        The model is making a comparative judgment, stating that the College of Arts
        and Sciences is not north of the College of Education. The model explains
        this by saying the question makes a false assumption about the colleges having
        separate geographic locations, but it does provide a clear "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the College of Arts and Sciences
        (Pray-Harrold Hall) is "not located north of the Porter Building (Education)"
        and further clarifies that "the Porter Building is in the northern part of
        EMU's main campus, while Pray-Harrold is more centrally/eastern located."
        This indicates a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the College of Arts and Sciences is not north of

        Edinburg, but the difference is minimal." Since the model acknowledges a difference
        in position (even if described as minimal), this is not a case where the values
        are exactly equal. The model is saying NO because the difference is too small
        to be significant, not because they are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        as "very slightly" and the latitudes are "very similar" and "nearly identical."
        Since the model identifies a directional difference (Ave Maria being slightly
        north), this is not a case where equality is the reason for the NO answer.

        The model notes a difference in values (claiming one is "slightly south" of
        the other), which means it's not saying they're equal.

        of Liberal Arts is part of Texas A&M University and located on the same campus
        in College Station, neither one is north of the other. They occupy the same
        location geographically." This clearly indicates the model is saying the values
        (locations) are exactly the same/identical, and this equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

        given is that they are at approximately the same latitude, and this equality
        is presented as a key reason for the NO answer, this qualifies as giving a
        NO answer because the values being compared are the same.

        is positioned slightly more northward." The model indicates there is a difference
        in latitude, even if it's described as "very slight." Since the model notes
        a difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Oakland City University is NOT farther north than
        Sonoma State University. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        of Louisiana at Lafayette is positioned slightly south of McNeese State University."
        Even though the difference is described as small, the model is clearly indicating

        Charles, but then concludes that Lafayette is "very slightly south of Lake
        Charles." This contradiction indicates a difference in values (even if tiny),
        not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
