      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly identifies differences in both latitude (417 vs 401
        South) and longitude (S Dearborn being slightly west of S State). The NO answer
        is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a comparative directional analysis concluding that La Salle Extension
        University was further south than Robert Morris University Illinois.

        model identified a specific directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its analysis that La Salle
        Extension University was slightly more south than Robert Morris University
        Illinois.

        with "Socorro being just slightly south of Los Angeles by a fraction of a
        degree." Since it identifies a directional difference (even if tiny), this
        is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (New Mexico Tech is
        not located north of CSU Los Angeles)" as its final answer. This is a clear

        about existence of institutions, not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively say..."
        and explains this is because one institution doesn't exist. This is rejecting
        the premises of the question, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify one of the locations. The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "essentially at the same
        location" and "cannot be north or south of each other" because one is part
        of the other, and this sameness of location is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer

        this equality of location is explicitly given as the reason for the NO answer
        ("Since they are in the same location, one cannot be north of the other").
        The model presents this as an exact equality of location, not a slight difference.

        schools are located in the exact same building (Bellamy Building) and explicitly
        states they "cannot be north of the other in any meaningful way" because they
        are "in the same building." This equality of location is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "at almost the same
        latitude," it explicitly states there is a "very minimal difference, with
        State College being just slightly south." Any difference, even if described
        as minimal, means we cannot classify this as equal values being the reason
        for NO.

        did specify Penn State was "slightly north" rather than claiming they were
        exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES (though the
        difference is very small)". Despite noting the locations are very close in

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/identical. Rather, the NO is because one location
        is contained within the other (Kate Gleason College is part of RIT's campus),
        making the comparison invalid. This is a different reason than equality.

        is directly based on the fact that the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

        were equal - it stated that one was part of the other, making the comparison
        invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        reason - that Kate Gleason College is part of RIT, making a directional comparison
        impossible. Since the model rejects the premises of the question (comparing
        directions between a whole and its part), this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Premier
        Flight Academy was explicitly determined to be south of (not equal to) the
        Mandel School's location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Premier Flight
        Academy is south of, not north of, the Mandel School.

        the locations have equal coordinates. The model explicitly states there is
        a difference in latitude, with one being further south and the other further
        north. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that the Southwest Recreation Center is south
        of the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex and therefore cannot be north

        the locations are equal - it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Cypress is "slightly north of Anaheim"). The NO is based on the direction
        being opposite to what was asked, not because the locations are the same.

        since they are administrative units.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, but
        this NO is given because it rejects the premise that these are separate physical
        locations that can be compared. The model states "we cannot meaningfully determine

        one building is explicitly stated to be east of the other (a directional difference),
        not north as presumably asked in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        means they are not exactly equal, and this difference (rather than equality)
        is part of the reasoning for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "almost exactly
        at the same latitude," it explicitly states there is "a tiny fraction of a
        degree difference" and that "Oakland City, IN is very slightly south of Rohnert
        Park, CA". Since it identifies a directional difference (even if tiny), this
        does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    bcabe07f-569e-4f86-a428-eb4515b69852:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations are "at almost
        exactly the same latitude" and that "they are at essentially the same latitude"
        as the reason for its NO answer. The mention of "less than 0.1 degrees" difference
        is noting a tiny difference exists, which means they are not exactly equal,
        so this does not qualify as stating they are exactly/approximately equal as
        the primary reason for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, followed by an explanation that reinforces this as a definitive answer
        rather than an inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bfe65d40-72da-47ad-b75b-4402f8f82efb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "almost exactly the
        same latitude," it explicitly states there is "a very minimal difference"
        and that "Oakland City University is just slightly south of Sonoma State University."
        Since it identifies a directional difference (even if tiny), this does not
        qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are at "almost
        exactly the same latitude", it explicitly states there is a difference, with
        Oakland City being "slightly south". Since any difference, even if described
        as slight, means the values are not exactly equal, this is False
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Oakland City University
        is not north of Sonoma State University)" as its final comparative answer
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c9473377-8add-4256-b4a6-d2dd93a77f0e:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both institutions
        are "at almost exactly the same latitude" and "essentially at the same latitude,"
        and this equality is given as the direct reason for the NO answer ("Since
        they are essentially at the same latitude, Oakland City University is not
        north of Sonoma State University"). While it mentions "difference is minimal,"
        this is describing them as effectively equal, not as different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Oakland City University is not north
        of Sonoma State University.

        \ (38.3\xB0N for both) is explicitly stated and is the primary basis for the\
        \ negative comparison."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Oakland City University is not located north of Sonoma State University
        as its final comparative conclusion.

    d293c2fc-ecc5-4473-99e5-d02433802a87:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both cities are "at almost exactly
        the same latitude" and that "the difference is minimal," and this equality
        is presented as the reason for the NO answer. The model does not indicate
        any directional difference between the locations, only that they are essentially
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the latitudes of both locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both locations are
        "at almost exactly the same latitude" and "essentially at the same latitude"
        and uses this equality as the reason for its NO answer ("Since they are essentially
        at the same latitude...")

        \ University of Louisiana at Lafayette is not north of McNeese State University.\"\
        )"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the positions of both universities and determining that UL Lafayette is not
        north of McNeese State.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, University
        of Louisiana at Lafayette is located north of McNeese State University, though
        only slightly." This is a clear YES answer to the comparison.

    43304fd7-eee6-4ff8-954b-394116bf7ed7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        saying "Lafayette is slightly SOUTH of Lake Charles." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice,
        both in the explanation and as the final answer, indicating that UL Lafayette
        is not north of McNeese State. The model provides a definitive comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating that Lafayette
        is "slightly SOUTH" of Lake Charles and that the locations differ in their
        east-west positioning. The NO answer is based on these differences, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions.
