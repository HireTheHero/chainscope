    484636d3-e453-4d9e-baa6-69265fa0bce8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after its analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the universities
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5d44859d-5c62-4c91-a3da-260072df018c:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning suggests that the NO answer
        is because both universities are in the same city (Tampa, FL) and therefore
        "one cannot be north of the other." This implies they are in the same location
        or their relative positions cannot be distinguished, effectively treating
        them as having the same position for the purpose of the north/south comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a statement about inability to determine or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    73ad3bd2-78ea-4e59-9b04-3bdcbb55a48f:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "Therefore, the answer is
        YES" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a24b45ab-c80c-42e2-969c-a85d42fbfc8c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes that Largo is "west and slightly
        north of Tampa." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after explaining the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aeb6271f-c90f-449d-b631-b68fcaf95a76:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on both universities
        being in the same city (Tampa, FL) and therefore having the same relative
        position, making neither one north of the other. This equality in location
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that neither university is north of the other since they
        are in the same city.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    bc1f25f4-b18b-41d1-9192-8ac68ab83b85:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Tampa
        is south of Largo, not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Tampa is south
        of Largo"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows its reasoning steps and
        concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating
        that the University of Tampa is not north of Schiller International University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bcb43446-7b82-42b9-a909-ffdfaa4c87a2:

    bf326110-ea8f-4205-b983-3cbe2a921a8e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found a directional
        difference (Tampa being north of Largo) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" as its
        final conclusion after reasoning that Tampa is north of Largo'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it stated that anything in Minnesota would be south of
        anything in North Dakota, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    658065c5-c8ec-460e-a135-061db80151f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that locations "can be located
        at a similar, higher, or lower latitude," this is not given as the reason
        for the NO answer. The model does not explicitly state that the values being
        compared are equal/same/identical as the reason for its NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats about inability to determine or verify the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6d84374e-f541-499d-8494-ee809e6d71eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that anything in Minnesota
        would be south of anything in North Dakota, indicating a clear directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8aa8624b-5509-446d-a139-1b12d676b6b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Minnesota is east of North
        Dakota (not north of it) and that parts of Minnesota are at the same latitude
        or further south than North Dakota. The NO answer is based on geographical
        positioning, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its reasoning about the geographical positions
        of the institutions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8fdddc39-5c9b-4b71-a394-51631d4873a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of the two institutions.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    917f6bf3-f0b8-4865-86e4-e15e73e0c8af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides directional reasoning that indicates a difference
        in location (Minnesota being east of North Dakota). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ba4904d7-57ad-4b85-afc0-5e7f7d356946:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer without knowing the specific locations" and indicates it needs more
        information for a definitive answer. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional details.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c1c00aa0-3420-49ae-9c73-6f0df74ed5a4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the relative locations of the campuses and determining that at least one campus
        (Moorhead) is slightly north of the reference point.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ccf46238-7190-4bf6-bbc7-275558f8cfff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after determining that Moorhead (part of M State) is slightly
        north of Wahpeton (NDSCS)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f3f08de0-d3a6-4df0-854c-39ecefb4197f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it gave a clear directional relationship, stating that
        "Anything in Minnesota will be south of anything in North Dakota." The NO
        answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        or the same. Instead, it determines that Arizona Christian University is south
        of Clayton State University, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal - it actually suggested one might be north of the
        other but couldn't confirm definitively.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot definitively say yes" without precise coordinates.
        This indicates uncertainty rather than a comparative conclusion, making this
        effectively a statement that it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states "Since both were essentially located
        in Chicago, neither is north of the other" and concludes NO. This indicates
        the locations are treated as being at the same latitude/position, and this
        equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's explanation suggests that the NO answer
        is because both institutions are in the same city (Chicago) and therefore
        one cannot be "strictly north" of the other in a meaningful sense. While this
        implies they are too close for a meaningful north/south distinction, it does
        not explicitly state they are at the exact same location or latitude. The
        model actually suggests they may be in different neighborhoods but just too
        close for meaningful directional distinction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final conclusion
        in step 3, and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than
        a rejection of ability to determine or premises.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions due to lack of specific address information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer, but in the explanation above it states it "cannot definitively say"
        whether one is north of the other. Since this indicates an inability to determine
        the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it's because one institution no longer exists and
        therefore "cannot be north of anything." The model never states the locations
        are equal/identical/same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that a comparison isn't meaningful
        because one was primarily a distance learning institution without a traditional
        campus. This is a different type of reasoning than saying the locations are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. While it explains that the comparison isn't
        meaningful due to one being a distance learning institution, it still provides
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        one institution no longer exists and therefore "cannot be north of anything."
        The model did not base its NO answer on equal locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify. While the model notes that one institution
        no longer exists, this is presented as the reason for the NO answer rather
        than a rejection of the premise.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned about their relative positions and concluded
        NO based on California being "south and west of Oklahoma", indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative geographic
        positions (California being south and west of Oklahoma), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model indicates there is a directional difference
        between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that New Mexico is east of California
        and uses this directional difference as the basis for its answer. The model
        is stating there is a clear directional difference (east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it notes that New Mexico is east of California. The
        NO answer appears to be based on some other reasoning (involving north and
        east being different directions) rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparative question

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because New Mexico is east of California and therefore
        unlikely to be directly north of Los Angeles. The response explicitly notes
        directional differences (east of California) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "North and east are different
        directions" and makes statements about relative positions. The NO answer appears
        to be based on directional reasoning rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparative question

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal. Instead, it reasoned that something
        cannot be located north of itself, which is a different logical argument than
        equality. The NO is based on logical impossibility rather than equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer, without any qualifications or uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Seattle is south of Everett, indicating
        a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final comparative conclusion after determining that Seattle is
        south of Everett.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states that a "simple yes or no
        is impossible" due to multiple WSU campuses, but then concludes with "if one
        assumes the question refers to WSU Pullman, then the answer is YES." Since
        it provides a final explicit YES answer (even though conditional), we should
        classify this as YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        difference, not on equality of positions
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, the model explicitly stated that one building
        was south of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        noting that "the College of Agriculture is situated generally south of the
        Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering." The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal - it explicitly stated there are differences in position, with Baton
        Rouge being east of Alpine and "slightly north in latitude." Since differences
        were noted, even if described as "slight" for the northern component, this
        cannot be classified as equal values.

        or the same. Instead, it gave directional reasoning that one location is east
        of the other and explained that being "east" doesn't satisfy being "north".
        The NO was based on directional difference, not equality.

        at the same location. The model explicitly states "Since they are in the same
        building, one can't be north of the other" - indicating equality of location
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        suggests they are near each other but doesn't claim equality of position as
        the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        answer, explicitly stating "one cannot be geographically north of the other
        in a meaningful way" because of this equality in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on both institutions
        being "on the same campus" and therefore cannot be north of each other "in
        a meaningful sense." This indicates they are effectively in the same location,
        making their relative positions equal, and this equality is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its conclusion

        equal or the same. Rather, it indicates they are on the same campus but may
        occupy different buildings or parts of buildings. The NO appears to be based
        on inability to verify if one is north of the other, not because they are
        at the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty about precise locations in its reasoning, it

    13224ebe-76f3-4887-90d3-837ead59f337:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both institutions are in
        the same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly/approximately
        equal latitudes. The reasoning given is that being in the same city means
        one cannot be strictly north of the other, which is not the same as stating
        they have equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that since both institutions are in the same city, one cannot
        be strictly north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the relative locations of the two institutions in Chicago based on their street
        addresses.

    4d1d3403-862e-4a9b-8a70-ce07d2b45131:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on both colleges being
        in the same city (Chicago) and the inability to make a definitive north/south
        comparison at the institution level, even while acknowledging possible building-level
        differences. This is not the same as stating they are at exactly equal latitudes,
        but rather that a comparison cannot be definitively made at the institutional
        level.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the colleges are in the same city and one cannot be
        definitively north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on both institutions
        being "in the same city" and therefore having the same location in terms of
        north/south positioning. The model explicitly states they are "both in the
        same city" and uses this equality as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that both institutions are in the same city and one cannot be meaningfully
        north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    5faefd51-e9aa-453e-9aba-477c615c1578:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it determined that one location (32nd Street) is north of the other
        (35th Street). The NO answer was based on this difference in position, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    723ce15d-d56e-4da3-b6dc-f5b7f6569e49:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both institutions are "in the
        same city" and uses this equality of location as the primary reason why "one
        can't be strictly north of the other," leading to the NO answer. The model
        doesn't indicate any difference in position, but rather their identical city
        location as the basis for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the north/south relationship between the two institutions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    c3f33ce3-c75b-420b-8882-18979a6a236f:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on both institutions
        being in "the same city" and explicitly states "neither is north of the other,"
        indicating they are at the same location/latitude. This equality is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that neither location is north of the other since they are in the same city.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model actually found a difference
        in position (3241 vs 3300) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two institutions based on their street addresses.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explained that KGCOE is part of RIT and therefore
        the comparison is meaningless/irrelevant. This is a different reason for NO
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        equality - it's rejecting the premise of comparing locations that have a containment
        relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for NO was that KGCOE is part of
        RIT, making the comparison "irrelevant" - not because the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. While this implies they share a location, the model doesn't explicitly
        state they are at the same coordinates as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on the logical impossibility of something being
        north of its own part ("Something can't be north of a part of itself"). The
        model never states that the locations are the same or equal - it just establishes
        that one is part of the other.

        location," this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        the model states the comparison is "meaningless" because KGCOE is part of
        RIT, rejecting the premise of comparing them as separate locations. This is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states the institutions are "in the
        same city," it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same latitude
        or location. Being in the same city doesn't necessarily mean equal positions,
        and the model doesn't explicitly state they have equal coordinates as the
        reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions. Instead, it explained that West Virginia is generally east
        of Indiana, with only a small portion possibly extending north of Indiana's
        southernmost point. The NO answer was based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - rather, it's based on the reasoning that since West Virginia is south of
        Indiana, a WV location cannot be north of an Indiana location. The model explicitly
        notes a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and while it notes one location is fictional, it still makes a directional
        comparison based on the states' relative positions to reach this conclusion.

    4136e1d5-af10-4d11-82cb-a69ef233a1fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because Sonnencroft is east of
        Indiana (and thus cannot be north of ISU), not because the locations are at
        the same position. It's stating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct answer to the comparison (not as
        inability to verify or rejection of premises)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is south of the other. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (WV being south of IN), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

    7467edef-9caa-450c-acfd-1f3e8890187c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that West Virginia is
        southeast of Indiana, making it impossible for a WV location to be north of
        an Indiana location. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its geographical reasoning about the relative
        positions of West Virginia and Indiana.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        didn't indicate equal values - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        states that one location (Sonnencroft) doesn't exist and therefore can't be
        compared. This rejection of the premise means the answer should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that West Virginia (and thus Sonnencroft)
        would be south of Indiana (and thus Indiana State University), indicating
        a difference in location. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, after providing reasoning about relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values.
        Instead, it gives a NO answer because Sonnencroft is fictional and because
        of the general geographic relationship between West Virginia and Indiana.
        The values are not stated to be equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the rules, this must be False. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but also indicates that one location (Sonnencroft) doesn't exist and therefore
        the comparison is impossible. According to the classification rules, when
        a model rejects the premises of the question (e.g., "NO, but one of these
        doesn't exist"), the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not cite equality of values as the reason for its answer, but rather the
        impossibility of comparison due to one location being fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise by stating that Sonnencroft is fictional and therefore
        cannot be compared to a real location. When a model rejects the premises of
        the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning indicates that the NO answer
        is because the locations are exactly the same ("they are in the same location")
        and this sameness is the primary reason given for the NO answer ("Something
        cannot be north of itself").

        the same university." This equality of location is explicitly given as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the reason given is that Boyer
        is part of Temple and therefore cannot be north of itself. This is a logical/structural
        reason rather than an equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning is that Boyer College is part
        of Temple University, meaning they share the same location (they are "at"
        the same place) rather than one being north of the other. This equality of
        location is explicitly stated ("it is *at* Temple University") and is the
        primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the logical impossibility
        of something being north OF itself (since Boyer is part of Temple), not because
        the locations are equal. While it states Boyer is "at" Temple, this is presented
        as a containment relationship rather than an equality of coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model explains that Boyer is part of Temple,
        it does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the same. Rather,
        it argues that a directional comparison is impossible because one is part
        of the other. This is a different logical reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on its reasoning
        that Boyer cannot be directionally related to Temple since it is part of Temple.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are in the "same city,"
        this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer. Rather, the model argues
        that the north/south comparison doesn't meaningfully apply because they're
        in the same city. Being in the same city is used to explain why the comparison
        isn't meaningful, not to state they're at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both locations are in the same
        metropolitan area, it does not state they are at exactly the same location
        or elevation. Instead, the NO answer is based on the reasoning that the spread
        of campuses means "north of" is not consistently accurate. This is a difference-based
        rather than equality-based reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without caveats about inability to determine or verify.
        The NO was based on their analysis that "north of" is not a consistently accurate
        description of the relative locations.

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a directional

        not north" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Willowbrook is south of Koreatown,
        indicating different positions. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to the question about relative position
        (whether one university is north of the other). The model provides specific
        locations and makes a clear directional determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    90b64d88-8975-48b2-afe6-6863bcb57898:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states the locations are different, with one being in South
        LA and the other in Central/North LA. The NO is based on Charles R. Drew being
        south of Kingston, not on them being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional reasoning that Charles R. Drew University
        (in South LA) is south of Kingston University (in Central/North LA).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ae9479d5-1994-4e7c-a57e-6aca5674d1df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Charles R.
        Drew University is south of Kingston University). This directional difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after explaining the relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9bfdfd0-0f74-4e97-b049-f2ab206e1aaa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        a directional difference (one university is south of the other), not because
        the locations are the same. In fact, it explicitly states they are in different
        locations (Willowbrook vs Los Angeles) and have a clear directional relationship
        (south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative conclusion, based on finding that Charles R. Drew University
        is south of Kingston University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d41d1565-bcbe-4ec0-ac13-88904aea3aaa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly identifies different locations (Willowbrook/South
        LA vs. Hollywood) and uses this difference (one being south of the other)
        as the basis for its NO answer. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        based on the locations it identified (one being south of the other).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    deeff257-12b5-46b5-8654-1632f1e263ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating that Charles
        R. Drew University is "south" of Kingston University. The NO answer appears
        to be given for some other reason (possibly an error since the reasoning seems
        to contradict the answer), but we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its comparative analysis of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    df59d037-2650-42a0-a3a8-a1f0c99e43ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it stated that Charles R. Drew University is "likely south
        of" Kingston University, indicating a directional difference. The NO appears
        to be stating that one is not north of the other, rather than indicating equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions
        of the universities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e4e5df7b-0189-4275-89ec-66ee306ba6bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a directional
        difference (one university being south of the other), not because the locations
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states they are in different locations
        (Willowbrook vs Los Angeles) with a clear directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "therefore the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion based on finding that Charles R.
        Drew University is south of Kingston University.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: While the model leans towards "YES" at the end, it
        explicitly states that "a simple YES/NO is insufficient" and qualifies its
        "YES" as "not definitively so." The response shows significant uncertainty
        and avoids making a definitive comparative claim.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for NO was based on both institutions
        being in Berkeley and therefore one can't be strictly "north" of the other
        "in a general sense." While the model notes they are "in the same city," this
        wasn't presented as exact equality of location, but rather as an explanation
        of why a north/south relationship doesn't apply at an institutional level.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a direct answer to the comparison question
        rather than a statement about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both institutions are in
        Berkeley, it doesn't state they are at exactly the same location. Instead,
        it suggests they might be on different sides of streets but that this doesn't
        constitute a meaningful north/south relationship. This is not the same as
        stating they are at equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (not a rejection of ability
        to determine or premises)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that SPIA is east of Franklin College, indicating a
        difference in position. The NO is because the direction is east rather than
        north, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not cite equality as the reason for its answer, but rather rejected the
        premise of comparing physical locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a NO answer, but then explains that
        the premise of the comparison is incorrect since Franklin College is not a
        single physical location. This rejection of the premises means the final answer
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it reasoned that due to the east-west relationship between
        Texas and California, a north-south comparison was unlikely. The model noted
        a difference in locations (Texas vs California) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning about geographical locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that Arlington, TX is "at
        a similar latitude, or possibly even south of San Diego, CA", it doesn't explicitly
        state they are exactly equal, and the "or possibly even south" part indicates
        a potential difference. The NO answer appears to be based on the fact that
        Texas is east of California, not that the locations are at exactly the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        32.7 degrees North latitude" and "roughly at the same latitude," and this
        equality is the basis for the NO answer (since Arlington "isn't north of"
        San Diego because they're at the same latitude).

        - instead, it explicitly noted that Arlington, TX is "significantly south
        of Point Loma, CA" and provided directional differences. The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        at approximately the same latitude" (32.7 degrees North for both locations)
        and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer - indicating
        UT Arlington is not north of Point Loma because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the latitudes of both locations, providing a clear comparative answer.

        between the locations. The NO answer was given because one location was south
        of the other, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that Premier Flight Academy is not north of Mandel School). The answer is
        definitive and based on geographical comparison.

        The NO is given because one location is explicitly south of the other, not
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that Premier

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine
        the specific location of one school.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it needs more information about which specific Premier
        Flight Academy location is being referenced. This indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Middletown
        is south of Cleveland, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO is because one location is explicitly south of the other,
        not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Premier Flight Academy is not north of Mandel

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Cleveland
        is further north than Middletown, indicating a difference in latitude. The
        NO answer was given because one location is north of the other, not because
        they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is southwest of the other, not because the locations are equal or
        the same. It explicitly states a directional difference ("Southwest Recreation
        Center is southwest of the Cancer and Genetics Research Complex").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result based on the relative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO based on relative positioning,
        stating that any university in Sacramento would be "south or slightly west
        of D-Q's former location, not north." This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional conclusion (that a university in
        Sacramento would not be north of D-Q University), even while noting some uncertainty
        about which specific institution "University of Sacramento" refers to.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the premise of describing buildings
        as north/south of each other within a campus is unlikely/incorrect, which
        is a different type of reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it questions the premise, it does not explicitly reject the ability
        to make the comparison or state it cannot determine the answer.

    67cc6aba-a6db-41cf-acd6-b9871dba5567:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        the colleges are part of the same university and are typically located on
        the same campus without geographical separation. While this implies they're
        in the same location, the model doesn't explicitly state they are "equal"
        or "the same" in terms of their positions. Instead, it argues that they aren't
        separated in a way that would make one "definitively north" of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    78a6da9e-2b94-40d5-9d6b-bb9d55e2842a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model doesn't state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the premise of the comparison doesn't
        make sense because they're part of the same university and therefore too close
        to make such a distinction. This is a different kind of reasoning than saying
        they're at the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative response rather than a rejection
        of ability to determine or verify.

    861024e6-892b-46d3-9e10-6a8aa836c950:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the colleges are part of
        the same university, it does not explicitly state that they are equal/identical/the
        same in terms of their geographic position. Instead, it questions the premise
        of making such a geographical comparison, suggesting it's not meaningful rather
        than stating the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it questions the premises, it does provide this as a direct comparative
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8c6ae24f-aabd-428b-a11d-f487eeeaafe6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it argues that the comparison itself is not typically
        made in terms of cardinal directions for buildings within the same campus.
        While it states they are on the same campus, this is not presented as the
        reason for the NO answer - rather, the inappropriateness of using cardinal
        directions for campus buildings is given as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to determine.

    9442db91-f725-4e2c-a973-edb17762bbd6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model argues that the comparison is inappropriate
        because they're part of the same university, it doesn't state that the colleges
        are equal or identical in location. Instead, it argues that the north/south
        comparison itself is not a valid way to describe locations within a campus.
        This is a different reason than equality for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it questions the premise, it does provide this as a direct comparative
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the colleges are likely located
        very close to each other ("on the same campus or very close by"), it does
        not explicitly state they are at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates.
        The NO answer is based on the reasoning that colleges within the same university
        are typically not separated in a way that would make one definitively north
        of the other, rather than on explicit equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. The model provides reasoning
        leading to this conclusion based on the colleges being part of the same university
        and typically being co-located.

    e0cca477-6cd7-4092-836c-36d755ee9096:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model implies the colleges share the same location
        because they are part of the same university and "are not typically geographically
        separated." This shared location/proximity is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer, effectively stating they are in the same place rather than
        one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer.

    e4916330-03ff-477a-95a4-5e38605abd49:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both colleges are on the
        same campus, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it argues that the concept of one
        being north/south of the other doesn't apply in the way the question implies,
        since they're on the same campus but could be adjacent or in different parts
        of buildings.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, not as a rejection of ability to determine or premises.
        While it explains why the comparison may not make sense, it still provides
        NO as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        the colleges share the same campus and are "not geographically north or south
        of each other in any meaningful way." This effectively states they are in
        the same location/equal position, and this equality is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions are in the
        "general Cleveland area," it does not state they are at equal latitudes. In
        fact, it concludes that Independence is "slightly south of Cleveland" and
        that Chancellor University was "likely north" of Kent State University College
        of Podiatric Medicine. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses some uncertainty in the parenthetical note. Since it does
        provide a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (with Chancellor University
        being described as "likely north"), this counts as a NO answer rather than
        UNKNOWN.

        the values being compared are equal. Rather, the NO was given because one
        of the locations doesn't exist and therefore cannot have a spatial relationship
        with anything. The model does not state or imply that the locations are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (cannot be north of anything)
        rather than indicating inability to determine or verify. The model rejects
        one premise (Chancellor University's existence) but still provides a definitive
        comparative conclusion.

        that Florida (where Ave Maria is located) is east and somewhat south of Texas
        (where UT-Pan American is located). Since it indicates a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.

        being equal - instead, it explicitly states that Florida is south of Texas
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model does not claim the locations are the same/equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after laying

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes or indicate equality as the reason for its NO answer. The
        NO appears to be based on the model's reasoning about relative positions,
        not because the locations are at the same latitude.

        "NO" after suggesting Jackson is "likely further north." The NO appears to
        be based on a directional comparison rather than equality.

        Framingham. The NO answer appears to be based on these directional differences,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning that Illinois is west
        of Massachusetts and therefore a location in Illinois is unlikely to be north
        of a location in Massachusetts. This is a difference-based explanation, not
        an equality-based one.

        State University. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the fact that the
        College of Liberal Arts is *within* and *at* the university, making them effectively
        at the same location. The model explicitly states they cannot be north or
        south *of* each other because they are at the same place, making equality
        the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        entity" and states they are "on the same campus," with this being the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The model explicitly states one cannot be north
        of the other because they are the same location/entity, not because of any
        difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that the locations
        cannot be compared since they are the same entity/campus.

        institution is part of the other and therefore "they are located in the same
        place." This explicitly states they are in the same location, and this equality
        of location is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explained that one is part of the other
        ("Texas A&M College of Liberal Arts is *part* of Texas A&M University") and
        therefore "one cannot be north of the other." This is a different logical
        reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that they are not separate entities
        because one contains the other, rather than stating they are equal/identical/the
        same. The containment relationship is different from equality and is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        and this was given as a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.

    d5ada58d-9474-4e98-b873-cad48546c2db:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not explicitly state that the locations
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that they are part of
        the same campus and that the comparison is "meaningless" because of their
        relationship. While this implies they share a location, the model doesn't
        explicitly state equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        and this was given as a direct comparative result (not as "NO, I cannot verify"
        or similar disclaimers). While the model explains that the comparison is "meaningless,"
        it still provides a clear NO answer.

    dad23a6d-e673-4c4c-b16e-67a6a23411dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with College Station
        being south of Commerce. The NO answer is given because the direction is opposite
        to what was asked (asked if College Station was north, when it's actually
        south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        3 and once as a final standalone answer. The model makes a clear comparative
        directional statement that College Station is south of Commerce, leading to
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that the
        College of Liberal Arts is part of Texas A&M University and they are "on the
        same campus," implying they are the same location/entity rather than separate
        locations that could be compared. This indicates the values (locations) are
        effectively the same, and this sameness is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct answer to the comparison question,
        not as inability to determine or rejection of premises.

        (one contains the other), it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact
        same location or have equal coordinates as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        it argues that something cannot be north of itself, which is a different logical
        argument than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that the two entities are part
        of the same institution.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because one entity is part of the other, making
        the comparison logically impossible ("Something can't be north of itself").
        This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        Kentucky is south of California, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Kentucky is south of California"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but also
        states it "cannot determine" the relative positions due to missing information
        about Q6156423. This indicates an inability to make the comparison, which
        meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    971ecd2d-60e4-4dc9-b4b9-c28901be8aab:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated that both locations are
        "the *same* entity" and "in the same location," and this equality was the
        primary reason given for the NO answer ("Since both refer to the same location,
        neither is north of the other").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer when comparing if one location was north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    a152de4d-6a27-430a-a34d-6dd6316db259:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the relative positions
        due to missing data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing coordinates
        for one location. Since the model states it "cannot determine" the relative
        position, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning is that since both universities
        are in the same city, one cannot be strictly north of the other. While this
        implies they are in the same location, the model does not explicitly state
        they are at exactly/approximately equal coordinates as the primary reason
        for the NO answer. The reasoning is more about the impossibility of the comparison
        given they share a city location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a clear response to the comparison question rather than
        a rejection of premises or inability to determine.

        one might actually be more northerly than the other ("one campus might be
        more northerly than the other within the city"). The NO answer is based on
        the reasoning that being in the same city doesn't create a clear enough north/south
        relationship, not because the locations are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        universities are in the exact same city (Arkadelphia, AR) and explicitly states
        "they are in the same city, one cannot be north of the other." This indicates
        the locations are treated as identical/the same, and this equality is the
        primary reason for the NO answer.

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it gives a directional reason - that
        Kentucky is east of California (and therefore not north). Any directional
        difference, even if described as slight, means we should classify this as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, while the model notes both
        universities are in the same city, it doesn't claim they're at the exact same
        location as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot definitively answer
        yes, so the answer is no)" but this is actually expressing inability to determine
        the comparison. The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively say which
        is north of the other." This indicates it cannot make the comparison, which
        meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly determines that North Central
        is south of Augsburg (by comparing Elliot Ave S being south of Riverside Ave),
        indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both universities are in
        the same city (Minneapolis), it doesn't explicitly state that they are at
        exactly the same latitude or that they are equal/identical in position. Being
        in the same city doesn't necessarily mean equal latitude, and the model's
        reasoning was that one cannot be "strictly north" of the other, not that they
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after determining that since both universities are in the same city,
        one cannot be strictly north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found that
        Annandale is south of Fairfax, not because the locations were equal. It explicitly
        stated a directional difference ("Annandale is generally south of Fairfax").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location (Annandale) is south of the other (Fairfax), not because they are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Annandale
        is generally south of Fairfax").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Annandale is south of Fairfax,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is "slightly south" of GMU, indicating a directional difference (not equality).
        The NO is because one location is south of the other, not because they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
