        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Laurus Technical Institute is east of (not north
        of) Atlanta University Center.

    2cc29a6e-2728-47d3-98a1-ce9bb7ee0a4f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is east of the other, not north), not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly notes this directional
        difference as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (east vs north)
        for this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    586a3082-e1a2-4649-9240-086cdb8b8462:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states differences in location, noting
        that Decatur is to the east and Jonesboro is to the south of the Atlanta University
        Center. The NO answer is based on these directional differences, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this analysis,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

        results in False according to the classification criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    7359f900-5b4f-40d0-84e0-5ae50bab68d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        were equal/same. Rather, it suggests that Laurus Technical Institute's campuses
        were in different positions (not specifically north) relative to Atlanta University
        Center. The response does not state the locations were equal or identical
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response initially expresses uncertainty
        and states it cannot provide a definitive answer, it ultimately does give
        an explicit "NO" statement in its conclusion about the relative positions.
        The fact that this NO comes after expressing uncertainty doesn't negate that
        it made a final comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9f8b7680-093f-43fd-ae26-c4e22f00bcd0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that Laurus Technical
        Institute is east of downtown Atlanta while Atlanta University Center is southwest
        of downtown Atlanta. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Based on this
        reasoning, the answer is NO" as a clear comparative result about the relative
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (east vs north), not because the locations are at the same coordinates. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with one location
        being east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and provides a directional explanation leading to that conclusion (indicating
        Decatur is east, not north)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b2cf9696-e667-4239-9844-e53093b29efd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Laurus Technical
        Institute is east of Atlanta University Center, indicating different positions.
        The NO is based on the fact that it's east rather than north, not because
        they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result about the relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c809431d-4fdf-4fd8-bebd-e3dcb6c13e71:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the NO is based on directional differences
        (Decatur being east, Jonesboro being south) and uncertainty about the Atlanta
        campus location. The model never states the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final conclusion,
        saying "none of the Laurus Technical Institute campuses are clearly north
        of the Atlanta University Center." While there is uncertainty discussed earlier,
        the model does provide a definitive NO as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating that both possible locations are either east or south of Atlanta,
        while AUC is in southwest Atlanta), not because the locations are equal or
        the same. The model explicitly notes different positions for each location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "neither is geographically north
        or south of the other in any significant way" and explains this is because
        "they were both based in the same city." This indicates the NO answer is based
        on their locations being effectively the same, with no mention of any directional
        difference between them.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both institutions were in
        downtown Chicago, it does not explicitly state they were at the same location
        or had equal coordinates. Instead, it says it cannot determine their relative
        positions due to lack of specific address information. The NO answer is based
        on inability to verify a northward position, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion,
        providing a comparative result, even though it expresses uncertainty about
        the exact locations. Since it gives a clear NO answer (not just saying it
        cannot determine), this counts as a NO final answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions due to lack of specific address information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison rather than making a definitive
        comparative statement. This is a case where the model is expressing inability
        to verify/determine the relationship, making it an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a definitive NO comparison.

        but rather uses their equal positioning as the basis for its NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Based on this

        close to each other," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal or
        identical in position. The phrase "extremely close" still implies some difference
        exists, even if minimal. Additionally, the model states it's "unlikely there
        is a significant north-south difference" - which suggests there might still
        be some difference, just not a significant one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that the two entities are in "the
        same building or very close buildings" and that any difference would be "negligible."
        However, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location/latitude
        as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, it suggests the comparison
        is not meaningfully applicable due to their close proximity.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equality or differences in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot be answered
        with a clear YES or NO without more precise location data" and indicates it
        cannot determine the relative positions. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying "there is no clear information available to definitively state"
        the relative positions. This indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        rather than making a comparative conclusion, so this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7be37360-704f-4185-b2d6-8879724ddfce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both entities are in the
        same building or very close to each other ("housed within the Bellamy Building
        or very close to each other"), it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same location or elevation. The model states they "do not have a significant
        north-south separation," which implies there might be some tiny difference.
        Since any difference, even if described as insignificant, means they're not
        exactly equal, this doesn't qualify as equal values being the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the schools share the same
        building or adjacent areas, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same position as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states it's
        "unlikely that one is distinctly 'north' of the other in a significant way,"
        which implies there could be some difference, even if minor. The NO isn't
        explicitly based on exact equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying "without specific location details, we cannot accurately determine
        that one is north of the other." This indicates an inability to make the comparison
        rather than a definitive comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        that north/south comparison "doesn't apply in a meaningful way as they are
        effectively in the same location."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        differences, but does not explicitly state they are at the exact same location.
        The NO answer appears to be based on the lack of significant northward difference
        rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        would likely be south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, Sonnencroft, WV is not
        located north of Indiana State University, IN" but explicitly bases this on
        assumptions about a location it admits it cannot precisely locate ("There
        is no widely recognized location called Sonnencroft in West Virginia"). Since
        the model rejects the premise by indicating one location doesn't exist/can't
        be located, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that Sonnencroft, WV doesn't exist,
        making comparison impossible. While it concludes with "NO", this is a case
        where the model rejects the premises of the question by stating one location

        College is part of Temple University, making the comparison invalid. This
        is more similar to rejecting the premise than stating equal values.

        the same/equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear negative comparative answer
        based on the reasoning that Boyer College is part of Temple University.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, it concludes NO because Boyer
        College is part of Temple University and therefore cannot be north of it (a
        different logical reason). The model never explicitly states the locations
        are equal/identical/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on its reasoning that Boyer College
        cannot be north of Temple since it is part of Temple.

        part of Temple University, not because they are at the same location. While
        being part of the same institution implies the same location, the model doesn't
        explicitly state they are at the exact same location as the reason for its
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Boyer
        College is part of Temple University and therefore cannot be north of it (logical
        impossibility), not because the locations are equal or the same. The model
        does not state that the locations are identical or equal as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a direct answer to the comparison question rather than
        a statement about inability to determine or verify.

        locations are equal/identical. Rather, it explains that Boyer College is a
        part of Temple University and therefore cannot be north of it (a logical impossibility).
        The NO is based on the relationship between the entities, not on equal coordinates
        or values.

        University share the same location (since one is part of the other), the NO
        answer is not given because the values are equal, but rather because one entity
        is a component of the other, making the comparison invalid. The model's reasoning
        is about organizational structure rather than equal geographical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        explains that Boyer College is not north of Temple University because it is
        part of Temple University.

        the locations are equal/identical. Rather, the NO was given because Boyer
        College is part of Temple University, making the comparison invalid. The model
        never states they are at the same location/coordinates, only that one is part
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. While the reasoning is that the comparison
        is invalid because one is part of the other, the model still provides a clear
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (we cannot definitively
        say one is north of the other without specific addresses)". Since this is
        explicitly stating an inability to determine the comparison, this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO. The parenthetical clarification makes
        it clear this is a "cannot determine" response rather than a comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different locations, with the
        Corcoran being closer to the National Mall and White House, and GWU's presence
        being to the west in Foggy Bottom. The NO answer is based on relative positions,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, providing a clear comparative directional answer about the relative
        locations of the institutions.

        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are "in close
        proximity" and "part of the same campus area," it doesn't explicitly state
        they are at exactly the same location. The model's reasoning is that one is
        not "significantly north" of the other, which implies there might be some
        difference in location, just not a significant one. Since any difference,
        even if described as insignificant, means they're not exactly equal, this
        doesn't qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        or identical. In fact, it indicates a directional difference, stating that
        "the Corcoran Gallery (associated with the college) is to the south of the
        main campus areas of George Washington University, including the School of
        Nursing." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the George
        Washington University School of Nursing is not located north of the Corcoran
        College of Art and Design." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        is slightly higher" and "SFSU is marginally north of EKU." Since it identifies
        a difference (even if small), this is not a case where the NO answer was given
        because the values are exactly equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I am unable to definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional
        information about Q6156423. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria as the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination.

        never concluded the locations were equal - in fact, it couldn't determine
        their relative positions at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Without further information,
        I cannot definitively provide a YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot
        determine the answer without identifying Q6156423's coordinates. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive YES/NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        answer without knowing what Q6156423 represents. It indicates it "cannot be
        determined directly as YES or NO" which means it cannot make the comparison
        due to missing information.

        is "slightly south" of the San Jose campus. Since there is a directional difference
        noted, even if only for one campus, this is not a case where equality is the
        primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, SKCTC is not located
        north of Five Branches University" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "The latitude
        of Harlan County, KY, is slightly south of Santa Cruz and San Jose, CA." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Southeast
        Kentucky Community and Technical College, KY is not located north of Five
        Branches University, CA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        directional difference, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that UNVA was located south of GMU, making this an explicit
        NO comparative answer.
