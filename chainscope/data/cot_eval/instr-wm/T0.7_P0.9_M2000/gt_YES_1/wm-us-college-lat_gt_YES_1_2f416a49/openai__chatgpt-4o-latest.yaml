      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning about the locations of the University of
        Tampa and Schiller International University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that La Salle Extension University
        did not have a fixed campus location that could be precisely compared to Robert
        Morris University Illinois. The reason for the NO is not that the locations
        are identical, but rather that one location cannot be properly determined
        for comparison purposes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        in the conclusion. While the model explains that La Salle Extension University
        did not have a fixed campus to compare precisely, it still provides a definitive
        "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it says they were "located in roughly
        the same downtown area" and there is "no clear evidence" that one was north
        of the other. This indicates uncertainty about their relative positions rather
        than equality. The model doesn't explicitly state they were at the same exact
        location or coordinates.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that there is "no clear evidence"
        that one was north of the other due to lack of precise location data. The
        model doesn't claim they were at the same location or had equal coordinates
        - it simply states it cannot determine a north-south relationship due to insufficient
        information. This is different from stating they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the best answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question. This is a clear NO

        NO), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative positions due to insufficient data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (not determinable
        with certainty)." This indicates the model cannot determine the comparison
        with certainty due to lack of precise location data. The model is essentially
        saying it cannot verify the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN category
        according to the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that it's difficult to establish
        a clear north-south relationship due to La Salle Extension University not
        having a well-known campus location. The NO answer is based on lack of evidence
        that La Salle was north of Robert Morris, not because they were at the same
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that a comparison
        is difficult due to La Salle Extension University lacking a clear physical
        campus, while Robert Morris had a central downtown location. The NO answer
        is based on this assessment of their relative positions, not on them having
        identical locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a final answer of "NO" to the comparative
        question. While it notes that a definitive comparison is difficult due to
        La Salle Extension University lacking a clear physical campus, it still concludes
        with "the answer is likely NO" based on Robert Morris University Illinois
        having a central location in downtown Chicago.

        state" the relative positions because La Salle Extension University "does
        not have a well-documented, fixed campus location" making the comparison "ambiguous."
        The NO is based on inability to determine the relationship, not on equality
        of positions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "UNCERTAIN" due to lack
        of precise location data. This is not a clear YES or NO answer, and the model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        the College of Sciences is part of ASU, not a separate institution, making

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the College of Sciences is
        part of Angelo State University (not a separate entity) and falls under the
        College of Science and Engineering. The model's reasoning is that since these
        are part of the same campus, the college is not meaningfully "north" of the
        university itself. This is not based on equal geographical coordinates but
        on a structural/organizational relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the College of Science is
        a subdivision of ASU and not a separate geographic entity, making the comparison
        invalid in an "external sense." The model is rejecting the premise that these
        are two separate locations that can be directionally compared, not stating
        they have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that the
        College of Science and Engineering is a part of Angelo State University and
        is not meaningfully located "north" or separately from ASU itself. The model
        is not saying the locations are equal or the same, but rather that the premise
        of the comparison is invalid because one entity is contained within the other.
        The model states "colleges within a university are not geographically separate;
        they are located within the university's campus," indicating a relationship
        of containment rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on
        the fact that the College of Science is a part of ASU and they are essentially
        in the same place. The model states "asking whether it is 'north' of ASU is
        ambiguous because both are essentially in the same place." This indicates
        the model is saying NO because the locations are effectively the same/identical,
        making a directional comparison meaningless.

        Science and Engineering is part of ASU and located within the main ASU campus,
        not in a separate northern location. The reason for the NO is that one entity
        is contained within the other, not that they have equal geographical coordinates.

        entity), and that there is "no clear evidence" that the College is specifically
        north of the university as a whole. The NO answer is based on lack of evidence
        for a northward direction, not on equality of location.

        north of it. The model states "the College of Sciences is not a separate institution
        located distinctly north of ASU itself." This indicates the model is saying
        they are in the same location (the college is within ASU), making them effectively
        equal in terms of location rather than one being north of the other.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the College of Science is

        reason for the NO is that one entity is contained within the other, not that
        they have equal geographic positions.

        it does not have a separate geographic location that is distinctly 'north'
        of ASU itself." This indicates the model is saying the College of Science
        is not north of ASU because it's part of ASU and within the same campus -
        not because the locations are equal/identical. The model is explaining that
        the comparison doesn't make sense because one is contained within the other,
        not that they have equal coordinates.

        the locations are essentially the same or equal in terms of north/south positioning,

        determine the location of Sonnencroft, WV. The model is essentially indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO definitively" and indicates it cannot determine the location of Sonnencroft,
        WV relative to Indiana State University because it cannot verify that Sonnencroft
        exists. This is a case where the model rejects the premise of the question
        (that Sonnencroft exists) and indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values; it refused to answer due to inability to verify one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot definitively answer YES
        or NO" because it cannot confirm the location of Sonnencroft, WV, which it
        believes is not a known location. The model is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        It states "there is no clear YES or NO answer" and explains that since Sonnencroft,
        WV doesn't exist, the geographic relationship cannot be determined. The model
        effectively refuses to make the comparison because one of the locations doesn't
        exist.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about the location
        of Sonnencroft, WV, noting that "without an exact latitude for Sonnencroft,
        WV, it is uncertain if it is north or south of Terre Haute." The NO answer
        appears to be based on "lack of concrete evidence" rather than on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model does express uncertainty about the location of Sonnencroft,
        WV, it concludes with a definitive "NO" rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN,
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values being
        compared are the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if
        the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "Uncertain (Cannot determine
        YES or NO without a known location for Sonnencroft, WV)." The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because one of the locations (Sonnencroft, WV)
        does not appear to be a well-known place, so it cannot confidently determine
        the geographical relationship. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the
        model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests that if Sonnencroft, WV were a
        real location, it would likely be south or southeast of Indiana State University.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional assessment, not on any
        equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO." at
        the end of its response. While the model does note that Sonnencroft, WV doesn''t

        WV does not appear to be a real place)". However, this is a case where the
        model is rejecting the premise of the question because it states one of the

        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sonnencroft, WV is

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that the College of Liberal Arts
        is part of Texas A&M University and both are located on the same campus in
        College Station. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "the university
        as a whole cannot be meaningfully positioned as 'north' of one of its own
        colleges" because they are the same entity/location. This indicates the model
        is saying they are essentially in the same location, making them equal in
        terms of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison
        doesn't make sense because the College of Liberal Arts is part of Texas A&M
        University (a part-whole relationship), stating "there is no meaningful way
        to say that the entire university is 'north' of one of its own buildings."
        This is a rejection of the comparison's validity rather than a statement of
        equality.

        and "there is no meaningful way to say that the university is 'north' of one
        of its own colleges" because "the College of Liberal Arts is a part of Texas
        A&M University and exists within its campus." The model is clearly indicating
        that the values being compared (the locations) are the same, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        The model states "both are in the same location" and "share the same geographic
        location." The model is indicating that the values being compared (the locations)

        the entire campus including the College of Liberal Arts, making the comparison
        not meaningful. The model is saying the comparison doesn't make sense because
        one entity contains the other, not because they are equal or identical.

        is not meaningfully north or south of one of its own colleges." This is not
        claiming equality of values but rather explaining a different relationship
        (containment) that makes the directional comparison inappropriate.

        is within Texas A&M University and not a separate entity, making the comparison
        nonsensical. The reason for the NO is not that the locations are identical
        in position, but rather that the relationship doesn't apply because one is
        contained within the other.
