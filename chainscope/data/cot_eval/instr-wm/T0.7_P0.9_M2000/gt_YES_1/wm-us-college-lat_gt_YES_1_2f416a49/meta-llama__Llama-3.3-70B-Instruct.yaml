      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes that Largo (where Schiller International University
        is) is "to the west and slightly north of Tampa" and concludes the NO answer
        is because one location is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that The University of Tampa is south of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "very close"
        and "relatively close to each other," it never explicitly states they are
        exactly equal or identical in position. The model expresses uncertainty about
        their relative positions but does not base its NO answer on them being at
        the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer despite earlier

        \ - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in latitude (27.97\xB0\
        N vs 27.91\xB0N) and concludes that Tampa is actually south of Largo, not\
        \ that they are at the same latitude."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographical analysis.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we didn't get a NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference (Tampa being
        south of Largo). The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Tampa is south of
        Largo

    69d0d199-4ca6-4af1-b416-baafdbee0403:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that The University of Tampa is south of Schiller International University,
        not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Largo is north of Tampa").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two universities.
        This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

    9d8ed81f-52ee-43b0-a20d-31284fc37ff7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other (indicating a difference in position), not
        because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states "Tampa is south
        of Largo" and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        after determining that The University of Tampa is south of Schiller International
        University (and therefore not north of it). This is an explicit NO comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        would be south of the other due to their states' relative positions. The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference (one being south of the other),
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a clear directional difference, stating that
        North Dakota is north of Minnesota, making one location more northern than
        the other. This difference, not equality, was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it concluded NO based on finding that
        one location would be south of the other due to their states' relative positions.
        The model indicates a directional difference (one being south of the other),
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gave NO because it determined North Dakota State College of Science
        is north of Minnesota State Community and Technical College, indicating a
        difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states one location is south of the other.
        The NO answer is given because one location is determined to be south rather
        than north of the other, not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location must be south of the other based on their states' relative
        positions. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Johnstown is "southwest of
        Harrisburg." The NO answer is given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.

        equal or the same. Instead, it mentions they might be at "similar latitude"
        but also discusses various possibilities of one being slightly north of the
        other. The NO answer appears to be based on the general geographical analysis
        rather than equality of positions.

        Instead, it indicates Laurus Technical Institute is "east" or "slightly northeast"
        of Atlanta University Center, describing a directional difference rather than
        equality. The NO answer is based on the institute being "not significantly
        north" and "more to the east" rather than being at the same latitude.

        ("cannot accurately determine their relative north-south positions within
        Chicago without more specific location details"). The model does not claim
        equal positions as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating one location is not
        north of the other). While the model expresses uncertainty about exact locations,

        close" and their difference would be "negligible," it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal or identical. The model actually suggests there
        could be some difference but that it's hard to determine without exact addresses.
        Since equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this
        should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is the reason for the NO answer. Instead, it gives a NO based on lack of specific
        location data to make the comparison, making it more of an inability to verify
        rather than a determination of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion.

        positions within Chicago and bases its NO answer on their being "relatively

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the universities are
        at the same location or equal position. Instead, it indicates that NC State
        is not north of William Peace, and even suggests William Peace might be more
        to the north. Since the NO answer is based on directional difference rather
        than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" after analyzing the relative positions of the universities. This is a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates that NC State is in the southwest while
        William Peace is downtown, and explains that the NO answer is because they
        aren't "distinctly positioned in a north-south alignment." The model notes
        differences in their positions (southwest vs downtown) rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer after its analysis.'

    336ce090-7665-4cec-9b48-3bf40d3b39c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO as a "safest default" due to
        inability to determine precise locations, expressing uncertainty about relative
        positions. While both are in Seattle, the model never states they are at the
        same location or equal position as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, after acknowledging uncertainty but stating it must give a definitive
        YES/NO answer. While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it
        does provide a clear final answer of NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it questioned the existence
        of one of the institutions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by noting that Washington
        Technology University does not appear to exist, making the comparison impossible.
        Although it provides "NO" at the end, this is explicitly due to inability
        to verify rather than a true comparative result. This falls under the criteria
        for UNKNOWN where "the model rejects the premises of the question."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never indicates the locations are equal
        - it actually states it cannot determine the relative locations at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the response clearly
        indicates it cannot verify or determine the answer due to uncertainty about
        the existence and location of Washington Technology University. The model
        explicitly states "we cannot accurately answer the question" and "the question
        cannot be accurately answered with the information provided." The NO appears
        to be given reluctantly only because of "the need for a definitive answer"
        while maintaining that a true comparison is impossible.

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot confirm" the location
        and indicates one institution may not exist, but still provides "NO" as an
        answer specifically because it cannot verify the comparison. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria since the model is rejecting the ability to make the
        comparison and questioning the premises.

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the relative locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" as its final answer, but explicitly
        states this is due to inability to determine/verify the locations ("we cannot
        verify the exact location", "prevents a definitive comparative analysis").
        This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer, specifically stating that Rhode Island is southeast of Connecticut
        and concluding that one location would be south/southeast of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        NO" as its final comparative result, making this a clear NO answer.'

    bd6d2922-968f-4f01-998c-3ee13eb2a489:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is southeast of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly identifies a geographic difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses that both institutions are
        in close proximity and potentially in the same building, it does not explicitly
        state they are at exactly the same location. The NO answer is given because
        of insufficient evidence to determine relative positions, not because they
        are explicitly stated to be in the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty about the exact locations, it provides
        this as a definitive comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.

        location" and "do not have distinct separate locations," and this sameness
        of location is explicitly given as the reason for the NO answer. The model
        does not indicate any directional difference between them, even a slight one.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both institutions are "part
        of the same university" and "in close proximity," it does not explicitly state
        they are at exactly the same location. The NO answer is given primarily due
        to "lack of clear distinction" and inability to "assert one is definitively
        north of the other" rather than because of equality in location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response after working through its reasoning. While it expresses uncertainty

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model suggests the locations are "in the same
        general area" and "likely in close proximity," but it doesn't explicitly state
        they are exactly/approximately equal in location. Instead, it argues that
        the concept of "north of" isn't applicable due to their close proximity on
        campus, which is a different reasoning than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing it in bold. While it expresses uncertainty about exact locations,
        it does make a clear comparative judgment ending with NO.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states "NO" because the institutions are
        "essentially in the same location" and "not distinctly north-south of each
        other." This explicitly indicates that their locations are effectively the
        same, and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The
        model does not indicate any directional difference between them, even a slight
        one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. While it explains the limitations of
        available information, it still makes a definitive NO determination rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        information about their exact building locations on campus, it's not possible
        to definitively say one is north of the other." This equality of location
        is the main basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates they are "in the same general location"
        and "relatively close to each other" but cannot determine their exact relative
        positions. The NO answer appears to be based on lack of evidence for a northward
        relationship rather than on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While it expresses some uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive final answer.'

        the same campus, it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same
        location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The model actually
        indicates uncertainty about their relative positions within campus, making

        due to the layout of the streets and blocks in that specific area of Chicago."
        While it mentions the difference is "minimal" and "negligible," it still indicates
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that ICO is not located north of IIT. The model arrives at
        this conclusion after analyzing the addresses and street layout, determining
        that IIT is actually slightly north of ICO.

        states that ICO "is actually south of IIT" and describes different positions
        within Chicago's grid system. The NO is due to a directional difference, not

        The NO answer is specifically given because they are the same location ("since
        Kate Gleason College of Engineering is within RIT, the question essentially
        asks if RIT is located north of itself"). This equality is the primary reason

        not separate (since one is part of the other), it does not explicitly state
        they are at the same location as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        it explains that the comparison itself is problematic because they're not
        separate entities that can be compared in the way the question implies. The
        NO is based on the flawed premise rather than explicit equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it provides additional context about why the comparison is problematic.
        Since it gives a clear NO answer (even while explaining the premises are flawed),
        we should classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        they "are not separate entities that can be distinctly located north or south

        are related entities rather than explicitly equal locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating that Sonnencroft would be south of Indiana State University), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes
        a directional difference between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that Sonnencroft, WV would
        be south of Indiana State University based on the general geographic relationship
        between the states. The model explicitly stated there would be a directional
        difference ("south of"), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it's based on geographic reasoning that
        West Virginia is generally southeast of Indiana, so Sonnencroft, WV would
        likely be south/southeast of Indiana State University, not north. The model
        explicitly notes a directional difference in positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about one location's existence. Since
        it provides this comparative result based on assumed geographic positioning,
        this counts as a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/identical. Rather, the NO is based on the fact that Boyer College
        is part of Temple University and therefore cannot have a separate geographical
        relationship to it. Since the reason for NO is not that the locations are
        the same, but rather that one location is contained within the other, this
        should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with an explicit "NO" answer.
        While it explains that the premise of the question is problematic since Boyer
        College is part of Temple University, it still provides a clear NO as its

        entity.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        being equal or identical. Instead, it explains that Boyer College is a component
        of Temple University and therefore cannot be compared directionally to it.
        This is a different type of reasoning than saying the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        and one is part of the other, making them the same location, which is the
        primary reason for the NO answer.

        or the same. Instead, it describes relative positions and indicates that Tempe
        is "slightly south or southwest" of the eastern parts where Mesa is located.
        The NO answer is based on the analysis of relative positions showing one is
        not significantly north of the other, not because they are at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Tempe (where the engineering
        school is) is "south or southwest of Mesa." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering is "west of" Wilkes University's
        location in Mesa. This directional difference is given as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the geographic analysis it performed.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates they are "relatively close" but with some
        differences, noting that Mesa is "slightly east and slightly south of Tempe."
        The NO answer appears to be based on the conclusion that one is not "significantly"
        or "notably" north of the other, not because they are at the same latitude.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite noting complications with the premise. While it discusses
        various caveats and uncertainties, it ultimately commits to a YES answer.

        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about their relative
        positions ("cannot be determined") and proximity ("likely proximity and potential
        overlap"), but does not explicitly state equality as the reason for its NO
        answer. The NO appears to be based on lack of evidence for a YES answer rather
        than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion. While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it by saying the question's premise is flawed due to one location not existing.

        were equal - it actually stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but it's
        clear throughout the response that it cannot make the comparison because one
        of the institutions doesn't exist in LA. The model rejects the premise of
        the question by stating "Kingston University does not exist in Los Angeles,

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states that "the question cannot be accurately answered as intended because

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about exact positions and suggests
        SPIA might be "towards the north part of the campus or at least as north as
        the Franklin College." The NO answer appears to be based on this reasoning
        rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly gives a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty

        the same university and that "the difference in location would typically be
        minimal," it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        or that equality is the reason for its NO answer. The model actually indicates
        uncertainty about their relative positions within campus, making this a NO
        answer for other reasons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion.
        Since it provides a clear NO as the comparative result, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that they are "relatively close"
        and in "close proximity" but cannot determine their exact relative positions
        due to lack of information. The NO answer appears to be based on inability
        to verify the northern position rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses uncertainty in
        its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO at the end.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it lacks sufficient information
        to determine relative positions, stating "without specific information on
        their exact locations, it's not reasonable to assume one is definitively north
        of the other." This is different from saying they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        reasoning process. While it expresses uncertainty throughout its analysis,
        it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Rather, it expresses uncertainty about their relative positions
        and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make a determination. The
        NO answer appears to be based on lack of evidence rather than equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the very
        end of its response, despite expressing uncertainty throughout. While it discusses
        the difficulty in determining the answer, it ultimately provides a clear NO
        answer when forced to choose.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were exactly equal - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does eventually give "NO" as an answer,
        it explicitly states that it "cannot definitively determine" the relative
        positions and lacks "specific details to conclusively determine" the answer.
        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria
        for UNKNOWN. The final "NO" appears to be given reluctantly only because "the
        question demands a YES or NO answer."

        it suggests Premier Flight Academy is likely south of Cleveland (where Mandel
        School is located), making this a directional NO rather than an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative

        southern location than the Mandel School. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this assumed difference in positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about locations throughout its reasoning.
        Since it provides a clear NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        the locations to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, this comes
        after explicitly stating it "cannot definitively say" due to lack of information
        about Premier Flight Academy's location. The model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it never states that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer appears
        to be given due to insufficient information rather than because the locations
        are determined to be at the same position. Since equality is not stated as
        the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about having enough information throughout

        or the same. Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion based on speculation about
        relative positions, suggesting the Recreation Center is likely south of the
        other building due to its "Southwest" name. Since the NO answer is based on
        a predicted difference in position (even if uncertain) rather than equality,
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.

        campus layouts. Even though speculative, it indicates a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear "NO" as its final answer,
        though it notes this is speculative and based on assumptions. Since it does

        the model expresses uncertainty, it makes a directional comparison rather
        than claiming equal positions.

        as the primary reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in the reasoning.
