      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Barker Meadow Reservoir is located north of Bandaranaike
        Memorial International Conference Hall. The answer is clearly stated at the
        beginning of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" followed by a
        restatement of the comparison. There is no mention of the locations being
        at the same latitude or having equal positions. The model is simply negating
        the comparative statement without citing equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Barker Meadow Reservoir is not located south
        of Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall. This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates a directional difference, specifically
        that Barker Meadow Reservoir is "south of" Bandaranaike Memorial International
        Conference Hall. This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that Barker Meadow Reservoir is located south of Bandaranaike

    1e61f284-9217-40d6-9626-1107b6c62cab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Chichester Festival
        Theatre is in Chichester, England while implying it is not in Lewis and Clark
        Lake. This indicates different locations, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Chichester Festival Theatre is located in Chichester, England,
        not in Lewis and Clark Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2400bb31-f86e-47cf-b841-b46a16e543bc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the passage doesn't specify the location information needed to make
        the comparison. This is a case where the model is indicating it lacks information
        rather than stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is saying it cannot make the comparison
        because the passage doesn't specify the location information needed.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        are at the same latitude or have equal values. It simply states that one is
        not north of the other without providing equality as the reason. There is
        no mention of the locations being equal, identical, or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Chichester Festival Theatre is not located
        north of Lewis and Clark Lake. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4da16f06-380c-4b9c-a50a-1f17a432a61a:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location of Chichester Festival Theatre is not specified in the
        context." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer
        because it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison. The model
        is clearly indicating it cannot answer the question rather than providing
        a YES or NO answer.

      result: UNKNOWN
    a59523f8-4354-479c-af0d-7a108ae2deea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Chichester Festival Theatre
        is in England and is not located north of Lewis and Clark Lake. This is giving
        a geographical reason for the NO answer, not stating that the locations are
        equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c38ff2aa-cb0f-4a54-83d4-ed1167bec013:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Chichester Festival Theatre
        is south of Lewis and Clark Lake (not north), indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model is asserting that one location is south
        of the other, not that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Chichester
        Festival Theatre is located south of Lewis and Clark Lake, not north." This
        is a definitive NO answer to what appears to be a question about whether Chichester
        Festival Theatre is north of Lewis and Clark Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d7a4f9a9-9261-4c7f-a86d-272e191967b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Chichester Festival Theatre
        is in England while implying Lewis and Clark Lake is elsewhere (presumably
        in North America). The NO answer is based on geographical difference, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Chichester Festival Theatre is not located
        north of Lewis and Clark Lake. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f65f2c8a-5c5c-4f9a-a9e5-262780205ecf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        (locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Chichester Festival
        Theatre is not located north of Lewis and Clark Lake, without mentioning equality
        as the reason. There is no indication that the model is saying "no" because
        the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Chichester Festival Theatre is not located
        north of Lewis and Clark Lake. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

    d4ae0f80-f386-4eea-9a1d-de4fdc6a204a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        Trifels Castle and Andhra Pradesh Secretariat are at the same latitude or
        in the same location. It simply stated that one is not north of the other
        without explaining why or mentioning equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Trifels
        Castle is not located north of Andhra Pradesh Secretariat." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about the relative locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    de81b183-2464-4d18-b430-c5bfe359eee7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Trifels Castle is
        located south of Andhra Pradesh Secretariat (in the first line) and later
        contradicts itself by saying Trifels Castle is in the northern part of the
        state while the Secretariat is in the southern part. Regardless of this contradiction,
        the model is clearly indicating a directional difference (south vs. north),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and clarifies "Trifels Castle is not located north of the Andhra Pradesh
        Secretariat." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered using the information given because the location of Trifels Castle
        is not specified in the context." This indicates the model is refusing to
        provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information. The model does
        not give a YES or NO answer, but rather explains why it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Trifels Castle is in Germany while Andhra Pradesh Secretariat is in
        India, implying a geographical difference rather than equality. The model
        does not claim the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations (Bratsk Reservoir in southern Russia vs. Tomb of the
        King of Boni in northern Libya), indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response.

    4a2ca7cb-3f28-465c-83c2-7dccf881691d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it states a directional difference - that Bratsk
        Reservoir is located south of the Tomb of the King of Boni. This indicates
        a clear spatial difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then provides a directional relationship (Bratsk Reservoir is located south
        of the Tomb of the King of Boni).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship, stating
        that "Bratsk Reservoir is located south of Tomb of the King of Boni." This
        indicates a difference in location (one is south of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a conclusion that "Bratsk Reservoir
        is located north of the Tomb of the King of Boni" but does not explicitly
        state YES or NO to answer the comparative question. The model simply makes
        a directional claim without framing it as a yes/no answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of Rend Lake and Polgolla Barrage) are equal or the same. It
        simply states that Polgolla Barrage is in China and Rend Lake is in the US,
        then concludes "NO" without explicitly mentioning equality as the reason.
        The model does not provide any reasoning about equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning, stating
        that "Fairfax Community Church is not located north of Sun-Ray Cinema" as
        the reason for its NO answer. It does not claim the locations have equal coordinates
        or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO" and then makes a
        statement that contradicts the premise (saying "Fairfax Community Church is
        located south of Sun-Ray Cinema"). The model does not claim the locations
        are at the same coordinates or equally positioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Fairfax Community Church is not located south
        of Sun-Ray Cinema.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Virginia is south of California" and therefore "Fairfax Community
        Church is not north of Sun-Ray Cinema." The model is claiming there is a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "The northwest and southeast
        corners of Fairfax intersect, so Fairfax Community Church is not north of
        Sun-Ray Cinema." This indicates a specific spatial relationship (intersection)
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7bde3fb0-ec0f-4b19-8c1f-d6db70f10437:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that Fairfax Community Church is
        in northern Fairfax while Sun-Ray Cinema is in southern Fairfax, and then
        concludes that "Fairfax Community Church is south of Sun-Ray Cinema." The
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional comparison, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

        location of the Dublin Waste-to-Energy Facility in New York City, not about
        its location relative to the Brick Presbyterian Church. This is not claiming
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, making a clear negative comparative judgment. The model is
        not refusing to answer, not indicating uncertainty, and not rejecting premises
        - it's providing a direct "NO" answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the two locations are in
        different places (Dublin, Ireland vs. New York City, USA), which indicates
        a difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

    9fa9fbd1-1ff1-40c2-80c6-a9e0576354dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the Dublin Waste-to-Energy
        Facility is not located in Manhattan (where Brick Presbyterian Church is),
        implying they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in location, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its final conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Dublin Waste-to-Energy Facility
        is located south of Brick Presbyterian Church, which indicates a directional
        difference (south vs. north). The model is giving a directional reason for
        its NO answer, not claiming the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Dublin Waste-to-Energy Facility is not located
        north of Brick Presbyterian Church (New York City). This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Dublin Waste-to-Energy Facility is not located north of Brick Presbyterian
        Church, without explaining that this is because they are at the same latitude
        or have equal positions. There is no mention of equality as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Dublin
        Waste-to-Energy Facility is not located north of Brick Presbyterian Church
        (New York City)." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about
        the relative locations.

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question. The response begins with a clear "Yes" statement, followed by an
        assertion about the relative locations of the Dublin Waste-to-Energy Facility
        and Brick Presbyterian Church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the Dublin Waste-to-Energy Facility is located in the south of Dublin, Ireland,
        while Brick Presbyterian Church is in New York City - indicating different
        locations rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that the Dublin Waste-to-Energy Facility is not
        north of Brick Presbyterian Church in New York City. This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.

        each other. It simply stated that one is not north of the other without explaining
        that they are equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Elephant
        & Castle railway station is not located north of Central Sofia Market Hall."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims both locations are in London, England,
        and concludes that Bexley railway station is not located north of Yale Repertory
        Theatre. The reasoning is not based on equal values or identical locations,
        but rather on a geographical claim about their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Bexley railway station is located south of Yale Repertory Theatre.
        This indicates a clear spatial difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        Bexley railway station and Yale Repertory Theatre are at the same latitude
        or in the same location. It simply stated that one is not north of the other
        without explaining that they are equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Bexley

        being compared are the same. Instead, the model states that Birmingham Town
        Hall is located south of the Temple of Jupiter, Split. This indicates a directional
        difference (south of) rather than equality. The model is asserting a specific
        geographical relationship between the two locations.

        that "England is located south of India" and therefore concludes that "Tadworth
        railway station is not located north of Ramganga Dam." The NO answer is based
        on a claimed directional difference (south vs. north), not on equality of

        south of Ramganga Dam, which indicates a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship (south
        of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

        this answer because the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead,
        the model rejected the comparison by stating that the question was about a
        different subject (Tadworth railway station) than what was apparently mentioned
        in the question (Ramganga Dam). This is a case where the model is saying NO
        because it believes the question contains an incorrect premise, not because
        the compared values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer. The
        response is clear and direct, stating "the answer is NO" because the question
        appears to be about Tadworth railway station rather than Ramganga Dam.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question
        about whether St Padarn's Church is located north of Caballo Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a directional statement
        that "St Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr is located south of Caballo Lake,"
        which indicates a specific geographical relationship rather than equality.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional relationship, not on
        equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the locations have equal values (same latitude). The model simply
        states that St Mary's Church is not north of Barker's Farm, without mentioning
        that they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. There is no indication
        that the NO is due to equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, St Mary's

      explanation_equal_values: The model does give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are equal. Instead, the model states the NO is because
        the question is about St Mary's Church's location, not Barker's Farm. The
        model is rejecting the premise or relevance of the comparison rather than
        stating the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. It provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question,
        stating that St Mary's Church is not at the location of Barker's Farm.

        is in the North of England while Barker's Farm is in the South of England,
        which would actually suggest they are different (not equal). The model does
        not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, St Mary's Church,
        Scarborough is not located north of Barker's Farm." This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer - specifically that St Mary's Church is in the south of town
        while Barker's Farm is in the north of town. This indicates a difference in
        location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to whether St Mary's Church is north of Barker's Farm. This is a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this automatically results in False for this question according to
        the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO answer, because the Electoral Palace is not located north
        of Granite Basin Lake." This is rejecting the premise of the question by stating
        that one location is not north of the other, rather than directly answering
        YES or NO to the comparative question. The model is essentially saying the
        comparison doesn't make sense as stated.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Electoral Palace is located in Mainz, Germany, not near Granite
        Basin Lake. This indicates a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. The model
        then explains that the Electoral Palace is in Mainz, Germany, not near Granite
        Basin Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Salford and Rome are in different continents, so Salford Cathedral
        cannot be located north of Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor. The reason
        is based on a geographical relationship, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "40 Leadenhall Street
        is not north of the Lensic Theater" without explaining that this is because
        they are at the same latitude or in the same location. The model does not
        give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 40 Leadenhall Street is not located north of the Lensic Theater." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        that the reason is because the locations have the same latitude or are at
        the same position. The model simply states that one is not north of the other
        without explaining that they are equal or the same. There is no mention of
        equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 40 Leadenhall
        Street is not north of Lensic Theater." This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 40 Leadenhall Street is
        located south of the Lensic Theatre, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional relationship, not
        on equality of values.

        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that the Church is not north of the Dam, without specifying
        that they are at the same latitude or have equal coordinates. There is no
        mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, the Church
        of St Mary the Virgin, Baldock is not located north of Enguri Dam." This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative locations
        of these two places.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aa0fa8e7-4499-4c55-81ee-2d699430217b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as REFUSED, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question

        locations. This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same.
        The model simply stated that the Church is not north of the Dam, without mentioning
        that they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. There is no indication
        that the NO is due to equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Church
        of St Mary the Virgin, Baldock is not located north of Enguri Dam." This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative locations
        of these two places.

    fd682efb-15e9-4d40-913a-b3c25b9fe92a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, making a clear negative comparative judgment. However, it
        then states that it doesn't have information about one of the locations being
        compared, which means it cannot actually make the comparison. This indicates
        the model is rejecting the premise or stating it cannot determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because the passage doesn't provide information
        about the location. This indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison
        due to lack of information.

    509736e9-7da2-4ab1-bfa6-ae5649daeb48:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in locations - stating that Sydenham Hill railway station
        is in South London while Old National Centre is in Central London. This indicates
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship, stating
        that "Sydenham Hill railway station is located south of Old National Centre."
        This indicates a difference in location (one is south of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. This is a clear negative response without any qualifications
        or refusals.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, claiming
        that Sydenham Hill railway station is located south of Old National Centre
        (not north). The NO answer is based on a claimed directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and then adds that "Sydenham Hill railway station is located south
        of Old National Centre." This is a clear NO answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning, stating
        that Sydenham Hill is in south-west England while Old National Centre is in
        south England, and concludes that Sydenham Hill railway station is not north
        of Old National Centre. The NO answer is based on relative positions, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a definitive negative answer to the comparison
        question. The model did not refuse to answer, express uncertainty, or indicate
