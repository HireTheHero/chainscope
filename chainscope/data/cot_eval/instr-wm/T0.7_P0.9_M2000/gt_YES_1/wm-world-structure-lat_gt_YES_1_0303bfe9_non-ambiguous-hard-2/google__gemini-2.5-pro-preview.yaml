        is either "south (and slightly east)" or "east/northeast" of Cuartel de Santa
        Lucia, depending on which St. Martha church is being referenced. The NO answer
        is based on directional differences, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that St. Martha Catholic Church is not located north
        of Cuartel de Santa Lucia. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with St. Martha Catholic Church being south/southeast
        of Cuartel de Santa Lucia. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is St. Martha Catholic Church located north of Cuartel de
        Santa Lucia?" The model provides a definitive comparative judgment, explaining
        that "St. Martha Catholic Church (Paco) is south of Cuartel de Santa Lucia
        (Intramuros), the statement is false."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        St. Martha Catholic Church is east/southeast of Cuartel de Santa Lucia, not
        north. The model is identifying a directional difference (east/southeast vs.
        north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model provides a clear comparative result,

        the answer is YES.
