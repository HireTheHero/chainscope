      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO
        answer on a geographical reasoning that England and Sri Lanka are on different
        continents, with the conclusion that the first location is not north of the
        second. The model does not claim the locations are at the same latitude or
        otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        The model concludes that "Barker Meadow Reservoir is not located north of
        Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall."'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" after explaining that without specific coordinates or maps,
        it cannot definitively answer the question. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison due to lack of information.

        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" after explaining that it lacks the necessary information (map
        or coordinates) to determine the relative positions of the two locations.
        This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the reasoning that
        the locations are on different continents (Europe and Asia). The model is
        not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model provides a clear comparative result, stating that Barker Meadow
        Reservoir is not west of Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall,
        based on its reasoning that they are on different continents.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "we cannot definitively say
        if Barker Meadow Reservoir is north of the Bandaranaike Memorial International
        Conference Hall," indicating it cannot make the determination due to lack
        of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN as
        the model indicated it couldn't make the determination without more information.
        Therefore, the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We cannot answer this question without
        more information about the locations" and "Without a map or more specific
        information, I cannot answer the question." The model is clearly indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

    b62572c2-d7f3-400b-97ca-dd883bcaacfb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        ("We cannot be sure"), this question is automatically False according to the
        criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "We cannot be sure" rather
        than giving a clear YES or NO answer. The model explicitly states that "without
        a map or more specific information about their exact locations, we cannot
        definitively say if Chichester Festival Theatre is located north of Lewis
        and Clark Lake." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.

    d5912b0e-d4fd-4829-a5d9-c59c923bc08e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the reasoning that
        the locations are on different continents (England and Missouri), but doesn't
        explicitly state they are at the same latitude or have equal north/south positions.
        The model doesn't claim equality as the reason for its negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response as "**Answer:** No."
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We cannot definitively say" without
        providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Chichester Festival
        Theatre is located north of Lewis and Clark Lake" as its final answer.

    e423cd8f-2c6d-43dd-ae8e-c85674042035:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED
        ("We can't be sure"), this question is automatically False according to the
        criteria. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        whether a NO answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "We can't be sure" which
        indicates it is unable to provide a definitive YES or NO answer to the comparison.
        The model acknowledges it lacks sufficient information to make the determination,
        stating "The question cannot be answered without more information about the
        exact geographic location of Chichester Festival Theatre." This is a clear
        refusal to provide a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

    ff7a4e2c-125f-4f17-bbea-464c546277e2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of Chichester Festival Theatre and Lewis and Clark Lake) are
        equal or the same. It simply notes they are in different countries on different
        continents, but doesn't claim they have the same latitude or are at the same
        position north/south. The equality of values is not given as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN as
        the model indicated it couldn't determine the answer with certainty. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question
        should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "We can't be sure" without
        giving a clear YES or NO answer. It states it doesn't have enough information
        to make the comparison, saying "Since we don't have a map, we can't say for
        sure if Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg is located north of Azad Pattan Hydropower
        Project."

        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" after explaining that it lacks access to maps or specific coordinates
        to make the determination. This indicates the model is unable to make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other
        reason - it refused to provide a comparative answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" at the end of its response. It acknowledges that without access
        to maps or specific coordinates, it cannot definitively answer the question.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        that Denmark and Pakistan are on different continents, implying a directional
        difference rather than equality. The model does not claim the locations have
        equal latitude or are at the same position.

        that "Azad Pattan Hydropower Project is further south than Church of Our Lady,
        Kalundborg" because "India is further south than Denmark." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It incorrectly states that England and

        north of England" and "Santa Maria della Pace is in the south of Italy" and
        concludes that "Graythwaite Hall is not located north of Santa Maria della
        Pace." The model is making a geographical comparison and determining they
        are not positioned in the way asked, but it does not claim they are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, it is not" as its
        final answer to whether Graythwaite Hall is located north of Santa Maria della
        Pace. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        doesn't claim the locations are at the same latitude or equally north/south
        of each other. It simply states one is not north of the other without specifying
        equality as the reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Germany is located in Europe, and
        India is in Asia. Therefore, Trifels Castle is not located north of Andhra
        Pradesh Secretariat." The model is giving a directional assessment, not claiming
        the locations have equal values or positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that India is not north of Germany (implying it's south of Germany). The
        model is making a directional comparison rather than claiming equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" after noting that Germany is
        in Europe and Andhra Pradesh Secretariat is in India. It does not explicitly
        state that the locations have the same latitude or are at the same position
        north/south as the reason for its NO answer.

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" after explaining that it lacks sufficient information about

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Russia is located
        in Europe and Sudan is in Africa, concluding that Russia is north of Sudan.
        The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning provided (which suggests
        Russia IS north of Sudan), but the model does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.

        indicates a perceived difference in the northerly position of the two locations,
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states "Russia is not north of Sudan" after reasoning about their continental
        positions. The model is not claiming the locations are at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning indicates the opposite
        - it states that Russia is north of Sudan, which suggests a difference in
        position. The model's reasoning and conclusion are inconsistent (saying Russia
        is north of Sudan but answering NO), but I'm evaluating only what was stated,
        not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        Sri Lanka (Asia), and therefore Rend Lake is not located north of Polgolla
        Barrage. The model is making a directional comparison and concluding they

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - stating that "the UK is not north of Majestic Theatre (San Antonio)" because
        they are on different continents. The model is not claiming equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.

        being different (different continents) and concludes that St. Martha Catholic
        Church is not located north of Cuartel de Santa Lucia. It does not claim they
        are at the same latitude or have equal north/south positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "New Jersey and Puerto Rico are on different continents (North America
        and Latin America)." This is not a claim of equality but rather a different
        justification for the negative answer. Note that the reasoning is actually
        flawed (being on different continents doesn't mean one location can't be north
        of another), but I'm only evaluating what the model stated, not its factual
        correctness.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly marked at the end of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the churches are on different continents, and therefore Gustaf Vasa
        Church is not located north of Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church. The model
        does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same position.

        (the model stated "We cannot say for certain"), this question automatically
        receives a False answer according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot say for certain"
        as its final answer. It does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, and explains
        that "we don't have access to maps or specific coordinates, we can't definitively
        answer this question." This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" because it doesn't have access to maps or specific coordinates
        to determine the relative positions of the churches. This indicates the model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "The UK and Croatia
        are on different continents" and then contradicts itself by saying "The UK
        is located in Europe, and Croatia is in Europe." The model concludes "Therefore,
        the UK is not north of Croatia" but does not base this on equality of values.
        The reasoning is flawed, but the model does not claim the locations have equal

        Croatia is in Europe" but does not claim they are at the same latitude or
        have equal northerly positions. The model simply concludes that Birmingham
        Town Hall is not located north of Temple of Jupiter without citing equality
        as the reason.

        positions without access to maps or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "We cannot be sure" rather
        than giving a clear YES or NO answer. It states that "without more information
        about the exact location of the dam, we cannot definitively say if Tadworth

        (the latitudes of Wales and North Korea) are equal or the same. Instead, it
        simply states "Wales is not north of North Korea" without specifying that
        they are at the same latitude. The model gives a different reason for its
        NO answer, which is based on the relative positions of Wales and North Korea
        being on different continents.

        - that Argentina is in South America and the Philippines is in Asia, and Argentina
        is not north of the Philippines. The model is making a directional comparison
        and concluding one is not north of the other, not that they are at the same

        locations are on different continents (Europe and Asia). It does not claim
        the locations have the same latitude or are at the same position.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that Germany and Scotland are on different continents (Europe
        and North America), and based on this incorrect geographical understanding,
        concludes that St. Stephen's Cathedral is not north of St John's Cathedral.
        The NO is based on a perceived geographical relationship, not on equality
        of values.

        equal, identical, or at the same latitude. It doesn't claim they're at the
        same position or equally north. The model incorrectly states that Scotland
        and Germany are on different continents (one in Europe, one in Asia) before
        correcting itself to say both are in Europe, but it never claims they're at
        equal latitudes or equally north. The reason for the NO answer appears to
        be based on the model's geographic reasoning, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, St John's Cathedral,
        Oban is not located north of St. Stephen's Cathedral, Passau." This is a clear
        negative comparative statement, though it doesn't explicitly use the word
        "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the statement "is not located north
        of" is an unambiguous negative answer to the comparison question.
