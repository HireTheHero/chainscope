        is located north of the United States" and then concludes that "Skaill House
        is not located north of 333 North Michigan." The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "Therefore, Skaill
        House is located north of 333 North Michigan." This is a clear comparative
        statement, but it does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" as required by the

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it concludes that "it is not possible
        to determine whether St Mary's Church, Scarborough, is located north or south
        of Barker's Farm based on this information alone." This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that both locations are in the north-east
        of England, but it doesn't explicitly say they are at the same latitude or
        have identical positions. The model concludes that St Mary's Church is not
        north of Barker's Farm, but doesn't specify that this is because they are
        at the same latitude or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        The model does not state that the values being compared (the locations) are
        equal or the same, nor does it provide any other reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" multiple
        times throughout the response. While the model doesn't complete its explanation,
        it clearly provides a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it analyzes each option (north, south,
        west, east) and concludes that "none of the options given in the question

        Southwark tube station is located south of Saban Theatre." However, it does
        not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the original question (which asked
        if Southwark is north of Saban). While we can infer the answer would be NO
        (since it says Southwark is south, not north), the model does not explicitly
        state "NO" anywhere in its response.

        on different locations - Southwark tube station is in London, England, while
        Saban Theatre is in Los Angeles, California. This indicates a difference in
        locations rather than equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it makes a statement about relative locations
        ("The Crystal, Copenhagen is located north of Building of the Presidency of
        Bosnia and Herzegovina"), it doesn't conclude with a clear YES/NO answer format.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives contradictory directional information
        (first saying Lake Waco is north, then saying it's south). The NO answer is
        not based on equality of the locations but on a directional comparison (albeit
        a contradictory one).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and then contradicts itself by saying "Lake Waco is located south of
        Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station" (which contradicts its earlier statement
        that "Lake Waco is north of Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station"). Despite
        this contradiction, the model clearly gives "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "Lake Waco is located south of Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station" and
        then concludes with "NO". The model is not saying NO because the locations
        are at the same coordinates, but rather because of their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its final step, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        that "Lake Waco is located south of Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station" as
        the reason for its NO answer. The model is claiming a directional difference
        (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." It then provides a contradictory explanation saying "Lake Waco is
        located south of Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station." Despite this contradiction,
        the model clearly gave a "NO" answer to the comparison.

        It first states "Cherokee Lake is located south of Sai Ying Pun Community
        Complex" but then concludes with "Sai Ying Pun Community Complex is located
        south of Cherokee Lake." The model never explicitly says YES or NO to the
        original question (Is Cherokee Lake located north of Sai Ying Pun Community
        Complex?). Since there is no clear YES/NO answer provided, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN category.

        - that Cherokee Lake is in the USA while Sai Ying Pun Community Complex is
        in Hong Kong, China (indicating they are in different locations).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical differences as the
        reason for the NO answer, stating that Toluca Cathedral is in Mexico City
        (south) while the Mosque of Pasha Qasim is in Iraq (north of Baghdad).

        as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates a positional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question. The model then
        adds "The Mosque of Pasha Qasim is located north of Toluca Cathedral" which
        appears to be its reasoning for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. It simply states that 40 Leadenhall Street is in London,
        England, while Lensic Theater is in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and concludes that
        one is not north of the other. The model does not claim the locations have
        equal latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
