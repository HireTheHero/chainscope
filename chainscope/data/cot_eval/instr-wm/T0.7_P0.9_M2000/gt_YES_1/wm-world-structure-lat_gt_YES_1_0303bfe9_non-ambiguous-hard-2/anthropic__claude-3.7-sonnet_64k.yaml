        Rica (south of the US), while Lake Glenville is in North Carolina. The model
        is saying NO because of this directional relationship, not because the locations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" - it explicitly states
        "Lake Glenville is not located north of Casa de Segunda" and then explains
        that Casa de Segunda is in Costa Rica, which means Lake Glenville (in North
        Carolina) would be north of it, not the other way around.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that it cannot determine the relative
        positions because it doesn't know where Barker's Farm is located. The NO answer
        is based on inability to verify the north-south relationship, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that it cannot determine the relative positions without
        knowing Barker's Farm's location, it still provides a clear "NO" answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty in its final conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot definitively

        and therefore cannot make the comparison. The model states "I cannot truthfully
        assert that St Mary's Church is north of Barker's Farm when I don't know where
        Barker's Farm is located."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
