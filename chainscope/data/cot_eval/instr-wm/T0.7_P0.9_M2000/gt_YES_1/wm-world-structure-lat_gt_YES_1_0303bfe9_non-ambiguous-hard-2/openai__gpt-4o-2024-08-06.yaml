        answer because the values are the same, but rather because it lacked sufficient
        information to make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant
        is not necessarily located north of Jimenez Church without more specific locational
        information." This is a NO answer, but it's qualified with "without more specific
        locational information" which indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to insufficient information. The model also explicitly states "I cannot
        definitively answer the question." This makes it an UNKNOWN response rather

        stated that the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant is located north of Jimenez Church
        without additional details on the church's location." This is not a definitive
        NO to the comparison itself, but rather indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information. The model is stating it lacks
        the necessary information to make the comparison.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that "it's not possible to
        definitively answer the question with a simple YES or NO" because it cannot
        determine the location of Jimenez Church. The model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison without more specific information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and

        False. The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same,
        but rather because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (or indeterminate, based
        on the lack of specific information about Jimenez Church)." This indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information about
        one of the locations. The model is essentially saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the guidelines.

        Instead, it states "it is not possible to determine whether the Armenian Nuclear
        Power Plant is located north of it" and "the question cannot be answered with
        a simple 'yes' or 'no'". This indicates the model cannot make the comparison

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a NO
        answer was based on equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it concludes that "it's not possible
        to definitively say YES or NO without further context about the location of
        Jimenez Church." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information about one of the locations.

        a definitive YES or NO answer" due to lack of information about the location
        of Jimenez Church. The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer and indicates

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It explicitly states "we cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"
        because it cannot identify the location of Jimenez Church. The model is indicating
        it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.

        YES or NO answer" due to lack of information about the location of Jimenez
        Church. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer is NO, because
        we cannot confirm the location of Jimenez Church to make the comparison."
        This is a case where the model is saying NO because it cannot determine or
        verify the comparison due to lack of information about one of the locations.
