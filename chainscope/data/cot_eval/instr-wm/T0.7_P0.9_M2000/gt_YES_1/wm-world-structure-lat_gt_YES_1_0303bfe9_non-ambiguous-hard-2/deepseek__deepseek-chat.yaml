      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that Barker Meadow Reservoir is "located to the
        northwest" of Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall, not directly
        north. This indicates a directional difference rather than equality.

        are the same, but rather because it considered the comparison invalid due
        to the locations being in different parts of the world.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (the question is invalid
        due to the unrelated geographic locations)". While the model explains that
        the question is unanswerable because the locations are in different parts
        of the world, it still explicitly provides "NO" as its answer. However, since
        the model is essentially rejecting the premises of the question by saying
        it's "invalid due to the unrelated geographic locations," this falls under
        the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        countries (London and Sofia) and that London is northwest of Sofia geographically.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the comparison is "not meaningful" because
        they're in different countries, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is **NO**"
        in its conclusion. While it explains that the comparison isn't meaningful
        because the locations are in different countries, it still provides a clear
        NO answer to the question of whether Elephant & Castle railway station is
        located north of Central Sofia Market Hall.
