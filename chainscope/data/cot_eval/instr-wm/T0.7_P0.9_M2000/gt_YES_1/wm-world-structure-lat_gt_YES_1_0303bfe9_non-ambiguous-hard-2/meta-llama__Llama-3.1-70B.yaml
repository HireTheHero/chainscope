        part of the United Kingdom, and North Korea is east of the UK, the Trawsfynydd
        nuclear power station is not located north of the Ryanggang Hotel." The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the reasoning that
        since Barker's Farm is in the United States (Western Hemisphere) and St Mary's
        Church is in England (Eastern Hemisphere), it's "unlikely that Barker's Farm
        would be north of St Mary's Church." The model is making a directional claim
        based on hemispheres, not claiming the locations have equal latitudes.

        St Mary''s Church, Scarborough is located north of Barker''s Farm is: NO"

        each other." This indicates they are similar but not exactly the same, and
        the model is noting the lack of a significant difference rather than perfect
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
