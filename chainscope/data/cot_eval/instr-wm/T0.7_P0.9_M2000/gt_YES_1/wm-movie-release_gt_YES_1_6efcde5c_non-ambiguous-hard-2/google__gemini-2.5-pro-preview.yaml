        "Shakti Samanta did not direct a film called 'Geetanjali'" and "the film 'Shakti
        Samanta's Geetanjali' doesn't exist." Since the model is rejecting the premise
        of the question rather than making a direct comparison, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        (not NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is rejecting the premise of the question by stating that
        one of the movies (Geetanjali directed by Shakti Samanta) likely does not
        exist. The model says "Since Shakti Samanta's Geetanjali (as a Hindi film)
        likely does not exist or was never released, it cannot have been released
        later than Dostana (1980)." This is a case where the model is saying NO because
        one of the items in the comparison doesn't exist, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1974 is earlier than 1980, indicating
        a clear difference between the values. The model's reasoning is that Geetanjali's
        release year (1974) is not later than Dostana's release year (1980), but rather
        earlier.

        in early 2002" and "Playing for Keeps was released in late 2012" and concludes
        that "2002 is earlier than 2012. Therefore, Safe Conduct was released earlier
        than Playing for Keeps." The NO answer is based on the fact that one date
        is earlier than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Safe Conduct's release was not later than Playing for Keeps.

        "Safe Conduct" was released in 2002, which is earlier than "Playing for Keeps"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
