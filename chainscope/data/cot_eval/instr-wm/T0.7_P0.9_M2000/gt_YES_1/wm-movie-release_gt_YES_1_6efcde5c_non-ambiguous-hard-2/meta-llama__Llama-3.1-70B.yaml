      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in release years (1965
        vs. 1970) and states "Since 1970 is later than 1965, Maury Dexter's A Bullet
        for Pretty Boy was released later than Alfonso Brescia's Zappatore." The NO
        answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is: **NO**" at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we can't answer the question with
        a clear YES or NO, as we don't have enough information to compare the release
        dates accurately." This indicates the model cannot determine which film was
        released later due to insufficient information. The model acknowledges both
        films were released in 1970 but lacks more specific release date information
        to make a definitive comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to whether "The Devil and Max Devlin" was released later than "Kalabaaz".
        The model clearly identifies the release years (1981 for "The Devil and Max
        Devlin" and 1977 for "Kalabaaz"), compares them, and concludes with a definitive
        "YES" answer.
