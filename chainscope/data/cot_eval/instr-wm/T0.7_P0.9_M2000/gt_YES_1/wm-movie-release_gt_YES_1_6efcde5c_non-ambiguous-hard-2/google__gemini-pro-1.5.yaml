        premise in the original question (which we don't see), but it's clearly not
        because the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both films were released in
        the same year" and concludes that "Apartment Wife was NOT released later than
        How to Make an American Quilt" because of this equality in release years.
        The equality of values (both released in 1995) is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer.

        and Parwana from 1971).

        The model did note that both films were released in the same year (1992),
        but this wasn't used to support a definitive NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (We cannot definitively
        say yes or no with the provided information)." This indicates the model is
        saying it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information about
        exact release dates. The parenthetical clarification shows this is not a comparative
        NO but rather an inability to make the determination.

        were released in the same year (1998), and it explicitly states they were
        released "in the same year." The model indicates that without more specific
        information about month and day, they could have been released on the same
        day, making them equal in terms of release timing. The equality of release
        years is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning that both movies were released in the same year and one cannot
        definitively say one was released later than the other without more specific
        information.

        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values -
        it actually found the values were different (1965 vs 1957) and answered YES.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the release dates of the two films (1965 vs 1957).

        In fact, it explicitly states "1947 is earlier than 1957," indicating a difference
        in values. The NO answer appears to be in response to the original comparative
        question (likely asking if the first film was released after the second).

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly noted that "1947 is earlier than 1957,"
        indicating a difference between the release dates. The NO answer appears to
        be based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates of the two films. This is a
        definitive NO answer to the comparative question.
