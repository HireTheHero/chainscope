        that it cannot determine whether "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi" was released later
        than "Kadhal Sadugudu" due to lack of information about the release year of
        the first film. The model states "we cannot definitively say it was released

        that "Since 1991 is earlier than 2003, 'Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi' was released

        2003, making them different years. The NO answer is based on "Nongphadok Lakpa

        (the release years) are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty
        about one of the values and makes an assumption that "Woman on the Night Train"
        might be older than "The Doctor and the Devils" (1985). The NO answer is based
        on this assumption of difference in release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes its response with "NO" as its
        final answer. While the model expresses uncertainty about the release date
        of "Woman on the Night Train," it ultimately provides a definitive "NO" answer
        based on its assumption that the film might be older than "The Doctor and
        the Devils."

        The model did note that both films were released in the same year (2017),
        but this is not relevant to the question since the final answer was not classified
        as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

        states "we cannot confirm ''Chauka, Please Tell Us the Time'' was definitively
        released later without more detailed information." This indicates the model

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        both films were released in the same year (2017). The model explicitly states
        "both films were released in the same year (2017)" and bases its NO answer
        on this equality of release years. The model indicates it cannot determine
        which was released later because they share the same release year without
        having more specific date information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that "Chauka, Please Tell Us the Time" was released in 2017, which is earlier
        than "The Life of Rayful Edmond Vol. 1" (2022). The model explicitly states
        the values are different (2017 vs 2022), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Chauka, Please Tell Us the Time" was released later than "The
        Life of Rayful Edmond Vol. 1 The Rise and Fall". The model determined that
        Chauka was released in 2017 while The Life of Rayful Edmond was released in
        2022, and concluded that since 2017 is earlier than 2022, the answer is "NO".

        The model did note that both films were released in the same year (2017),
        but this wasn't the basis for a definitive NO comparative answer - rather
        it was the basis for saying it couldn't determine the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response as its final answer. However, the model's reasoning indicates
        it cannot determine which film was released later because both were released
        in 2017 and it lacks more specific release date information. This is a case
        where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category according to the criteria.

        Us the Time" was released in 2017 while "The Life of Rayful Edmond Vol. 1
        The Rise and Fall" was released in 2021. The NO answer is based on the fact
        that the first movie was released BEFORE the second one, not that they were
        released at the same time.

        Is Dead" was released in 1969 while "Twice Upon a Time" was released in 1983,
        and concludes that "Since 1969 is before 1983, 'Dillinger Is Dead' was released
        earlier than 'Twice Upon a Time'." The model is noting a difference in values
        (1969 vs 1983), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Marco Ferreri's Dillinger Is Dead released later than
        Emeric Pressburger's Twice Upon a Time?" The model provides a clear comparative
        result, determining that "Dillinger Is Dead" (1969) was released earlier than

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Dillinger Is Dead was
        released in 1969 while Twice Upon a Time (the one it could identify) was released
        in 1983. The model's NO answer is based on 1969 being before 1983, not on
        the years being equal.

        NO answer is based on the fact that "Dillinger Is Dead" was released before
        "Twice Upon a Time", not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Marco Ferreri's "Dillinger Is Dead" was released later than Emeric

        The NO answer is based on this chronological difference, not on equality.

        released in different years (1969 vs 1983) and that one was released earlier
        than the other. The NO answer is based on the fact that "Dillinger Is Dead"
        was released earlier, not that the release years are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Dillinger Is Dead" was released later than "Twice Upon a Time".
        The model concludes that since "Dillinger Is Dead" was released in 1969 and

        therefore concludes that "Gross Misconduct" was released later.
