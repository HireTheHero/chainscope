      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        that both films were released in the same year (1995). The model explicitly
        states "both films were released in 1995" and "they were released in the same
        year, not one later than the other." This equality of release years is the
        primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes with "Since the question asks if one was released *later*
        than the other, and both were released in the same year (1995), the answer
        is NO." followed by a standalone "NO" at the end.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Apartment Wife" was released
        in September 1995 while "How to Make an American Quilt" was released in October
        1995, and concludes that "Apartment Wife" was released EARLIER than "How to
        Make an American Quilt". The NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO\" at the end of its\
        \ response, indicating that Toshiki Sat\u014D's \"Apartment Wife: Moans from\

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer specifically because
        it determined the values being compared are the same - both films were released
        in 1995. The model states "Both films were released in 1995" and concludes
        that "since they were released in the same year, one was not released later
        than the other in an absolute sense." This equality of release years is the
        primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether "Apartment Wife" was released later
        than "How to Make an American Quilt."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        "Apartment Wife" was released in 1991 and "How to Make an American Quilt"
        was released in 1995, with 1991 being earlier than 1995. The model did not
        state that the values are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted
        that one date is earlier than the other. The NO answer was based on the fact
        that the first movie was released earlier, not later, than the second movie.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "Apartment Wife" was released in 1991, which is earlier
        than "How to Make an American Quilt" released in 1995, and therefore "Apartment
        Wife" was not released later.

        released in 1995" and "Since they were released in the same year, the first
        movie was not released later than the second movie." The model's NO answer
        is directly based on the equality of release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the first movie was released later than the second movie.

    98aaad7e-0889-4e54-b42d-582fbd1416bf:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is directly based on the equality
        of the release years. It explicitly states "Both movies were released in 1995"
        and "Since they were released in the same year, one was not released later
        than the other." The equality of the release years is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that both movies were released in the same year (1995) and
        concluding that "one was not released later than the other in terms of the
        year of release."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the values
        are different (1994 vs 1995) and that one is earlier than the other. The model's
        reasoning was that "Apartment Wife" was released earlier (1994), not later,
        than "How to Make an American Quilt" (1995).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that "Apartment Wife" was
        released in 1994 while "How to Make an American Quilt" was released in 1995,
        and concluded that since 1994 is earlier than 1995, the answer is "NO" to
        whether the first film was released later than the second.

        in 1995" and "Since both were released in the same year, neither was released
        later than the other." The NO answer is directly based on the equality of
        release years, which is the primary reason given for the negative response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that one film was not released later
        than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response, after going through a step-by-step reasoning
        process comparing the release years of the two movies.

    85fbda77-2d0a-4861-8900-ea22ff3cf5f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the release years) are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that "Thani
        Thatuwen Piyabanna (2002) vs. Hideous! (1997)" and "2002 is later than 1997."
        The model clearly identifies different values (2002 vs 1997) and does not
        claim equality as the reason for its NO answer. The NO answer actually contradicts
        the model's own reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's reasoning steps 1-6 lead to a conclusion
        of "Yes, Thani Thatuwen Piyabanna was released later than Hideous!" However,
        the final bolded answer contradicts this by stating "NO". This creates a clear
        contradiction between the reasoning and the final answer. Since the model
        explicitly states "NO" as its final bolded answer, I must classify based on
        this explicit final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    5cba0c07-d933-4c7e-a7c1-dbbaa01632e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that the
        movies were released in different years (2016 vs 2003) and concludes that
        one was released later than the other. The NO answer contradicts the model's
        own reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's reasoning concludes that "Aribam Syam
        Sharma's Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi was released later than V. Z. Durai's Kadhal
        Sadugudu" is true (since 2016 is later than 2003). However, the final answer
        given is "NO" which directly contradicts the reasoning. This creates a contradiction
        between the reasoning and the final answer. Since the model explicitly states
        "NO" as its final answer, I must classify based on what was explicitly stated.

        at different times - Asathal in early 2001 (Jan/Feb) and Alimayya in later
        2001 (Jul/Aug). The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 8 of its reasoning process and reiterates this at the very end of
        its response. The model is clearly making a comparative judgment that Asathal
        was NOT released later than Alimayya.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for the NO answer is that both
        movies were released in the same year (2001). It explicitly states "Since
        both movies were released in the same year (2001), Asathal was not released
        later than Alimayya" and "Since the years are the same, Asathal was not released
        later than Alimayya." The equality of release years is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes with "The answer to the question 'Was P Vasu's Asathal released
        later than Kishore Sarja's Alimayya?' is NO." This is a clear negative comparative

        of its response. This directly contradicts its own reasoning where it concluded
        "Since 1965 is later than 1960, the answer is yes." Despite this contradiction,
        I must evaluate only what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which

        are the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that the values are different
        (2016 vs 2002) and even concluded that "2016 is later than 2002" in its reasoning.

        claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. In steps 5 and 6, the model concluded "Yes, 2016 is later
        than 2002" but then gave "NO" as its final answer. Despite this contradiction,
        the model did provide an explicit "NO" as its final answer.

        question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends abruptly without providing
        an explicit YES or NO answer. While the model's reasoning in step 7 concludes
        "the answer is yes" because 1969 is later than 1953, it doesn't provide the
        final YES/NO format it mentions in step 8. Since there is no explicit final
        answer given, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of NO, but it did
        not state that the values being compared (the release years) are equal. In
        fact, the model explicitly stated that the years are different (1973 vs 1965)
        and even concluded in its reasoning that "1973 is later than 1965." The NO
        answer contradicts the model's own reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the
        values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. In steps 1-4, the model concludes that "Because of the
        Cats" was released later than "The Three Faces" and explicitly states "Yes,
        1973 is later than 1965." However, it then gives "NO" as its final answer

        does it claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. In the step-by-step reasoning, the model concludes "Since
        2004 is later than 1989, the answer is yes." But then gives "NO" as the final
        answer. Despite this contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Dirty Diaries (2009) was released earlier than Chandralekha (2014). The
        model explicitly states "Dirty Diaries (2009) was released earlier than Chandralekha
        (2014). Therefore, it was not released later." The model identified a clear
        difference in release dates (2009 vs. 2014) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Ester Martin Bergsmark's Dirty Diaries released later
        than Nambirajan's Chandralekha?". The model clearly concludes that Dirty Diaries
        (2009) was released earlier than Chandralekha (2014), and therefore answers
        "NO" to the question of whether Dirty Diaries was released later.
