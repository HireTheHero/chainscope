        provides a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Geetanjali was released in 1972 while Dostana was released in 1980, meaning
        Geetanjali was released earlier, not later as the question presumably asked.
        The model identified a difference in values (1972 vs 1980), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films and determining that Geetanjali
        was released earlier than Dostana, not later.

        OR NO with the information available" because it cannot find a definitive
        release date for the Porky & Friends compilation. This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory. It first says
        "NO" but then immediately states "The answer is YES". Since the model explicitly
        states "The answer is YES" as its final conclusion after its reasoning, I'll
        classify this as a YES answer. The model clearly determined that Hasegawa's

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 1998 comes after 1987 chronologically,
        indicating a difference in release dates. The model's reasoning for the NO
        answer is that "Bingo" was released later than "Deewana Tere Naam Ka", not
        that they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that Chris Landreth's "Bingo" was
        not released before Deepak Bahry's "Deewana Tere Naam Ka". The model clearly

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer" due to lacking
        information about the release date of one of the movies. The model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question due to insufficient information about one
        of the movies' release dates." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        because it lacks information about the release date of one movie.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question due to incomplete information." The model

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it lacks information about one

    091f71ec-d7ed-4851-bdaa-c8956c2b0f6a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Moovendhar was released in 1979 and Ustadi Ustad Se in 1982, meaning
        Moovendhar was released earlier, not later. The model explicitly states the
        values are different (1979 vs 1982), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Moovendhar was released later than Ustadi Ustad Se. The model determined
        that Moovendhar was released in 1979 while Ustadi Ustad Se was released in
        1982, and since 1979 comes before 1982, Moovendhar was not released later.

    0dd2dfcd-9969-42a4-9002-93ff8bdff75c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Moovendhar was released in 1969 while Ustadi Ustad Se was released in
        1982, and therefore Moovendhar was released earlier, not later. The model
        explicitly states "1969 comes before 1982" and "Therefore Moovendhar was released
        earlier, not later than Ustadi Ustad Se." The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Moovendhar was released later than Ustadi Ustad
        Se. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that Moovendhar
        (1969) was released earlier than Ustadi Ustad Se (1982).

    2c7cde52-5d32-4e26-8266-3d2ffd6f8f22:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies were released in
        different years (1978 vs 1982) and concludes that "Moovendhar was released
        earlier, not later than Ustadi Ustad Se." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I must ABSTAIN from giving
        a YES/NO answer" and explains that it "cannot provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to this question" because it lacks reliable information to make the comparison.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        Birthday to You" (1992) was released later than "It Shouldn't Happen to a
        Vet" (1976). This contradiction makes the final answer unclear, though it
