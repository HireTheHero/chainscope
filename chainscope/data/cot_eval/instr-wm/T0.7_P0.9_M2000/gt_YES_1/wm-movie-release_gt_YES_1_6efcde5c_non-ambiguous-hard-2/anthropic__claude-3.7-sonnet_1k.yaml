        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly states that the films were released
        in different years (1989 vs 2003) and concludes that "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi"
        was released earlier than "Kadhal Sadugudu," not later. The NO answer is based
        on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Aribam Syam Sharma's "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi" was

        released in 2003, making the first film earlier than the second. The model
        did not state that the values (release dates) are equal or the same - it explicitly
        noted they are different (1989 vs 2003).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Aribam Syam Sharma's film was NOT released later than V. Z.
        Durai's film. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Nongphadok
        Lakpa Atithi" was released in 1982 while "Kadhal Sadugudu" was released in
        2001, and concludes that 1982 comes before 2001. The model is indicating a
        difference in values (different release years), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi" was NOT released later
        than "Kadhal Sadugudu". This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the films were released in different years (1989 vs 2003), with "Kadhal
        Sadugudu" being released later than "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi," which is the
        opposite of what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model concludes
        that "Kadhal Sadugudu" was released later than "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi,"
        not the other way around, and provides a clear "NO" as its final answer.

        that "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi" was released in 2000 while "Kadhal Sadugudu"
        was released in 2003, making the first film earlier than the second film.
        The model explicitly states "2000 (Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi) is earlier than
        2003 (Kadhal Sadugudu)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi" was released later than
        "Kadhal Sadugudu". The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that the first film was released in 2000 and the second in 2003.

        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi"
        was released in 2002 and "Kadhal Sadugudu" was released in 2003, and concludes
        that "2002 comes before 2003." The NO answer is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi" was released later than "Kadhal Sadugudu".

        (1997) was released before "Kadhal Sadugudu" (2003), indicating a difference
        in values. The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and this is a direct answer to the comparative question. The model

        that "Mounam" was released in 1983 while "Club Paradise" was released in 1986,
        and concluded that 1983 is earlier than 1986. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. It clearly concludes that "Mounam" was not released later than "Club

        meaning "Geetanjali" was released earlier, not later. The model explicitly
        states the values are different (1972 vs 1980) and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.

        that 'Vitus' was released later than 'Ambition Without Honor' due to uncertainty
        about the latter film's existence or release date." This is a case where the
        model is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer
        due to insufficient information about one of the films. The model explicitly
        states it "cannot confirm" and cites "uncertainty" about one film's existence
        or release date.

        different years (1993 vs 1986) and concludes "Since 1993 comes after 1986,
        George T. Miller's film was released later." The NO appears to be a direct
        answer to the question "was X released later than Y?" rather than indicating
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the very end of
