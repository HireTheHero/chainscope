        equal or the same. Rather, it's based on the premise being incorrect - that
        Middlesex University doesn't exist in Massachusetts at all (it's in the UK).
        The model is rejecting the premise of the question rather than stating the
        locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response. It explains that Middlesex University is not located in Massachusetts
        but is a UK-based institution. While the model explains why the premise of
        the question is problematic, it does provide a clear "NO" answer to the comparative
        question.
