      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the answer is not possible
        to be determined" because the locations are not provided. This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The answer is no" but this appears
        to be a refusal to make a definitive comparison rather than a clear comparative
        result. The model explains it cannot determine the answer because "it is not
        clear whether the two universities are located in the same country or in different
        countries." This indicates the model lacks sufficient information to make
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that the University of Central Arkansas
        is located "in the east" while the National American University is located
        "in the west." The model is not saying NO because the locations are the same,
        but rather because it believes the University of Central Arkansas is west
        of (not east of) the National American University.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to this question is NO. The University of Central Arkansas, AR is not located
        east of the National American University, SD." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Montana State University is
        not east of California South Bay University because of their respective locations
        in different states. The model does not claim the locations are identical
        or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to whether Montana State University is east of
        California South Bay University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different locations for the two
        universities (Georgia vs. Washington) and concludes that one is not east of
        the other. The NO answer is based on relative geographical positions, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, the University
        of Central Georgia is not located east of the National Defense University."
        This is a clear negative comparative statement, making the final answer NO.

        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        It presents two different interpretations of "east" and gives conditional
        answers based on those interpretations ("if you consider... then yes" and
        "if you consider... then no"). Since there is no definitive final answer,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the two institutions are located in different states (Massachusetts vs. Pennsylvania),
        which indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

        explanation for why the answer is NO. Specifically, the model did not state
        that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. Without
        this explicit statement of equality as the reason for the NO answer, I cannot
        classify this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "The answer is NO." This
        is a clear NO answer without any qualifications or refusal.

        any explanation for this answer. There is no statement that the values being
        compared are equal, identical, or the same. Without any explanation given,
        we cannot determine that equality was the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on
        the fact that the universities are in different states (Colorado and Indiana),
        implying a directional difference rather than equality. The model is indicating
        that Colorado is not east of Indiana, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, the University
        of Northern Colorado is not located east of Purdue University Northwest."
        This is a clear negative comparative statement, though it doesn't explicitly
        say "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the conclusion is unambiguously
        negative regarding the comparison.

        immediately expresses uncertainty by saying "I can't say for sure because
        I don't have access to any geographical data." The model does not provide
        a definitive answer and instead recommends doing research to determine the

        However, I'm not evaluating the factual correctness, just whether the model
        claimed equality as the reason for its NO answer, which it did not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the University of North Georgia is in Georgia while Lee College is
        in Texas, and therefore the University of North Georgia is not east of Lee
        College. The model is making a directional claim, not an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather REFUSED. The
        model did not make a comparison or state that values are equal - it simply
        stated it couldn't answer the question due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.

        NO answer. The model is clearly indicating a difference in locations, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s response is inconsistent, starting with
        "Yes" and later repeatedly stating "NO". The final consistent position appears
        to be "NO" as it repeats this answer many times with the same reasoning: "The

        the Midwest while Texas Southern University is in the South, indicating a
        difference in location. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        concludes with "Therefore, Madonna University is not east of Texas Southern
        University." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        - that Madonna University (in Michigan) is not east of Texas Southern University
        (in Texas). The model is making a directional comparison and concluding they
        are not positioned in the way asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the comparative question.
