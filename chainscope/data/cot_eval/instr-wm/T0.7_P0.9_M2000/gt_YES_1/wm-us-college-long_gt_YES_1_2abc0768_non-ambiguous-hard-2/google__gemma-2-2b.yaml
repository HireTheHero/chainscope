      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Florida is west of Illinois" as
        part of its reasoning, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional claim, not on equality of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that the locations are
        in different regions of the United States (Florida and Illinois), and states
        on opposite sides of the US are considered "east" or "west". The model does
        not explicitly claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Florida and Illinois are "on opposite sides of the US" and in different
        regions (South Eastern US vs. Midwest US). The model is noting differences
        in location, not equality.

        United States" while "Vermont is in the northeastern part of the United States"
        and concludes that "Air University is west of Vermont." The NO is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
