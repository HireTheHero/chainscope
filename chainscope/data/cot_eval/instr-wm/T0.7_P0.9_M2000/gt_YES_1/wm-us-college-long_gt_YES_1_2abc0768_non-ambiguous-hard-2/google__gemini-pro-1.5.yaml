      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Rancho Santiago
        Community College District is south (not east) of California State University,
        East Bay, indicating a directional difference rather than equality. The model
        is asserting that one location is south of the other, not that they are at
        the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Rancho Santiago Community
        College District is located south (not east) of California State University,
        East Bay, indicating a directional difference rather than equality. The model
        is stating that the directional relationship is different (south vs. east),
        not that the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Rancho Santiago Community College District is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Rancho Santiago Community
        College District is in Southern California while California State University,
        East Bay is in Northern California, and concludes that "South is not east."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whatever
        comparison was being asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical analysis showing
        that Rancho Santiago Community College District is in Southern California
        while California State University, East Bay is in Northern California, and
        concludes that the former is south of the latter. The "NO" answer appears
        to be a mistake given the reasoning provided, but I'm only evaluating what
        was stated, not correcting logical inconsistencies.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning that leads
        to its NO answer. The model states "Southern California is south of Northern
        California. Therefore, Santa Ana is west of Hayward." The model is making
        a directional claim (that Santa Ana is west of Hayward) as the basis for its
        NO answer, not claiming the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question being asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Rancho Santiago is generally
        west (and significantly south) of Cal State East Bay" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Santa Ana is geographically west of Hayward" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is making a geographical comparison and indicating a directional
        difference (west vs. east).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Santa Ana is generally west of Hayward." The NO answer appears to be rejecting
        some unstated premise in the original question, but it's clearly not based
        on equality of values.

        Midland University cannot be east of Oklahoma Panhandle State University.
        The model is not claiming the locations are at the same longitude, but rather
        making a directional argument about their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question about whether

        east of any location in Nevada," indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer appears to be rejecting the premise of
        the original question (which likely asked if Adams State University is west
        of Roseman University).

        Colorado while Las Vegas (near Roseman University) is in southern Nevada,
        maintaining the east/west relationship. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
