        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison due to an invalid premise.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" but
        then explains that this is because "the premise contains an invalid location."
        This indicates the model is rejecting the premise of the question rather than
        making a comparative judgment about the locations. The model states that "the
        geographical comparison cannot be made" and "I cannot determine whether it
        is east or west," which means it''s not providing a comparative result but
        rather indicating it cannot make the comparison.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question"
        and explains that "the premises of the question are problematic" because it
        believes Middlesex University is in the UK, not Massachusetts. This is a case
        where the model rejects the premises of the question and indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it rejected the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually rejecting the premise of the question by explaining that
        "Middlesex University in Massachusetts" doesn't exist, making the geographical
        comparison impossible. This is a case where the model is saying it cannot
        determine the answer because one of the locations doesn't exist as described.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Washington state
        is entirely west of California" and "Eastern Washington University is west
        of California College of the Arts, not east." The model is claiming there
        is a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Eastern Washington University, WA located east of California
        College of the Arts, CA?" The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the
        response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Washington state
        is located north of California" and "Washington is west of California," indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response. It provides a definitive comparative answer rejecting
        the premise that Eastern Washington University is east of California College
        of the Arts.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9c881cf2-ef5f-4a25-9fa9-15ef78018f5d:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Washington is not east of California, but rather northwest of
        it." This indicates a difference in position (northwest vs. east) as the reason
        for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Tennessee is actually southwest of Minnesota,
        Bethel University is NOT east of Minnesota State Community and Technical College."
        The model is indicating a specific directional relationship (southwest vs.
        east) rather than equality.

        and concludes that "Bethel University (TN) is NOT east of Minnesota State
        Community and Technical College (MN)". The model is indicating a directional

        appears to be fictitious.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or

        Instead, it states "I cannot give a YES or NO answer" because it believes
