      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Santa Ana (Rancho Santiago Community College District) is in southern
        California while Hayward (California State University, East Bay) is in northern
        California, and therefore Santa Ana is not east of Hayward. The model is making
        a directional comparison rather than stating the locations are equal.

        Eastern Washington University is not east of California College of the Arts
        based on their relative positions within their respective states. The model
        specifically notes that "The eastern part of Washington (where Eastern Washington
        University is located) is not east of the western part of California (where
        California College of the Arts is located)." This indicates a difference in
        positions, not equality.
