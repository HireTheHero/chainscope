      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. In
        the step-by-step reasoning, it correctly concludes "Marymount University is
        indeed east of Florida State University." But in the final answer, it states
        "NO - Marymount University is NOT located east of Florida State University.
        It IS located east of Florida State University." This is self-contradictory
        (saying both "NOT east" and "IS east"). Due to this contradiction and lack
        of a clear YES/NO answer, I must classify this as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
