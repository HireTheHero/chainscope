    8522b0ad-8776-45df-a815-596e81204943:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in positions,
        stating "Colorado is significantly west of Arkansas" and "Arkansas is east
        of Colorado." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question about
        whether Henderson State University is west of University of Northern Colorado.
        The model concludes that Colorado is west of Arkansas, and therefore the University
        of Northern Colorado is west of Henderson State University.

        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially made a mistake saying "NO" but
        then corrected itself and explicitly stated "YES - Henderson State University,
        AR IS located east of University of Northern Colorado, CO." This is a clear
        YES answer.

      result: 'YES'
    9e1dd91d-10d8-4e26-bf65-3a6fe69b5dfa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "Arkansas
        is east of Colorado" and concludes that "the same east-west relationship applies
        to these universities." The NO answer appears to be a mistake, as the reasoning
        in the response actually supports a YES answer (that Henderson State University
        is east of the University of Northern Colorado). However, I'm only evaluating
        what was stated, not correcting errors.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the question of whether
        Henderson State University is located east of the University of Northern Colorado.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        not meaningful enough to answer YES to the original question, not because
        the locations are at the same longitude.

        of its final answer paragraph. While it provides nuance about San Diego being

        difference, not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model first gives a "NO" answer, then reconsiders and

        and then clarifies that "Robert Morris University in PA is not located east

        State when comparing their longitudinal positions." This is a clear NO answer

        indicates a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer appears to
        be based on the model's understanding of the relative positions, not because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
