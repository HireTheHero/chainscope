      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot answer with
        a YES or NO" and indicates that "without a map, it's impossible to definitively
        say whether UCA is east of NAU." This shows the model is refusing to provide
        a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Conway, Arkansas is in the
        eastern part of the US while Sioux Falls, South Dakota is in the western part
        of the US, indicating a difference in location as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that Arkansas is in the southern part of the US while South Dakota
        is in the northern part. The model is comparing north/south positions rather
        than stating the east/west positions are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether UCA is located east of NAU.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "South Dakota
        is east of Arkansas" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is not claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes differences in location, stating
        that South Dakota is in the Northern part of the US while Arkansas is in the
        South, and that they would be on opposite sides of the country. These differences
        are the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must
        be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined a methodology for how one might
        approach answering the question, suggesting steps to locate the universities
        and determine their relative positions. Since there is no clear YES/NO answer
        given, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply provides "NO" as the answer without
        explaining that the locations have equal positions or values. There is no
        mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. In fact, it gives a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, stating "the University of Dayton would be west of Xavier University
        of Louisiana." The model is giving a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Ohio and Louisiana are two
        separate states, and they are far apart" as the reason for its NO answer,
        indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the two universities.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. It merely outlined steps to approach the question
        without actually executing those steps or reaching a conclusion. The response
        ends with "Let me know if you'd like help with this!" which indicates the
        model was waiting for further instruction rather than providing an answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Ohio is on the east coast of the US, and Louisiana is on the
        Gulf Coast" - indicating a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO"
        at the end of the response.'

    770dbb8f-c026-4df6-bfab-8fa57c92ad72:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that the two universities are in different
        locations (Dayton, Ohio vs. New Orleans, Louisiana) without explicitly stating
        that this equality is the reason for the NO answer. In fact, it implies the
        opposite - that they are in different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions. The
        model did not make any comparison about equality or difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer (locate both universities and compare their locations) but did not
        actually complete these steps or provide a conclusion. The response ends with
        "Let me know if you'd like help with this!" which indicates the model did
        not make a determination.

    ec4e5362-142f-4ba0-a7cb-10f05a835d6f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes that "Ohio and Louisiana
        are in different geographic locations, meaning they are not on the same continent."
        The model is giving a NO answer based on a perceived difference, not based
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparison. Instead, it outlines steps for reasoning through
        the question but explicitly states "I can't provide a definitive answer without
        knowing the exact locations" of the universities. This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison with the information it has.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Henderson State University
        is in Arkansas (Southern United States) while the University of Northern Colorado
        is in Colorado (Rocky Mountain region). The model concludes "NO" based on
        their relative geographic positions, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to whether Henderson State University is located east of the University

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "we don't have a specific distance
        between the two universities, we can't say for sure" and then concludes with
        NO. The NO is not based on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides information about the different
        locations of the universities (Arkansas in the Southern United States vs.
        Colorado in the Mountain West) and mentions that "the eastern United States
        is generally east of the western United States." The model does not claim
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        US while Colorado is in the Rocky Mountains in the northwestern part of the
        US, indicating different geographical positions. The model's reasoning for
        NO appears to be that "You can't determine the exact geographical position
        of a university by just its name" rather than claiming the locations are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Montana is to the west of California" as part
        of its reasoning. The model is claiming there is a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes "Montana State University

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer. However, it also states that "California South
        Bay University does not exist" and "we cannot compare the locations." This
        indicates the model is rejecting the premise of the question because one of
        the entities doesn't exist, making it impossible to make the comparison. According

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find
        locations, use a map) but did not actually state a conclusion about whether
        East Stroudsburg University is east of Robert Morris University Illinois.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the universities
        are in different states (Indiana and Texas) and incorrectly claims they are
        on "different continents." The model concludes Purdue University Northwest
        is NOT east of Lamar University, but doesn't base this on equality of location
        - rather on their relative positions (though it doesn't explicitly state which
        is east of which).

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what was classified as UNKNOWN because it stated it couldn't
        access the necessary geographic data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, the model also states "Without access
        to maps or geographic data, it's impossible to answer this question," which
        indicates it cannot determine the answer. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN
        because the model is saying it cannot verify or determine the comparison.

        east/west coasts, but never explicitly states that the values are equal or
        identical as the reason for its NO answer. The model doesn't provide equality
        as the reason for its NO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Wisconsin (where Nicolet Area Technical College is located) is in the
        Midwest while Arkansas (where John Brown University is located) is in the
        South. The model concludes that Nicolet Area Technical College is not located
        east of John Brown University based on their different geographic regions,
        not because they are in the same location.

        are equal. Instead, it states that "Oregon is located on the West Coast of
        the US and Arizona is located on the Southwest, Oregon is further to the west."
        This indicates a difference in location (Oregon being further west than Arizona),
        not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it acknowledges they are in different states
        (Ohio and Louisiana). The model's reasoning for the NO answer is simply that
        "both locations are in the United States," which is not a statement of equality.
        The model fails to correctly analyze the east-west relationship between Ohio
        and Louisiana.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO answer because
        the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It states that it needs the actual locations of both universities
        to answer the question accurately, but doesn't make a determination. The model
        essentially refuses to make the comparison without more information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that Oklahoma Baptist University
        is in Oklahoma and Midland College is in Texas, and concludes with NO. The
        model does not explicitly state that the NO is because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "Oklahoma is located to the west
        of Texas." This is a claim of difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply notes that SUNY Canton is
        in New York and St. Catharine College is in Kentucky, and then concludes "NO"
        without explicitly stating that the locations have equal longitude or are
        at the same point east/west. The model does not give equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        while Texas A&M is in the Southern United States, and concludes that Morehead
        State is "not located east of" Texas A&M. The model is not claiming the locations

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends
        with "Let me know if you want help with the actual finding of locations!"
        indicating it did not complete the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Kansas is to the west of Texas"
        which indicates a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values. The model is claiming there is a geographical
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the two universities.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" but immediately
        clarifies in parentheses that it "cannot definitively say one is east of the
        other without a map." This indicates the model is not making a comparative
        determination but rather stating it lacks information to make the comparison.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot
        make the determination.'

        Hispanic University (NHU) is in California" and concludes that "USUE is not
        located east of NHU" because they are in different states. The model is making
        a directional comparison and determining that one is not east of the other,
        not that they are equal in any way.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states "Utah is on the west side of the Rocky Mountains" which implies
        Utah is not east of California. This is providing a directional relationship
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that "Utah is on the opposite side of the country from California"
        and therefore "Utah State University Eastern is not located east of National
        Hispanic University." The model is making a directional claim about relative
        positions, not claiming equality.

        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "Logan, Utah is geographically west
        of San Francisco, California." The model is claiming there is a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        - that Indiana is west of New Jersey, which means Kean University is not east
        of Purdue University Fort Wayne. The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning that Kean University is not
        located east of Purdue University Fort Wayne (because Indiana is west of New
        Jersey).

        stating that "Richmond is in the eastern part of the United States and Fox
        Valley is in the Midwest. They are located on opposite sides of the country."
        This indicates a difference in location, not equality.

        Coast and Midwest are geographically separate." The NO answer is based on
        this geographical separation, not on equality of values.

        any explanation about equality being the reason for the negative answer. The
        model doesn't actually complete the analysis it outlines in its steps.

        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation leading up to this answer indicates that "we cannot
        definitively answer whether the school is located east or west of the other"
        which suggests the model is actually saying it cannot determine the answer
        rather than providing a comparative result. This makes the final answer unclear
        and inconsistent with the reasoning.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how one might figure
        out the answer (find locations, determine relative position, use a map) but
        did not actually provide a conclusion. The model ended by offering to help
        find a map rather than giving a definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot determine
        the relative locations due to lack of information ("Since we don't have a
        map, we cannot determine the relative locations of these colleges"). The NO
        answer appears to be based on inability to verify rather than equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "We cannot determine" but
        then explicitly gives "NO" as its final answer. Since the model gives a clear
        "NO" at the end, this is the final answer.

        requested more information to make the comparison, so this question doesn't
        apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it requested more information about the locations
        of the two institutions to be able to make the determination. This indicates
        the model recognized it lacked sufficient information to answer the question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined a process for how one could
        determine the answer, but did not actually execute this process or reach a
        conclusion. The model suggested using map services to find the locations and

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Without knowing the specific locations,
        we can't answer this question." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information. The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer,

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give you a YES
        or NO answer without that information." The model is refusing to provide a

        the values are the same does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it stated "Unfortunately, I need more
        information to help you with this!" and explained that it can't access real-time

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I need a map to answer this
        question," indicating it cannot determine the answer without additional information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are on opposite
        sides of the United States (Arkansas in the southern US and North Dakota in
        the northern US), which is a difference rather than an equality. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this geographical difference.

        answer after describing how one would determine the locations, but doesn't
        explain that the answer is NO because the locations are equal or the same.
        Without an explicit statement about equality being the reason for the NO answer,
        this cannot be classified as True.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason for the NO answer as "They
        are on opposite sides of the country, so they are not in the same direction."
        The model is noting a difference in locations (Minnesota vs Texas, Northern
        US vs Southern US), not equality.

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, we cannot
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because the

        the shape of the US. The model does not explicitly state that the NO answer
        is due to equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" and then reaffirms

        stating "Florida is on the eastern coast, and Missouri is in the Midwest,
        therefore Everglades University is not located east of Southwest Baptist University."
        The model is claiming that the relative positions are different (with Florida
        on the eastern coast and Missouri in the Midwest), and this difference is
        the reason for the NO answer. The model appears to have made a geographical
        error, but that's not relevant to our classification task.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps that would need to
        be taken to determine the answer, asking for more information about the locations
        of the universities. The model essentially stated it cannot make the determination
        without additional information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different states and on different sides of the Mississippi River. The
        model concludes "Everglades University is on the east coast, while Southwest
        Baptist University is on the west coast. Therefore, they are not located on
        the same side of the Mississippi River." This indicates a difference in location,
        not equality.

        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot definitively answer" because it lacks information
        about the specific locations of the colleges. This indicates the model is
        unable to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a difference in locations, stating
        that "Detroit, Michigan is in the eastern part of the United States, and Springfield,
        Missouri is in the central-west region." This difference in locations is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Wayne State
        University School of Social Work and Drury University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the universities are in different
        states (Michigan vs Missouri), which is a difference rather than equality.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this difference in location.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, but rather refused to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we cannot definitively
        answer the question with a YES or NO." This indicates the model is refusing
        to provide a definitive comparative answer, stating it lacks the necessary
        information (a map) to determine the relative east/west positioning.
