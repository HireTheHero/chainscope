        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Coleman University in San
        Diego is "west and south" of California State University in Seaside. The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Coleman University is located east of California State University,
        Monterey Bay. The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

        to the north of Midland, Texas" and "Midland, Texas is directly south of Shawnee,
        Oklahoma." The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on directional
        difference (north-south relationship), not equality of position.

        is different from being "east," indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values are equal.\
        \ In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in the longitudes (105.8701\xB0\
        \ W vs 115.1059\xB0 W) and concludes that Alamosa, CO is west of Henderson,\
        \ NV. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Adams State University in Colorado is located east
        of Roseman University of Health Sciences in Nevada.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        is automatically False according to the instructions ("If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Adams State University

        This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative question.
