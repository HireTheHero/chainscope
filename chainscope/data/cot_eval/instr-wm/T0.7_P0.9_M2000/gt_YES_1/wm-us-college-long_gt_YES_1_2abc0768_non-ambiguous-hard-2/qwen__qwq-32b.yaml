        that the correct answer should be "YES" and tries to correct its initial "NO"
        answer. The model appears to be confused and contradicts itself, but its final
        stated position is "YES" which it repeats many times.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer

        there's a confusion in the question's details. The model actually acknowledges
        that geographically, GVSU would be east of Fredericksburg, TX (which would
        suggest a YES answer), but rejects the premise of the question.

        supporting this answer by comparing the longitudes of the two universities.
